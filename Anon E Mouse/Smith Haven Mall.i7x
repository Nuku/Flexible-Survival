Whether it was for aesthetics or the developer had the money, real marble tiles were used for the flooring and runs from the entrance into the large atrium.

With power having returned to the mall, some of the less infected have made their way to it to take refuge. It remains safe, for the most part, due to the diligence of the wolverine guards, though on occasion a feral manages to slip in before it, and anyone they had corrupted, being caught and ejected. Various planters, spaced evenly apart and continuing the theme of ancient Greek, line the middle of the walkway all the way to the entrance of Sears. A smaller fountain of Poseidon holding a trident while riding a platform supported by four dolphins, water weakly running from the porpoise's mouths, sits in front of the anchor store. Vendor kiosks, selling everything from sunglasses to cell phone covers, occupy most of the spaces between the planters. On the south side of the wing near the middle is the entrance to the super Target.

Heavily weathered columns had been made to look as if they are supporting the ceiling while the plastic chairs and tables are colored to imitate worn marble. Sitting in the center of the room is a small, simple fountain, the pool partially filled with dirty, standing water.

When you show him you[']re no harm, he calms and settles back into his seat. [one of]'I would suggest that you don[']t go in there. Part of the floor gave way and opened up into the utility tunnels and sewers. Now we need to stand guard against anything coming up out of there and getting into the mall. If you[']re still determined to go looking around in there, I won[']t stop you.' When you tell him you[']re still going in, he shrugs and hands you a lantern. 'Go ahead and take this then and be careful.'[or]'It[']s a right mess in thar. Part of tha['] floor opened up to the sew[']rs so we hafta watch fer anythin['] poppin['] up from them. Ya[']ll sure you wanna go scurryin['] about in thar?' When you nod your head, he shrugs then hands you a lantern. ‘Don[']t say ah didn['] warn ya…'[at random] Taking the lantern, you head into the restroom and find that it[']s in shambles. It seems a portion of it has been destroyed, what were once walls now just piles of rubble. From some of the broken faucets, water dribbles down the pipes and drips to the floor, forming small puddles. Curiosity driving you, you carefully make your way deeper inside until finding a fairly large hole in the floor.";
