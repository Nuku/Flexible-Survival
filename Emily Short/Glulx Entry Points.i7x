Version 10 of Glulx Entry Points (for Glulx only) by Emily Short begins here.

"Provides hooks to allow the author to write specialized multimedia behavior that would normally go through HandleGlkEvent. This is a rather dull utility library that will be of most use to authors wanting to write Glulx extensions compatible with other Glulx extensions already in use."

Section - Use option
[As of version 10, Glulx Entry Points has a somewhat more flexible approach to event handling than did earlier versions: Whereas the latter consulted one of eight separate rulebooks depending on the event type, Glulx Input Loops passes the event type into a single parameterized rulebook. This means, for example, that we can have a general rule for event handling that fires no matter what the event, alongside the usual event-based rules.

Many existing extensions are based on the older system, however, and we would break those extensions if we simply removed the older event-handling rulebooks. So, we retain those rulebooks. By default, Glulx Entry Points will still pass event-handling to those rulebooks. This means that existing code will continue to work as before, and we can also use the new parameterized rulebook if we like.

This use option disables the old rulebooks, and should be used only when we know that we are not using an extension that depends on the old rulebooks.]

Use direct event handling translates as (- Constant DIRECT_GLK_EVENT_HANDLING; -).


Section - New rulebooks

[This first set of rulebooks--the event-handling rulebooks--are now deprecated in favor of the "glulx input handling rulebook".]
The glulx timed activity rules is a rulebook.
The glulx redrawing rules is a rulebook.
The glulx arranging rules is a rulebook.
The glulx sound notification rules is a rulebook.
The glulx mouse input rules is a rulebook.
The glulx character input rules is a rulebook.
The glulx line input rules is a rulebook.
The glulx hyperlink rules is a rulebook.

The glulx zeroing-reference rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-windows rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-streams rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-filerefs rules is a rulebook.
The glulx object-updating rules is a rulebook.


Section - Global variables

Current glulx rock is a number that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved]
Current glulx rock-ref is a number that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved]

Glulx replacement command is some indexed text that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved]

Library input context is a number variable. [This describes the event context in which input was received, e.g. whether the Inform library was awaiting line input or char input. If 0, the library was awaiting line input, if 0, char input. This is not as useful as an event-typed value would be; with such a value, we could detect any input context--e.g., we are waiting for hyperlink input.]

Section - Event types

A g-event is a kind of value. The g-events are timer-event, char-event, line-event, mouse-event, arrange-event, redraw-event, sound-notify-event, and hyperlink-event.

Definition: A g-event is independent of the player if it is timer-event or it is sound-notify-event or it is arrange-event or it is redraw-event.

Definition: A g-event is dependent on the player if it is not independent of the player.

To decide which g-event is null-event: (- 0 -)


Section - Wrappers for event structure, return values, etc

To wait for glk input:
	(- glk_select(gg_event); -)

To decide whether the current input context is line input:
	if the library input context is 0, decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide whether the current input context is char/character input:
	if the library input context is 1, decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide which g-event is the current glk event:
	(- gg_event-->0 -)

To decide what number is the window of the current glk event:
	(- gg_event-->1 -)

To decide what number is the character code returned:
	(- gg_event-->2 -)

To return input replacement:
	(- return 2; -)

To return input continuation:
	(- return -1; -)


Section - Event Handling
[This is an I7 version of the event handling that was included in the I6 HandleGlkEvent routine in previous versions of Glulx Entry Points, with minor changes to allow any event type to provide a replacement command. Converted to I7 code in version 10.]

To decide what number is the value returned by glk event handling (this is the handle glk event rule):
	now glulx replacement command is "";
	follow the glulx input handling rules for the current glk event;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the replace player input outcome:
		return input replacement;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the require input to continue outcome:
		return input continuation;
	follow the command-counting rules;
	if the rule succeeded:
		follow the input-cancelling rules;
		follow the command-showing rules;
		follow the command-pasting rules;
		if the [command-pasting] rule succeeded:
			return input replacement.

	abide by the glulx character input rules.

Last glulx input handling rule for a line-event when the direct event handling option is not active (this is the redirect to GEP line input rule):
	follow the glulx line input rules;
	if the rule succeeded:
		replace player input.

Last glulx input handling rule for a mouse-event when the direct event handling option is not active (this is the redirect to GEP mouse input rule):
