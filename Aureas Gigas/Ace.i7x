Instead of resolving a Refueling:
	say "     As you travel down a dusty path through the forest you come across the ruins of an aged dollar store, the outside looks thoroughly ransacked with shards of glass from broken car windshields and shredded cardboard lies strewn all around park. Some plastic bags flutter listlessly about in the wind. A massive eighteen-wheeler in the back that has been flipped on side by a large redwood and two elms. One of back doors is open, indicating that the truck was being unloaded when P-Day started. Hoping to find some useful you peek inside to see a variety of boxes that have been shredded to bits. Based on the bite and scratch marks it would seem like a pack of wolves found cargo before you. The few boxes that seem relatively untouched contain items like laundry detergent, brooms, and paper towels. Makes sense that the feral beasts would ignore those remnants of society no longer useful in this postapocalyptic environment. With the truck a scavenging bust you venture in the back area of the store hoping to have more luck inside the storage room in back of the store.";
	say "     The faintly rusted hinges creak as you open the heavy metal door. Interestingly the storage room seems relatively untouched. Looks like the wolves weren't able to find a way inside this room. You prop open the door with a box of detergent and begin searching inside the storeroom. To your disappointment, the backroom seems relatively bereft of supplies, with only items like toys, electronic fans, and some cleaning products remaining. Unfortunately, it looks like you came here too late, and some other somewhat sane scavengers found and looted the place before you came in in. With the way the world is now, it makes sense that all the places known to have tons of supplies sitting out would be some of the first targets to get looted. As you walk by the door to the storefront, you hear some grunts and moans coming from the other side of the door. It seems like you are not the only one inside the store!";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Keeping a low profile, you step slowly and carefully as you try to find a vantage point to view origin of the sounds. Due to the way the sounds echo off the walls, the individuals responsible for the carnal sounds are in the front of the store. As you carefully walk down the frozen foods aisle, you can now see the figures responsible for making all the commotion by the checkout station, Izzy the cuckooess who has a penchant for getting pounded by hot studs, and 'Ace' the former fighter jet pilot turned anthro osprey who was convinced by Izzy and her mate Gray to join their small settlement. The pair are engaged in a serious make out session, their beaks pressed close and tongues sensually moving together. Not content with simply some oral action, the couple's hands begins to roam across each other's bodies.";
	say "     With a domineering tone, the former military man exclaims, 'So the horny little slut couldn't wait until she got back to camp to serve her master's cock.' His taloned hand squeezes one of her breasts then runs it down her slim waist and the small of her back before firmly grabbing the needy femmes ass. The licentious woman moans and replies cheekily, 'I always get what I want, flyboy.' She then unzips his flight suit and reaches for his crotch while whispering, 'And I think you want what I want as well...' She then pulls out the hunky males girthy ten inch cock and starts stroking it. Once his cock is fully erect, the osprey pushes his submissive partner onto the checkout counter and spreads her legs. The brown and white feathered pilot then lines his cock to rub up against the folds of the vivacious damsels cunt. 'Beg for it...I need to know who owns this pussy' commands the raptor as he wraps a hand around his pliant paramour. Pleading with a sense of desperate need, the slender female begs, 'You... Sir!'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Pleased with the response he was given, the commanding stud of bird plunges his rod into his birdy woman's pussy. Izzy lets out a loud ecstatic moan, she her eyes to focus purely on the sensation of the ten-inch penis going inside of her. With a cocky look in his eye Ace starts thrusting slowly but deeply, making sure to hit the g-spot. Whimpering softly, the naughty hotwife begins to grip the edge of counter. Wanting to tease the wanton avian, the seahawk pulls out his cock, waits for a few seconds, then slams it into the depth of his white feathered sub. Not expecting to get penetrated at that exact moment. The bent over female's arms are jostled, knocking over a small magazine stand, sending a dozen celebrity gossip mags careening to the floor.";
	say "     Opening her eyes, the lustful damsel gets a mischievous look and taunts, 'That all you can do? And here I thought fighter pilots were experts at hitting things fast and hard.' Inflamed by the biting comments, the ex-pilot forcefully grabs the back of his companion's head and utters, 'Oh I can do fast and hard...' He then slams his rod back into her womanhood and delivers a fierce swat to her booty. The cuckooess flinches from the pain, but that does not prevent the dommy raptor from continuing to spank her ass. The sound of the strong strikes echoes through the store. You see a hint of redness on the skin underneath the feathers. Once he feels his female partner's impudence has been fully punished, he orders her to give him a good view of her holes. Wincing in pain, the femme spreads her cheeks, giving her bull the sight of her dripping pussy and asshole.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Emboldened by seeing his bratty sub turned into a lusty pliant mess, the athletic pilot begins fucking full force. The cuckoldress underneath him moans loudly and exclaims, 'Don't stop master! Keep going!' This encouragement is accompanied by the hotwife rocking her hips. The birdlike hunk muscles start to tense up as the pair climax. Letting out a loud cry the masculine avian unleashes his load into the adulteress's depths. The two take a short moment to catch their breath before looking around and noticing your presence. Recognizing you, the cuckoo female greets you warmly, 'Nice seeing you again! Did you like the view?' You walk over and explain how you were scouting the location for supplies and heard some noises and wanted to investigate. The pair look at two shopping carts filled with supplies, Ace says, 'Sorry we kinda took all the supplies here. Though if you were willing, I'd pay you to escort us back to camp with a bit of the food.' It seems like an easy job to get a bit of food, if you are interested.";
	say "     [bold type]Do you want help the pair haul the food back to their camp?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Help.";

	if Player consents:
		say "     The prospect of food for a quick deviation sounds pretty good so you agree. 'Let's get this show on the road then.' the osprey cheerily commands. While walking down a trail back to their settlement, the former pilot and you get to talking about your background with the city. Curious about his background you ask him about his. Nostalgia echoes through his voice as he begins, 'Flying as always been a big part of my life. My mom was a flight attendant for Blue Jay Airways and dad was a mechanic at an airport. We used to go to a lot of air shows back when I was kid. The flight maneuvers were amazing to watch, and I imagined pulling some of the crazy tricks. I figured the best way to do that would be a pilot for the Air Force. I hope I'm still able to fly after all this.' The tone of his voice indicates the passion he has for his profession.";
		say "     While Ace and you chat further, a rustling in a bush puts you on edge, but when a tiny rabbit hops out, the three of you relax. Feeling a little left out Izzy asks, 'Hey Ace, you never told me how you ended up crashed here.' The osprey eyes gaze into the distance as he replies, 'My wingman Kaye and I were off on a recon mission checking on some unusual movement on radar. Keeping track of the movements of some of the bigger threats to a containment breach like behemoths, sea dragons and wyverns is important. I saw a duo of the dragons flying circles around group of individuals hiding inside of a minivan. I decided to save them. I shot a missile at one, while the other was gunned down by my wing mate. We started to leave when a third one ambushed us from behind, trying gunk up Kayes['] engines. I decided to take the drake on at close range to save my friend. I was successful but the hull got scratched up pretty bad so I had to eject.' The bold actions in story seem to make Izzy have even more desire for the stud.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     As you approach the settlement, you can see that the campsite is somewhat different than the humble place you saw previously. The settlement seems a lot more fortified, the most notable addition being a watchtower made using a hunters blind from a camping store. Inside the tower is a petite anthro sparrow who shouts out, 'Ace and Izzy are back! They brought supplies too!' A couple of inhabitants come out to help Ace get the various foodstuffs from out of the shopping carts and into a large tent for storage. Meanwhile, Izzy goes off to find her spouse Gray inside their tent. The cuckolded husband is busy reading a book. The cuckooess stands over her hubby, announcing her presence, 'Hey dear, I'm back. Ace and I found a lot of food, but we decided to make you a special creampie...' The slender male looks up to see her cum-filled pussy. With a sense of quiet contentment, the guy responds, 'Well, I can't refuse something made just for me...' He then begins to lap at her white-glazed folds.";
		say "     With the loving couple of to their usual shenanigans, you walk back to the carts which are almost empty. The former Air-Force officer begins handing out some oatmeal cream pies to some of the members of the settlement, remembering the other snacking going on in the cuckoo tent, you chuckle to yourself. A slender secretary bird begins conversing with the osprey stating, 'You didn't miss much while out on your excursion. A feral wolf tested the perimeter, but we were quickly alerted by the man on watch duty. The canine seemed scared off by the commotion. Hopefully this means that the packs will be less likely to try and attack us.' The raptor cheerily proclaims, 'Good job! Being vigilant will help keep us safe from the threats the city possess.' Noticing you nearby, Ace motions for you to come forward.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     In good spirits, Ace tosses you two of the packaged snacks. You snicker a little at the dessert, which causes the muscular hunk to ask, 'What? You don't like creampies?' He then realizes why you are laughing as he sees the cuckooess getting eaten out. Stifling a laugh, the ex-pilot tries to maintain a professional demeanor and gives you a casual debriefing. 'Thanks for guarding Izzy and me on our return trip. I know it was uneventful, but this load of food was important for helping keep this settlement going.' You note that he seems like an important figure in this community. Proudly he declares, 'I gotta admit, it feels good to be useful for the people living here. I'm always surprised when I learn about the capabilities of these folk. Speaking of, I'd love to hear about your experiences the next time you come around.' You give your farewells and head back down the path hoping to see all of them another time.";

Instead of resolving a Jetlagged:
	now battleground is "void"; [prevents a random fight, as these are replacement random fights]
	say "     While traveling through the woods you decide to check on the small settlement where Izzy, Gray, and Ace are located. Walking down the trail leading to the campsite, you notice that the path seems wider and much more well-worn than before. The variety of hoofed, clawed, and taloned footprints in the mud, highlight the variety of foot-traffic that has traveled towards your destination. As you approach a curve in the footpath caused by a massive redwood, you hear variety of clangs, chatter, and flapping of fabric with the wind. The sleepy campsite has surely grown. As you get your first sight of the campgrounds, you notice that the ramshackle makeshift defenses made from bits of wood and scrap metal have been replaced with some proper wooden barriers. You can even see a metal shipping container in the northern section of the camp.";
	say "     As you gaze upon the changed settlement, a person blurts out, '[']Scuze me. Coming through.' When you move to one side of the trail, you see a white anthro bull who seems vaguely familiar walk past you. Following shortly behind is a portly anthro warthog. Both are wearing large hiking packs. Various items inside clank with every step taken. The shorter porcine fellow inquires, 'Marsden, where are you headed?' The bovine replies, 'Argos Antiques. One of the settlers here found some antique jewelry.' With a wary look in his eyes, the warthog asks, 'Are sure that's a good idea? That Dmitri fellow seems sorta fishy to me.' Giving a flippant shrug, Marsden answers, 'Can't make a profit without taking some risks. Besides, I'm one of his best contacts. That peacock rarely ventures from the high rise district.' From what you can surmise, the pair are traders, some of the few sane people bold enough to venture through the unsafe areas of the city. While the two are out of earshot, you move towards the changed town.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As you approach the main entrance to the upgraded settlement, a tall anthro ostrich femme blocks your way. Wielding a long sharp spear with a hunk of scrap metal sharpened to a point for the spearhead, the gangly dame barks, 'State your intentions for coming to Staghorn!' You reply that Ace wished to speak with you about the city. Skeptical the seven foot tall guardian scoffs, 'A likely story.' However, to your luck, Gray comes walking by carrying a couple of water bottles. Noticing how the guard is hassling you, the male cuckoo greets you warmly stating, 'Hey there, it's been a little while since I last saw you.' He moves his arms affably to get the warden of the entrance to ease up. Moving you past the guard and into the camp your slim wayfarer whispers, 'Sorry about that. The camp is a bit on edge after a pair of miscreants attempted to rob from our food stash.' You tell him that you understand.";
	say "     As you are guided through the bustling campground, you see a multitude of avians engaged in different activities. You see an anthro Archaeopteryx smoking a cigarette while examining some plans of the expanding settlement. With a cheery tone, the guide chimes, 'Remember to take a break every once in a while, Mr. Vogel.' The workaholic dinosaur mutters under his breath, 'I'm not that old, you worrywart,' then gives an acknowledging handwave and once again focuses upon his task. Moving past the proto-bird's tent you see an anthro Turkey unloading a load of lumber from a small 4 wheel trailer designed to be hauled by ATVs. However instead of being hauled by a machine, the vehicle is towed by a giant twelve foot tall bird. You ask your companion about the strange bird that seems to come out of an old travelers' tale. Shrugging, Gray says glibly, 'Apparently it's called a Moa. It was from New Zealand before they went extinct. I dunno how one got here.' The two of you finally arrive at Ace's tent";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Stepping inside the tent, you see Ace sitting in a foldable chair with Izzy in his lap, the two are engaged in a bit of foreplay, the femme's arms are wrapped over the studs broad shoulders while he cradles her hips. Noticing you and Gray come in, the pilot turns his head and focuses his attention on you, warmly belting out, 'Welcome back! Please have a seat and tell about what your travels are like.' Sitting on a scavenged leather ottoman, you share your what has happened since last meeting him. After explaining your expeditions, you note that the camp looks pretty different than when you first started coming around. Ace lets out a mild laugh as he responds, 'The lovely couple Gray and Izzy had a big part in making happen. Given their habit of having fun with plenty of the sane survivors in the area, traders started coming through this area more often, encouraging more people to stay close by and develop the camp further.' You look at an embarrassed Gray, who absentmindedly puts a hand behind his hand.";
	say "     You then notice that there seem to be a lot of avians in the camp. Izzy snarkily retorts, 'As opposed to the city where you can't throw a stone without hitting a canine, feline, or dragon?' Her mild mannered partner responds, 'What about the gryphons?' to which the female replies, 'They're part feline, that doesn't count.' While the cuckolding couple argues about whether a gryphon counts as mostly avian or not, the former pilot provides a real answer, 'Izzy is somewhat astute with her observation, canines have great team dynamics, felines have great stealth attack capabilities, and the dragons have both good defense and offense. Us avians tend to have more fragile bodies, meaning we can't handle sustained combat. Most of the feathered folk here have been trying to lay low and stay alive. I don't doubt that Staghorn has helped out a lot of the birds living here now.' This sense of community is rare in the current environment.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     Noting how people keep calling the place Staghorn, you ask how the name came to be. The two cuckoos burst out laughing. With a knowing look on his face, the osprey sighs and mumbles, 'I'll let those two explain.' The curvy damsel starts to say, 'Before this place was fully established, it was just Gray and me out here. Apocalypse or not, I'm going to have some fun, so one time I found this big dicked anthro cervine. The guy was a little skittish, but I got him to sit under a pine tree while I sucked his cock. Everything was going good as usual until my dear beloved accidentally rustled the bushes he was hiding in. Naturally the jumpy deerman panicked and thought gray was a wolf. He then shoved me away and started running away. While dashing away, one of the horns got caught in a tree branch and broke off. Ever since then it's been an inside joke and good waypoint for giving directions.'";
	say "     Ace whispers in your ear, 'Staghorn was also a way to help put the non-avians feel at ease. A couple of the feathered newcomers were wanting to name the place the Nest. Besides being a cliche, I put the kibosh on that idea to keep our other inhabitants feeling unwelcome. There has been a bit of tension from between the new and old settler groups that I've have to keep defusing. One of the worst things that could happen to this place is getting fractured.' His eyes dart to outside the tent reminded of his duty of leading the town. A taloned hand strokes his face as the female cuckoo soothingly speaks, 'Sir, when you're in here with me, you don't have to worry about that.' The focus of raptor's eyes eases up and his muscles relax. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and Izzy's methods seem to help erase the former military officers burdens.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Deciding that some lighthearted conversation is needed, Ace shares a story of his youth in the Pacific northwest. And how one when he was fishing at lake with his family he was reeling in a whopper of a trout when a osprey snatched the fish out of the water breaking the line and leaving a feather in its wake. Taking the feather out of one of his pockets, the fighter pilot surmises, 'Maybe this good luck charm is what shaped my current form. Not that I'm complaining, I think my body works well for me.' You begin to feel restless, which can be sensed by stud. 'You seem like you're itching to get back on the trail. I'll see you out.' Exiting the tent, the former pilot states, 'I have to travel to work out some deals with some seagulls at the beach trading supplies for food. I might see you out and about.' He then moves close and whispers, 'And if you ever in the mood for the type of fun that Gray and Izzy have, I offer my services.' He then gives you happy parting words.";

The osprey pauses for a second before guiding you back to his tent, he temptingly says, 'You do seem to have a good eye for whether stuff is up to standards.' He begins to remove his jumpsuit showing his notably large tapered avian cock and hefty balls. With a ribald tone you utter, 'Quite a decent package, but I'm going to have to see what it looks like at the ready.' Your right hand softly run along the sides of the rod, while your fingertips gently tease his sack. The avian brings you closer and traces along the small of your back. The tip of his hardening length starts pressing up against your body. With a cocky attitude the raptor boasts, 'Us pilots know how to be ready for action at a moment's notice.'";

Noticing how you are staring, the cocksure ex-pilot boastfully states, 'I think you will enjoy it more with your mouth than with your eyes.' Wanting to test if the braggart is correct, you wrap your mouth around his shaft. Admittedly as the rod is being inserted into your maw, there is a pleasurable warmth to the pulsing member.

You nod your head while continuing the blowjob. Dribbles of saliva trickle out the side of your mouth. He grabs the back of your head forcing your solely to concentrate upon the dick lodged in your throat.

Still fondling his ass, you feel his glute muscles tense up as Ace starts cumming down your throat. Your throat starts gulping down the thick load that was shot in your mouth. Giving the former pilot a playful swat on the ass when you stop sucking his rod. Jokingly you report that his equipment is up to code. With a contented sigh your companion states, 'Told you so.'

Raising an eyebrow, then letting out an entertained laugh, the athletic gentleman states, 'That sounds like a fun idea. Why don't we go to my tent?' The two of you head to his living quarters and begin to seductively remove any clothing or equipment off of your body as a seductive display for your grateful host. While you are in the middle of putting on this show, the female cuckooess slowly enters the room. Quickly surmising what has happened, the adulteress fake pouts and utters, 'Sir, I thought that I was the only one allowed to service you in the camp.' The raptor responds, 'My companion's not a member of our settlement, but I don't think they would mind if you joined in.' The inclusion of another person would seem to encourage Ace to perform better, so you acquiesce and motion for the woman to join in on the fun.";

Meanwhile Ace is busy running his hands up and down your torso, while his beak gives some sensuous playful nips to your neck. When the ex-pilot's cock achieves full erectness, the manly avian jovially states, 'Izzy I think we have been terrible hosts, seeing as we have only been focused on getting me ready. My dear pet, why don't you help get our guest ready.' After taking a short sec to catch her breath, the vivacious femme acknowledges and responds, 'Can do sir.' She then moves behind you and begins lapping at the folds of your pussy. Her nimble tongue circles along your sensitive folds. She is careful to avoid actually entering your cunt, seemingly wanting Ace to be the first one to penetrate you.";

After you begin lying down on the queen sized mattress, the libertine damsel is ordered by her dom to lie on top of you, her supple breasts pressing against your torso. Looking at the pair of inviting pussies, Ace cockily proclaims, 'Well isn't this quite the inviting sight. I can't decide on which treat I want to try first.' He then teasingly thrusts his ten inches of man meat in between the two wet slits. You gasp and Izzy let out an amused yelp. Smugly the ex-military man insists, 'The one who I find more wanting will savor the prize first.' Wanting to be the first one to cum you plead with wanton lust louder than your competition.";

His well-trained athleticism means that the hunk is able to fuck you at full force slamming his thick cock deep inside you again and again. You start to orgasm, squirting on his engorged phallus. With you sated, Izzy becomes the focus of Aces attention. He starts to jackhammer his subs cunt. In between breaths, he utters, 'Better cum for me quick fuckslut.' the woman on top of you had fucked her partner enough times to star bucking your hips in perfect unison with his thrusts. Looking at the couples faces you can see both are on the verge of climax. Soon, the well-endowed soldier lets out a bird-like cry as he cums, his cock pulsing as he unloads his virile essence inside the cuckooess. Some of the cum leaking out of Izzy drops out of her pussy and onto you. While you recover from the experience, the two bird grabs some handkerchiefs and begins to clean you off.[fovichance]";

The athletic raptor is wearing his flightsuit taut against his muscles he has a back pack laden with supplies- and beside him is Vanessa, the flanks of her rear legs pressed against the wall. Looks like the centauress is having a seemingly friendly chat with the former pilot. But it might be more than just platonic, as you notice that she has her military jacket open wider than normal, baring her breasts fully. Trying as he might to look at the tauress's face, the avian pilot can't help but occasionally peek at Vanessa's breasts, his wagging a bit quicker every time he does. Curious of the things they're talking about, you wander a bit closer.";
	say "     Ace is the speaking at the moment and says, '...I think that allowing infected soldiers back into service would definitively be of use to the military. A lot of the infections keep troops in fighting form. I mean check out these guns.' He flexes his well toned biceps, the fabric grips his arms tightly. Vanessa wraps a hand around the muscle and teasingly says, 'Not bad for a flyboy. I didn't know daredevils like you had time to work out.' With an amused chuckle Ace playfully replies, 'It's something to do in the off time. And you're one to talk about daredevil acts, jumping out of a plane is not thing most sane people do.' The two soldiers laugh, but the conversation goes a bit more serious as Vanessa asks, 'Do you think the top brass is really going to be ok with a bunch of lusty mutants who might mess with squad cohesion?' A loud gale blows past as the osprey contemplates her answer.";

My vision is incredible, I can see a gryphon flying over by the ruins of the office building about three clicks away, Think how good that be a spotter for a sniper, or seeing bogeys from a much further distance while flying. Plus think of how many more supplies you can carry than the average trooper, or how you can evac a wounded squadmate in an emergency much quicker.' With a raise of her eyebrow, the equine infected woman sardonically blurts out, 'So I'm nothing but a glorified pack mule.' Speechless the hunks beak stays open for a couple of seconds before the infantrywoman starts chortling. Sliding in closer to the victim of her prank";

With a self assertive style, the raptor boasts, 'I know a couple of hotwives who would be willing to back up that statement and more if needed.' He then flexes his biceps while the lady runs a finger down his abs. Enticingly the tauress answers, 'Oh I definitely want more, but I don't know if you'll be up to the challenge. My first time in the city was with a hung centaur.' Her hand travels even further down his torso, stopping at the bulge in his pants.";

Besides, [if Player is female]she[else]he[end if] has let the doberman woman have her fun with that wolf that's been acting as our guard dog.

Slurping on his ten inch long rod spiritedly, the sucking sounds seems comparatively louder than a normal blowjob. Perhaps she knows that you are around, and wishes to taunt you. From your perspective, you can see that her black colored labial lips are dripping with arousal, revealing the pleasure she takes from this act.";

With a contented swagger the well-endowed officer closes his eyes and quietly mumbles, 'Keep it up, gorgeous. You're doing a great job.'

The former paratrooper gulps down a decent amount of cum, but gets pulled back from him, taking the next shot on her slightly equine face and her breasts and even a couple of drops land on the collar of her military jacket. Finishing his work Ace leans up against the wall taking a few deep breaths to recover. Standing up and walking over to a nearby dust cloth, Vanessa feeling quite puckish states, 'Not too bad, flyboy.

I modified the handle so that your hand talons will be better able to grip it.' The raptor's eyes stare intently as he examines his weapon.

Biting her lip temptingly, the red furred femme salaciously replies, 'You could say I have some experience...'

Fully understanding what the mechanic is getting at, Ace responds, 'I've got some food or water in my pack, but I think we can come to another type of arrangement though if you'd like.' He then runs one hand along the small of her back.
