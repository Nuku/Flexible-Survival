Despite this blemish, she seems to have a cheerful disposition, joking about her scar to show that you no one needs to be awkward about it. She is covered in black fur that appears to be well groomed and cared for. Two forest-green eyes twinkle as you study her, gazing leisurely around the room. She is dressed in a navy-blue skirt and a white short-sleeved shirt with a red cross above her left breast. You note that her claws are well maintained as she folds her arms, unintentionally accentuating her bust. From a cursory look, you would say they are B maybe C cup, but a raised eyebrow from her interrupts your judgment.";

Section 2 - Talking

Instead of conversing the Genevieve:
	say "     You indicate to the fox that you wish to talk to her for a minute. She eagerly smiles and looks at you, her tail wagging wildly.";

	say "     '[One of]I can't get over the poor quality of the bread in this country. Nowadays it is even worse, but even before the nanite outbreak, the bread lacked crunch and freshness. Maybe as population increases, quality goes, how do you say, [']down the plug[']? Feeding the masses and all that[or]SacrÃ© bleu, how am I going to tell my mother that I've got a large scar on my face? I suppose compared to being a fox now, minor facial maiming may be easier to explain... Priorities Genevieve, priorities[or]You know what they say about France? It is the land of passionate lovers and sumptuous food. But please don't make me mix the two. It would surely make my fur sticky and picking fox fur out of gateau is time that could be better spent eating or making love[or]I wasn't expecting to finish my nursing qualification in America, but someone convinced my mother that it would be a good idea. Other than the nanite plague, it has worked out well, I've met Dr' Fuchs, my hair is softer than it has ever been before, and I was top in my class when I graduated, but maman doesn't value many people's opinions so it begs the question; Who was it that convinced her? There aren't many people that she respects enough after all[or]Am I not the prettiest vixen that you've ever seen? No. Don't answer that. Because if you say no, I will have to devote too much of time to getting vengeance on you for such a cruel and hurtful lie, and I'm busy enough helping Dr. Fuchs as it is[at random].'";

Section 3 - Sex

Instead of fucking Genevieve:
	say "     The vixen, while pleased with you proposition, disappointedly shakes her head. 'While my heart quickens at your interest in me, ma chere, I cannot at the moment' she apologizes. 'Between my responsibilities to Dr. Fuchs when I am at the clinic, contnuing to unpack his luggage, and waiting on the more expensive medical equipment, I don't have much time for finding my pleasures in others. Hopefully it shouldn't be too long though.' A polite refusal, but a refusal nonetheless.";
