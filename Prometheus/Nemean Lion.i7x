Section 1 - Monster Responses

when play begins:
[These flags indicate which monster groups your creature belongs to, should someone want to remove any given type.]
	add { "Nemean Lion" } to infections of girl;
	add { "Nemean Lion" } to infections of guy;
	add { "Nemean Lion" } to infections of furry;
	add { "Nemean Lion" } to infections of Felinelist;      [list of feline infections]
	add { "Nemean Lion" } to infections of BarbedCocklist;   [List of creatures with a barbed cock]

to say losetoNemeanLion:
	say "     Collapsing from exhaustion, you look up at the victorious lion. Blood streams from a myriad of unhealing wounds pooling next to your crumpled body. You consider cursing the gods, but you made this decision. Curiosity got you killed by the cat. As you lose consciousness, you hear someone running up the hill with a masculine warcry.";

to say beattheNemeanLion:
	say "     Battered and bloody, you stand victorious over your foe. The Nemean Lion lies on its side, slipping in and out of consciousness as it tries to recover. Amazingly, despite all the punishment it has just received, its hide is still undamaged with only a few smears of dirt marring the golden fur. If the sizable feline manages to recover you aren't sure you'd be able to defeat it again as you're exhausted too. That said, you aren't sure what you are supposed to do next. Are you meant to skin the still living animal?";


to say NemeanLiondesc:
	say "     The giant feline glares at you in an appraising manner, possibly judging how much difficulty it is likely to face in defeating you. It's fur is a dull gold, undamaged by the centaurs['] arrows. An impressive dark brown mane surrounds its fierce face, long white fangs visible as it snarls at you. Deciding you are easy enough prey, the Nemean Lion pounces at you, dagger-like claws extended and fast approaching your face.";
