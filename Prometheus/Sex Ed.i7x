You're so focused on rubbernecking for any sign of where to go that you fail to notice a student ahead of you, and the frail-looking female harpy is sent sprawling with a squeak of shock as you bump into her. You desperately apologize, hoping that you haven't hurt her, and saying that you didn't see her. 'I realize that I'm small, but sheesh the number of times that I get walked into,' the young woman says good-naturedly, rubbing an elbow and turning to face you. She is wearing a short, backless blue dress, giving her wings freedom to move while maintaining a modicum of modesty. You are relieved to see that she appears unhurt and hasn't taken your accident personally. You explain that you were looking for a lecture to join.";

The lecturer taps the desk to request silence in preparation for the start of the lecture, the fifty or so students slowly complying. As you take your seat a few rows from the front, you take a quick glance at the lecturer in order to remember them for the future. Surprisingly, she is a pure human woman in her late twenties to early thirties, judging from her face, though with the nanites, who can tell properly anymore. Brown hair with a red streak is brushed over her ears into a loose ponytail. She catches you staring at her and smirks, winking one of her blue-green eyes. You blush and force your gaze away, noticing that she seems to have an assistant lecturer. He too looks fully human and of similar age, his brown hair cut short and is clean shaven. He also grins at your observation of him, and your blush deepens at being caught ogling again.";

While much of the content is now different in order to cover the bodies of a greater variety of the city residents, I thought that we could start off with a focus on our original subject animal, the human. I'm Doctor Vayne. I used to specialize in comparative biology, and my co-lecturer is my husband, Clyde.' He gives a small wave and stands beside her as she continues speaking.

		say "     'With current affairs, humans may seem to be the blandest creature wandering around the city and the college when compared to the mythical beasts that have developed recently. But even within humans, there is variety. Some have remained unaltered, either through isolation or care, while others appear human but have changed in other ways. Examples of this are the Spartans that are part of the college and the Vikings that some of you may have seen around the beach. As far as I am aware, these people still display normal human anatomy, though some may have swapped sex or had increased muscle mass and genital growth. But I'm getting ahead of myself as some of you may not have an advanced knowledge of the human anatomy, so I shall start there. Bear in mind that this is anatomy, not physiology, so most of the focus goes into appearance rather than function. I will however give a brief overview of some parts. For the purpose of education of course.'";
		say "     'I hope that this won't make any of you uncomfortable, but we will be teaching this class naked in order to use our bodies as the anatomical models. This is your chance to leave if you don't feel comfortable with this, but the dean will not be giving you a refund.' Unsurprisingly, no one moves, their attention still focused on the lecturers at the front. However, one hand goes up, quickly noticed by Dr. Vayne, who indicates for them to ask their question. The young male student hesitantly speaks, 'Would it be helpful if some of the human students unclothed and mirrored your demonstration so that those further from the front can see what you are doing more clearly?' The lecturer beams at this show of student participation, nodding her approval. A few people throughout the class strip, appreciative hoots and whistles accompanying their actions.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'We shall start with the circulatory system, considering that it is one of the most well known. The heart is the center of this system, pumping the blood throughout the body. The human heart has four chambers with two on each side. The upper two are referred to as the atriums and are where the blood enters from either the lungs or the rest of the body. This distinction is important as the blood cycles past the lungs to be oxygenated before returning to the heart to be pumped through the rest of the body. The heart should be beating in a regular rhythm that you can feel by holding your fingers to your neck or wrist. If you're feeling particularly bold and your partner is willing, you can probably also feel it through the chest here,' she informs the class, holding her hand over her left breast before demonstrating the same area on her husband. Some of the class does the same on the volunteers in the room, with a few stifled giggles.";
		say "     'It is important that you keep your hand still while doing this and keep your thumb away as it has a slightly different pulse. This means no kneading, massaging, or rubbing,' she says good-naturedly as she observes some of the more inventive ways of finding a pulse on the chest. 'Though doing so may allow you to notice the difference between a resting heartbeat and an excited one, but back to the lesson. The blood, after being oxygenated, is pumped through the body. The finer details aren't important for this course, but this blood goes everywhere from limbs to organs. The blood is also used when we get aroused, whether you possess male or female genitalia. In males, it allows the penis to get erect when aroused, as the blood flows into the vessels along the shaft, causing an erection, and the glans to widen. In females, the blood engorges the tissue around the vaginal passage and causes the clitoris to become more erect. These developments allow for sexual intercourse to be more comfortable and pleasurable. But we'll come back to this later.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     She goes onto talking about the respiratory system, breathing heavily to demonstrate the lungs taking in air to have the oxygen extracted. Many of the students watch her avidly, while those with volunteers nearby watch them instead. 'We shall move onto the digestive system, but don't worry, once we cover all of the systems that I feel are necessary, we'll take a more relaxed approach. This is mainly so that much of the knowledge can be applied to those of different forms. The digestive system begins at the mouth where humans usually insert food. From there, food goes down the esophagus, being rolled into a ball called a bolus and transferred down to the stomach through a process referred to as peristalsis. The stomach begins the process of digestion which continues in the intestines where the nutrients from inside of the food are extracted through the walls. The digestive system ends at the anus, where the food waste is expelled through the rectum.'";
		say "     'Similar to this is the urinary system which focuses more on liquid waste. The liquid that we drink is filtered through the kidneys for what is useful, with the rest being stored in the bladder as urine. Because some if this may be distasteful to some of the class, we won't go any further into it or discuss the excretory system. For those with an interest in this, the Kinks and Fetishes lectures may cover it later on in the course. Many of the systems overlap, allowing for some organs to fulfil multiple roles, depending on which process is taking place at that time.' She then briefly discusses the muscles of the body, her husband tensing different areas as she points to and names them. They both have toned bodies, with many in the class appreciatively ogling them as they teach.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'It is through the muscular system and our next subject, the skeletal system, that the body gets its shape. Once again, I apologize to those who thought there would be more sex involved. This is the framework upon which we shall build that. Without the bones and muscle that surrounds them, humans and other mundane vertebrates would lack structure and be more similar to octopi or slugs. For humans, the ability to walk upright on two legs gave us a major advantage over the development of quadrupeds, as we were able to see further and use our hands to defend ourselves. From the sexual viewpoint, to humor those of you in the audience for whom I am boring, this upright position has given us the ability to have many more inventive positions for sexual intercourse. I conclude this from having never seen a rhinoceros pressing his partner's back against a tree and breeding with her that way, or pile-driving her into the ground. Though with the current condition of the city, I imagine that such an event can't be too far away.'";
		say "     'Onto the reproductive system,' Dr. Vayne announces to the applause of the hall, causing she and her husband to smile. 'Anyone would think that students had sex on the brain near constantly,' she says teasingly as the class quietens down. 'The primary male sexual organs are the penis and the testes. The testes are held in the scrotum to maintain a stable temperature and protect them from physical harm. The female primary sexual organs are the vagina, and arguably, the breasts. We covered a bit on arousal during the circulatory system, so I won't repeat myself on that.' She gets her husband to seat himself on the edge of her desk, his erect shaft bobbing about as he moves. 'As you are unlikely to all be able to see the front, could some of you stimulate the male audience volunteers please? Not too much, we want to observe the erection before orgasm.' Charged by the lecture, the eager class complies, wrapping hands, paws, and mouths around the willing subjects.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     When every [']anatomical model['] is prepared, the lecturer continues with the class. 'Some of you may have noticed the change in size from flaccid to erect penis. This is due to the blood flowing into the shaft. A few of you may even have been observant enough to see the scrotum become tighter against the man's body. This becomes more pronounced as he gets closer to orgasm.' She wraps her hand around her husband's cock and begins to rub it up and down. 'While masturbation may be enjoyable, many people find it more thrilling for someone else to be the one stimulating them. This may be because they don't know exactly what is coming next,' she says squeezing the base, a groan breaking from her partner's mouth. 'So that those at the front can see this clearly, I shall continue with the handjob rather than switching to giving him oral sex. If the audience could do so too so that those around them can see.'";
		say "     'Some have the misguided idea that sex follows the order of hand, to mouth, before the more conventional vaginal or anal penetration. This doesn't always have to be the case.' Her hand is still moving, bringing her husband closer and closer to release. 'This is because lubrication is important; no one wants anything to [italic type]tear [roman type]do they? If you use a bottle of lube then there is little reason that you can't start with penetrative sex and even finish them off by hand or mouth.' Clyde taps the top of the desk, signaling his nearing climax. 'I want those at the front to watch carefully. See how different parts tense up as he orgasms. Those whom are watching the student volunteers, do the same for them when they climax.' Her hand movement accelerates, speeding towards a satisfying finish. With an ecstatic outburst, her partner begins to cum, semen splattering over his body, the lecturer's hand, and the desk.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Around the class, progressively more volunteers are brought to a similar finish, cum collecting on students and chairs. The scent of fresh sperm permeates throughout the room, accompanied by the relieved sighs of those who have orgasmed. It would seem that some of those watching couldn't help themselves either and have been masturbating as they observe the lesson. The lecturer's voice cuts through the collective euphoria, 'If everyone could listen to me again just for a moment while I discuss the female genitalia. Thank you. While the clitoris is often discussed when talking about female sexual pleasure, there is much more to arousing us than just tweaking the clit. Stimulation of the breasts, the vulva, and the vagina are important too.'";
		say "     Her husband allows her to sit on the edge of the desk, residual semen dripping from the tip of his cock. 'Once again, if volunteers could allow those near them to observe if they can't see the front clearly,' Clyde requests, taking over the lesson. 'To those of you with a clear view, my wife is obviously in a state of high arousal. This can be seen by the engorgement of the external lips of the vulva and the copious lubrication that is leaking in preparation for sexual intercourse. Some of the students in the class may be in a similar state, human or otherwise. If someone would be willing to manually stimulate each of the female volunteers with their hands, that would be greatly appreciated. The rest of you, please watch and take notes, either on paper or just mentally.' Throughout the room, several students that were closest to the volunteers crouch down and begin grazing their fingers over the vulvas of the volunteers.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Clyde continues the lecture as his fingers dance over his wife's slit, occasionally brushing over her clitoris, an occurrence that is signaled by a sharp intake of breath. 'With a bit of experimentation, you may find each person's favorite place to be touched. For many of you, this area will be internal, so if we insert a finger or two into the vagina, we can stimulate a greater area. Obviously, you will notice the difference in texture from the inside of an aroused vagina to that of the outside. I have heard the comparison between it and the inside of one's mouth. While you pleasure your partner internally, you can also continue outside with your thumb or other hand. You could also stimulate the area around the anus, or once again, penetrate it with your fingers. However, for this lecture, we shall not be covering that method. You could consider it extra credit,' he says, chuckling at his own joke.";
		say "     'If everyone could please withdraw their fingers from the, to put it crassly, [']anatomical models['], we shall begin oral stimulation. Many of you may enjoy the flavors. Some of you will not, and we encourage that these people to let someone else take over. Alternate between licking over the external lips, clitoris, and penetrating her with your tongue. This will help vary what it feels like which should boost her pleasure.' The sound of slurping is broken only by the interspersed moan, grunt, or other sound of enjoyment. You would imagine that the lecturers have had plenty of practice at this as Dr. Vayne grips her husband's head between her thighs, his greedy tongue flicking against her cunt. Fluid drips from the corner of the desk, and you are unsure whether it is fem-lube, saliva, or a mixture of both.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A cry of ecstasy makes you turn around, eager to watch the young woman brought to orgasm by whichever skilled student is between her legs. Much of the unoccupied class have followed suit and when the naga straightens up, he is greeted by the eyes of much of the class. He gives a sheepish smile and flicks his tongue a few times. 'Mmm, that tongue,' you hear his partner sigh as she comes down from her climax. It doesn't take much longer for the rest of the volunteers and Dr. Vayne to reach orgasm too, the scents of their fluids mixing with the earlier aroma. Breathing heavily, the female lecturer returns to taking the class. 'Someone managing to bring their partner to climax faster than my husband can, how exciting! But we've run out of time for this lecture. We hope to see you in the rest of the course. The next one's on Canine, Feline, and Equine anatomy.' As everyone shuffles around, packing bags, redressing, and chatting, she shouts over the din, 'I expect everyone to do some further study of humans. Remember, you may be tested on this.'";

Today's lecture is on the anatomy of mundane canines, felines, and equines. This means that we will not be specifically covering mythological beings and species similar to our own. Those may be covered in an extra credit lecture depending on how well the class does in the exam. There may be some similarities between our plane's animals and those of others, but be careful in applying this lesson to beings not native to our world. I wouldn't want something nasty to happen.'";

'When someone is discussing the phallus of a male dog, the first distinguishing feature most would bring up the bulb at the base of a canine's penis, more commonly referred to as the knot. The knot allows the male canine, while mating, to tie with his partner and reduce sperm leakage, thus improving chance of pregnancy. Now that I have ensured your attention, we shall begin the lecture properly.' The screen changes to a collage of dogs, wolves, foxes, and jackals. 'While the correct term is [']canidae['] as I shall be discussing foxes in the same group, I shall continue saying canines for ease of speech.'";

Canines are diverse in the environments that they can live in. From desert, to arctic, to urban areas, canines can thrive. They are intelligent and capable of adapting to improve their chances of survival.' The lecturer takes a breath before continuing. 'Now that you have some background, onto the anatomy. Canines are quadruped omnivores, though prefer meat to vegetables. They are covered in fur and have a tail that helps with balance but is also important for communication. While canine speech doesn't seem as advanced as that of humans, they use body language, yips, and howls to communicate. I would hope that I don't have to be too descriptive of what they look like. I'm beginning to feel foolish.'";

Having seen how well this went for the volunteers last time, a large proportion of the canine students throughout the class[if hp of Sylvia > 4], including Julian and Sylvia behind you,[end if] strip. 'Male canines are not erect before penetration, relying on a bone called the baculum to do so. Once inside of their partner, blood quickly fills the shaft, making it erect. According to a study by one of our students, this doesn't seem to be present in many of the canines in the city whom seem to be erect before penetrating anything. Once penetration is achieved, the male grips his partner and thrusts quickly and deeply.'";
	say "     'As the male nears climax, the bulbus glandis, the knot, enlarges, tying him with his partner. His thrusts will then be shorter, before orgasming. In feral canines, the male will then do a sort of turn so that he is facing away from his partner. This allows them to look for potential threats. Female genitalia is fairly similar to that of a human, so we won't discuss it much. The only thing that I feel I need to mention is that when the male's knot enlarges, the vaginal wall constricts around it to aid in sealing the semen inside. Tying can last up to thirty minutes in rare cases, so you can understand the threat that could be posed by someone or something coming upon them while they are in this state.'";

Putting some of the knowledge from the lectures into practice, you bring your thumb to her clit and fiddle with it as it engorges.

Felines originate in Africa and Asia but have a wide ecological niche, able to prosper in hot, cold, arid, or humid environments. They haven't adapted to urban habitats as effectively as canines, not including domestic cats, but are apex predators in areas that they are found. All feral felines are quadrupedal carnivores that are covered in fur that usually helps them camouflage into their surroundings. This helps them greatly as they are ambush predators. The cat's tail is an extremely important part of their body as due to their predisposition to climb, balance is key. Felines communicate through body language, hisses, and purrs.'";

Clyde sits on the edge of the desk to take a breath before continuing. 'Feline students may disrobe if they wish to in order to aid in this part of the lesson.' This request is keenly followed, with the many magnificent specimens of felinehood being put on display.

As a side note, while I may continue to say female, this is purely to maintain flow. I understand that some males have managed to get pregnant in the city, and I by no means have anything against homosexual partnerships. While the barbs stimulate ovulation, they aren't the most comfortable things to have inside oneself, and the female will yowl as they are withdrawn. These barbs also serve the purpose of scraping some of the semen from previous couplings from the reproductive channel, improving the chances of later partners of becoming fathers.'";

Outside of sexual anatomy, felines have some special features that we haven't mentioned so far. They have extra vertebrae in their spine which allow extra flexibility, a feature I'm sure that some of you have made use of,' he says with a smirk and an unsubtle wink. 'When you get licked by a cat, you may have noticed that the tongue was rough. This is due to the tongue having barbs of its own called papillae that act like a hair brush and aid with grooming. I'm not sure how many of you will have been interested in that, but it is anatomy nonetheless.'";

While not in a state of arousal, the penis is contained by a sheath of skin. It is worth noting that their testicles are also on the large side. Equines vary in size, as I'm sure that you are bored of us telling you, from miniature ponies to horses. Equines include zebras and donkeys, but it is also worth noting that horse is a very wide term in itself. Equines are found throughout the world though in reduced number in cold environments, preferring plains of temperate or arid climate. Urban environments are not ideal for equines.'";

If he held it against him, it would go from groin to a bit above his head. You guess that what they say about the size of donkeys has been magnified by the nanites. You also wonder how he manages to walk around without it hindering him. You finally see an equine near you, a small Shetland pony. He seems to have been overlooked by the majority of those around him. However, a magnificent green-scaled dragon and a husky bitch seem to have taken a liking to him. The dragon seems especially enamored by the smaller pony, a hint of scarlet poking from his genital slit.";

With that, he turns back to the pair behind him, kneeling to begin licking the horse's tail hole. Not being near any equines, you are free to look around the room for any groups that pique your interest. The donkey from earlier has four different students licking up and down his cock, the suggested group size all but forgotten. Between his thighs, a sleek male owl anthro brushes his wings over the equine's swollen testicles while he watches the others service the shaft. The zebra has a classmate nursing from her breasts, the milk dribbling down their chin showing that she is lactating.";

Some among you may recognize myself or my name. I did a documentary on territorial behavior in chimpanzees and have written several books on how to understand your cat's behavior.

All equines are quadrupedal with a solid single hoof at the end of each limb. If you don't know what a horse is by this time, you may wish to have a look in a picture book, use the internet, or explore the city. I would advise against the last choice as it may result in unwanted attentions. But onto the behavior of equines. Adults may spend seven hours a day sleeping, and while they lie down at night, they remain standing during the day as it allows them quicker mobility should they be threatened. For protection against flies, they roll in dirt and rub up against trees, which is also a good way to scratch an itch.'";

These herds usually consist of one dominant stallion with several mares along with their offspring. Adult males without females sometimes form bachelor groups which also bond closely to each other. The stability of the group is maintained even if the dominant male dies as the females are bonded to each other and will likely accept a new stallion to care for them. However, as the young mature, they usually leave the group, males being pushed out and females being abducted by other males to include in their own harems. Men are beasts no matter what species it would seem. Social grooming is an important part of maintaining bonds and involves rubbing against each other and nipping with lips and incisors, easing aggression.'";

The range of vocalizations that horses can produce in order to communicate is fairly wide from a nicker or neigh when meeting another, or a squeal when in pain. The also make use of body language such as curling their lips, swaying their tails, and ear positioning to make their intentions and opinions known. Flicking their tail around and flattening their ears often indicates displeasure and an intention to kick while active hostility usually includes bared teeth as well. Such behavior is easily noticeable, so you should be able to identify it should you come across any equine infections in the city, but the college takes no responsibility should you come to harm while not on college grounds or with an organized field trip.

They demonstrate the behavior that Dr. Lopez was talking about earlier, nipping and flicking their tails as they establish a hierarchy in their group. A lone zebra approaches the same watering hole, the dominant stallion watching closely from among his harem. Coming to a decision, he approaches the solitary equine, eager to establish dominance.

Someone must have had plenty of practice beforehand.";
		say "     The smaller zebra lets out a blissful moan as he sinks lower on the two massive cocks impaling his bowels, thrashing his head around as he takes more and more flesh. Stooping down to collect something from his bag, the lecturer straightens back up, holding a camera and pointing it at the couple on his desk and pressing a button. Their mating appears on the big screen in high enough definition to see the sheen of sweat on their skin. The male has pushed his partner's legs apart, anchoring her by holding her knees firmly against the desk surface. You are unsure whether they have become dislocated, but even if they have, there isn't a trace of pain in her moans as he pummels his groin against her. You can see as juices squirt from around the zebra's cock, their arousal in overdrive, as he repeatedly penetrates his mare, distending her vagina and causing a bulge to show through her abdomen.";

You can hear him gasping with exertion along with the slapping of his scrotum against her backside. With a loud bray, he climaxes, the contents of his balls filling her womb and splattering against his legs and the floor. 'I hope that you were given disclaimer forms informing you that the college doesn't take any responsibility for children who are not the progeny of a member of staff. If you don't wish to become pregnant, injections are available at the medical office.' You feel that this is directed at the class as a whole, but the breeding students don't seem to be paying much attention to it. The threesome on the floor also appears to have come to an end, semen pooling over the submissive zebra and spilling from his gaping anus as the two larger males finish cumming over his prostrate body.";

As the stallion orgasms, he drags his partner back against himself, penetrating her as deeply as he can. Her tummy begins to bulge with the copious sperm flooding her uterus, small splashes bursting from their tight joining as she shifts slightly. Before her womb can get too distended, the zebra withdraws and continues to shoot spooge over her naked breasts, a flood of white spilling out of her cunt and onto the floor, flowing around the male's hooves. Around the front of the room, panting equines lie in various stages of recovery, not one of them without at least some splash of cum on them, most fairly plastered in the potent fluid. 'And that concludes today's lesson I think. I hope to see you all again,' Dr. Lopez announces, carefully stepping around the spreading puddles of spooge.

'Today's lesson shall be on felines, mainly focusing on lions and tigers. But first, the cleaners have requested that we be a bit more considerate to them and don't make a mess like last time. The sheer amount of semen was intimidating I will admit, so there will not be an orgy at the end of this lecture. Instead, I've already selected two volunteers for our demonstration later. Thank you for your consideration, especially from the cleaning staff, but now onto the lecture. Shall we start with lions? Yes, we shall. Why? Because I say so. But time to learn!'

[end if]'While there are many similarities between different felines, lions, tigers, and house cats live in such different environments that their behaviors have had to adapt. Tigers don't have prides, and lions do not enjoy water nearly as much. Because of these differences, this lecture will look at these three different groups separately. So let us begin. Lions are mainly found in sub-saharan Africa though there is an endangered population in India. They are sexually dimorphic with males being larger and having the very recognizable mane.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Lions are the most social of the big cats, more often in large groups than any of the others. Most form groups called prides made up of related individuals and their offspring, and large groups usually consist of four males and eleven females. The females form bonds with one another and do not tolerate the intrusion of outside females into the pride. Members of the pride may leave for part of their lives to become nomadic, hunting alone or in a pair if they accompany another. Those that leave are usually treated with hostility by lions in prides, though lionesses in heat remain receptive to nomadic males for mating, a fact that I'm sure that the other males disapprove of greatly. After all, what sort of woman lets just any strong independent male try and impregnate her?'";
	say "     'The male members of a pride spend much of their time patrolling the edge of their territory while the females fulfill other roles. Most of the hunting is done by the lionesses, though some raise and protect the young when no one else is there to nurture them. Members usually remain in the same role for as long as they are a part of the pride, honing their skill in whatever role they put themselves in, even particular parts of the hunting group. This ensures that there is someone with experience to teach others or increase chances of success. Social bonds between lionesses allow them to hunt knowing that any cubs that they have are still being protected by someone else and that those who protect the young will still have access to food. If they were alone, they would not have these benefits.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'While all members will defend the pride from rivals, the males are better suited to this task due to their stockier build and the protection afforded to them by their thicker manes. This is also a chance for them to prove their worth to the females against others attempting to usurp their position in the pride.' He pauses, giving himself a chance to have a sip of water and allowing the class to catch up on their note-taking. 'Lions usually kill their prey through strangulation or asphyxiation, which aren't very nice ways of dying. They do this by clamping their jaws around their prey's neck or over their nose and mouth, both methods cutting oxygen off from the lungs. This has the side effect of weakening any struggles, an advantage for the lion and reducing chances of escape. Usually every member of the pride gets a share of the kill, even the old and weak. However, when food is scarce, it is usually the cubs that suffer the most. Lions are also willing to scavenge of other animals['] kills.'";
	say "     'Spotted hyenas and lions compete over food with lions usually able to push the smaller feliforms off of their kills, though in some areas of Africa, the opposite is true. We've covered social and predatory behavior, so it must be time to move onto sexual behavior. It may be of interest to some of you that homosexual interaction between lions is not uncommon though probably not to the same extent as is prevalent in the city and the college dormitories,' he jokes glancing around the room. 'When a lioness goes into heat, she may mate with more than one male, be they a member of the pride or a wandering nomad. Reproducing with the nomadic lions may improve the gene pool as they are less likely to be closely related, and the traits that have allowed them to survive alone may benefit future generations. Before any of you ask, yes, a male lion's penis is barbed for their partner's pleasure, albeit a possibly painful pleasure. It is theorized that this helps with ovulation.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'How many of you like sex?' This question is met with a few cheers, some guilty looks, and a few raised hands. The lecturer does a quick count and continues to speak. 'While a lioness is in heat, she may mate approximately every fifteen minutes whether it is day or night. I doubt many of you could keep up with that, and I think that I would be quite sore if I tried, so you can understand the advantage of having multiple males in a pride. Tag teaming to the extreme some of you might say, though some of you might manage with the changes. While mating, the dominant partner may grasp the back of the submissive partner's neck between their teeth, which may be a show of dominance or to enhance stimulation. In homosexual relationships, they often take turns being on top, so I would hope that they learn how best to please their partner in either position.'";
	say "     'And that concludes the section on lions. Are there any questions before we begin discussing tigers?' Nobody says anything, the scratch of pens on paper being the loudest noise. 'Okay then, let me tell you about Panthera tigris, the tiger. Distinctive features of the tiger are their stripes and their willingness to spend time in water. Different sub-species inhabit areas of Eastern Asia, not including Japan, and Siberia. They are largely solitary, with females caring for and traveling with their cubs until they mature but males only really interacting with others when a female is in estrus, sharing a kill, or competing with another male. A male usually has a larger territory that overlaps with several females['] smaller territories. allowing for multiple possible mates. Territory size is usually decided by access to prey, partners, and which will satisfy the needs of cubs while they are being raised.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Females usually establish their territory nearby that of their mother's, whereas males will try and claim territory further away, perhaps to reduce chances of inbreeding. They will leave their mother earlier than their sisters and will either find an unclaimed area or live in another's territory until they are strong enough to claim it from them. Unsurprisingly, many of these adolescent males don't survive until proper adulthood. Territory is marked through urine, scat, and claw marks, thus making olfactory as well as visual signs of ownership. Males also use anal gland scenting, which allows others to know who has claim to that area, including sex and the state of their heat cycle. Male tigers are usually less tolerant of other males entering their territory, but if one shows signs of submission, they are often allowed to remain as long as they avoid one another.'";
	say "     'Disagreements over territory are usually resolved through intimidation and posturing rather than physically fighting. It is better to be pushed out and still have the chance of claiming somewhere else than both weaken the other and die of your wounds. However, when competing for a female, males may cause great harm to each other with the possibility for fatalities. Males do not usually aid in the raising of cubs, but if the mother has died, then it is not unknown for the father to raise them instead, providing food and protection to ensure their survival. From an evolutionary standpoint, this is beneficial to him as he ensures the survival of his gene-line. There are also occasions where a male has remained with his family group, perhaps to protect those he loves, if we were to place human emotions upon them. An adolescent male who has yet to leave his mother will also hunt with his mother and siblings.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Tigers use facial expression, body language, and vocalizations to communicate. Bared teeth and flattened ears usually indicate fear or aggression, whereas upright ears and gently swaying tails are usually signs of affection or contentedness. Tigers also exhibit the Flehmen response, which I explained in the lecture on equine behavior, usually when sniffing urine of in heat females. Not only lions are capable of roaring, in fact, all big cats are capable of doing so, including tigers. This is often done in situations of aggression, competition, or success. If you had killed a large animal, you would want everyone to know about it, wouldn't you? Other sounds that tigers use include chuffing, purring, grunting, meowing, hissing, and growling.'";
	say "     'Tigers are capable swimmers, and their fondness for water is only shared by jaguars, a large cat that lives in the tropical climates of South America. Due to the tiger's strength at swimming, they have been known to catch their prey even while in water. Despite being mainly solitary, tigers sometimes share their kills with others, whether they are related or not, male or female. Females and cubs are even allowed to feed before a male has taken his share, and there is very little competition between those present, unlike in lions. Sort of unexpected, isn't it? Lions hunt in groups but compete over food, whereas tigers hunt mainly alone but are willing to share amicably with nearly anyone else. Perhaps the majesty of tigers is reflected by the majesty of their actions. Such beautiful creatures.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Tigers['] main source of prey are animals such as deer, boar, and buffalo but are also known to eat dogs, leopards, snakes, crocodiles, and even bears. As you can probably tell from this list, tigers are the apex predators of their habitat. They are also willing to eat smaller prey when convenient. They rarely hunt prey as large as elephants and rhinoceros, but from time to time, it happens, usually the calves, though there were reports of tigers attacking the elephants that were ridden in tiger hunts in the colonial era. When living in similar areas to humans, they may supplement their diet with livestock such as cattle and horses as they are similar size to their usual prey and are less capable of fighting back. There are also records of tigers preying on humans, which probably isn't surprising as they are easy prey and highly nutritious. I jest, but humans don't require as much effort as an elephant. Occasionally, tigers will eat fruit, but they shouldn't really be included as part of their diet, so do not include that in any exam answers.'";
	say "     'Tigers are a mainly nocturnal predator, especially in areas where humans are present, increasing their chance of a successful ambush. Where humans are not present, they have been caught on remote camera hunting during the day, suggesting that humans may be perceived as a threat or that they interfere with the tigers['] hunt in some way. Tigers are usually solitary hunters, relying on surprise and strength to knock their prey off balance and grip their throat, strangling them. This is especially important for larger prey that may fight back as their ability to defend themselves is severely hindered if they are on their side and rapidly running out of oxygen. Because of the dangers such prey might pose should the ambush fail, tigers, if they lose the element of surprise, may give up the hunt and move on, or prey on the young, whom are less capable adversaries. Small prey are usually just killed through the crushing force of their jaws. If they aren't already dangerous enough, they have enough force behind a swipe with their claws to break the back of a bear. Sobering, isn't it?'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'An interesting capability of tigers is that when hunting sambars, a sort of deer in India, they are capable of imitating the male's rutting call, attracting the females into a trap. Be careful, as some of the transformed in the city may have adapted this talent for other species. Despite their size, tigers do have competitors and threats other than humans. Animals that compete for the same resources are undoubtedly going to clash at times. These confrontations usually end in the tiger's favor either through intimidation or superior fighting capability, though crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes have been known to succeed in repelling a tiger, sometimes even killing them. For those of you who do not know what a dhole is, they are canines that inhabit south-eastern areas of Asia. They are also known as Asiatic Wild Dogs.'";
	say "     'I don't have much to cover on the mating behavior of tigers as it is fairly similar to that of other cats, but there are some differences. If you have been listening, you will know that tigers don't live in large groups for males to take turns with the female, but they don't mate much less frequently than lions. One male may mate with her up to fifty-two times in a day. How many of you have that sort of stamina, or a sufficiently low refractory period for that matter? When the male has successfully ejaculated, he has to quickly evade the female's swipe with a paw, and I would hope that you remember how much force can be behind that. The female then rolls on to her back to improve the path for the semen to reach her womb. A note to remember, this is only done with tigers who have established dominance in that territory. If she mates with a transient tiger, she does not roll over, reducing the chance that there will be a successful conception.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'And that brings a conclusion to the material that I am required to teach you on felines. You may have noticed that we didn't discuss domestic cats. Unfortunately, the university doesn't have enough funding for as many lectures as they used to, which I hope doesn't come as much of a surprise considering the circumstances, but I promised you a demonstration of feline sexual behavior to finish the class.

Evelyn, reciprocating his affection, cradles his balls in her hand as he moves slightly to the side, allowing the class a better view. Their actions grow more heated as their stroking and rubbing stokes their amour towards each other, the occasional nip and hiss being dispersed amongst the caresses.

While Evenlyn's penis isn't as large as many of the beasts roaming the city, it certainly isn't to be scoffed at, especially by pre-nanite standards.

Once she has finished showing off, her lover is standing between her legs with his shaft rubbing against her pussy, the barbs brushing against her clitoris.

The two of them seem to have become oblivious to the enthralled audience as Evenlyn takes a step forward and adjusts the angle of his shaft, the tip slipping through the juice to settle just inside the outer lips of her cunt, penetration but a thrust away.
