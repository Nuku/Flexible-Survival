		say "     Maeve is an anthropomorphic female wolf with silky white fur. Always coming up with hare-brained schemes, she is the type to attempt something without fully thinking through the execution or the possible outcomes, leaving her in awkward situations that require her family, usually Bernard, to help her out of. She is not above using her usual nakedness to grab someone's attention before lulling them into a sense of safety, false or otherwise, her C-cup breasts swaying hypnotically in time with her hips, the black lips of her vulva peeking out occasionally. While she has no training in proper hypnotism, you doubt that she would be above learning such arts to complement her current grasp of magic tricks and misdirection.";
		say "     You realize that you have been staring at Maeve for longer than you had intended and that she is looking back at you, a cheeky smirk on her face. Outwardly friendly and agreeable, it can be difficult at times to be sure that she isn't working some angle or buttering someone up for later fun. Despite her mischievous ways, she is well liked by her family, especially when she is hyping her next [']get rich quick['] scheme that any sensible person would be skeptical of, or performing magic tricks using sleight of hand. She is especially close to Bernard, the contrast between them only serving to further complement their respective capabilities when out scavenging.";

Considering there are a lot of things that are incredible about the city these days you can't help but wonder what she is looking for specifically. 'While it's true that there are a lot of weird [']n wacky things going on in the city, I was more wondering if you had seen or found anything in the realm of the occult while you were out.' Hearing this, you can't help but chuckle and tell her that you haven't been to the realm of the occult lately and thus haven't been able to bring her back any souvenirs. Maeve laughs at your glib reply and says, 'Funny. Here I was under the impression that you had been spirited away into another realm during your long absences from the Library. Regardless of the conspiracy theories, I'm happy that I'm wrong about that.' She then gives you a hug that you return in kind.";
