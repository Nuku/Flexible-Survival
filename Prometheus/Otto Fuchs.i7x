Do you assume that I raid the hospital, or perhaps you believe that I break into Zephyr as I definitely won't work for them?' You stand there patiently as he calms his amusement.

	say "     While exploring, you hear a burst of gunfire over the usual noises of the city. It doesn't sound far off, and you decide to investigate further. As you round the corner, you see an anthro rabbit lying on the pavement, holding his shoulder as blood seeps between his fingers. Standing a few feet away from him, rifle still raised, is a soldier who seems to have been separated from his group. 'You shot me. Why?' the lagomorph questions the brooding soldier, his gray fur progressively staining. Across the street, a door slams open, and a short, smartly-dressed man hurries over with a satchel grasped in one hand, distracting the soldier before he can answer. He looks like he is about to fire, but when he catches sight of you approaching as well, his aim twitches around, unsure what to do. You raise your hands as you approach, showing that you have no ill intent and tell him that you heard some shots and were curious what had happened. By this time, the other human has reached the rabbit, dropping to a crouch and opening his bag to reveal a basic first aid kit and pulling on a pair of surgical gloves.";
	say "     'What happened?' the older man asks authoritatively as he pulls the rabbit's hand away from the shoulder and swabs the wound. 'He shot me as I came out of my home,' the leporine cries, hissing as the swab rubs over the wound. 'Lower the gun, young man. You are going to cause trouble if you are not careful. Trust me, I am a doctor.' The German accent might have been considered novel were it not for the appearance that he is an uninfected human living within the city. The soldier seems to ignore the suggestion, training the rifle on the doctor as he treats the injured rabbit. Sighing, the older man stops cleaning the wound and turns to face the scared soldier. 'You are pointing a gun at a medical professional as they attempt to treat a patient. Now, I will not fight back should you decide to shoot. I have taken a Hippocratic Oath. I am not allowed to attack you, but I have helped a few people around here. I do not judge by species. After all, change allows progress. The help that I give the community means that many of them are quite fond of me.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'This fondness means that should you kill me, and you could do so fairly easily as I do not heal as well as so many of the transformed, there would literally be a mob of angry bears and wolves that would not let you leave in the same state as you are now.' The lecture seems to have some effect on the soldier, as he lowers his weapon but maintains a watch over you all as the doctor begins to stitch the wound closed. 'I do not believe that you have answered why you shot the rabbit yet. Care to explain?' the older man asks. 'He gave me a fright coming out of the door, and I thought that I was about to be attacked,' the soldier replies sullenly. 'I can understand the cordon, but why the military has to send troops wandering around the city I don't understand,' the rabbit comments groggily. The young man snaps, 'None of your business, freak.' The glare he receives from the doctor could freeze a phoenix. 'Leave. Now.' The amount of disgust in those two words drives the soldier to obey immediately.";
	say "     As he leaves, you approach the patient and his healer, asking whether you can be of assistance. The doctor gives you a brief smile, saying, 'I can understand why you did not get closer before, but the difficult bit is past. Now, his body should fix itself. But we should not leave him in the street. Let us take him into my home while he recovers. Ah, but where are my manners? My name is Otto Fuchs. I am a medical doctor, if you still respect the profession after seeing the state of the hospital.' You have to admit, he does seem to be less... sex-crazed than the staff there. 'Can you walk, young sir?' he asks the rabbit, helping him to stand. The leporine doesn't bother to answer, instead refusing the aid and standing alone before taking a few confidant steps. 'He shot me in the shoulder, not the leg, doc, but thank you. I should be alright now,' he says cheerfully, especially for someone recovering from a gunshot wound.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Suit yourself,' Otto grunts, carefully removing his gloves and stuffing them into a plastic bag. The rabbit walks back up the steps to his home, rolling his shoulder to make sure there isn't any permanent damage. Unsurprisingly, like most of the other infected, his ability to recover from harm seems to be phenomenal and from looking at him, you wouldn't believe he had been shot several minutes ago. As he opens the door, he waves and calls out thanks to you both. You turn back to Dr. Fuchs as he finishes closing his bag and straightens up again. 'I appreciate the concern that you showed for that young man. Many might have run the opposite direction, so thank you. I would say that I hope to see you again, but you might not want to hear that from a doctor,' he says with a chuckle. 'So instead, I shall wish you well and hope to see you under fairer circumstances.' With that, he trudges back across the road and enters his own apartment. As you leave the area, you thank your lucky stars that there are still sane doctors in the city.";

	say "     As you exit from an alley, you realize that you are back on the same street you saw the German doctor. In front of you is the building in which the rabbit person resides. Your observations are interrupted by a figure staggering down the street clutching his side. You simultaneously realize that it is the same soldier as last time, and that there is an unhealthy amount of blood staining his uniform and trickling through his fingers. He reaches the road just opposite you, before crumpling to the ground, supporting himself with one arm while his other hand continues to staunch the bleeding. You are just deciding whether or not to get help when a rather well-dressed toad hurls open a door of one of the houses and rushes out. You step out of the shadows of the alleyway and see them run across to the doctor's home, their legs not suited to such movement. 'Dr. Fuchs, you're needed out here! It's an emergency! There is a severely wounded soldier collapsed in the street!' the amphibian shouts, pummeling his fist against the door.";
	say "     A few moments later, the middle-aged doctor opens the door and calls behind him, 'Bring the [']O-['] with you, Genevieve, and if you think that I've forgotten anything, bring that too.' Otto walks briskly towards the collapsed man, a large bag under one arm. He drops to a crouch beside the soldier and pulls a bottle of ethanol and some scissors from a pocket of the bag. Pulling on some rubber gloves, he gently positions the groaning soldier on his back, knees bent. Carefully cutting the shirt away, Dr. Fuchs exposes the wound to the eyes of all onlookers. Brutal tears have shredded the left side of his abdomen, and you are surprised he got this far. You approach, ready to offer any assistance that he might need. Otto looks up as you approach, a grim expression on his face. 'I have my assistant with me today, and I think that this might be a bit too specialized for you anyway,' he says before you can even ask. Deciding that giving him space to work may be the best that you can do, you back off, but continue to watch curiously, the spectacle drawing residents from their homes.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As if on cue, a petite vixen with fur the color of obsidian trots out of the house, a medical satchel over one shoulder and carrying a bowl of boiling water. Setting it down next to Dr. Fuchs, she addresses him, 'I brought this so that you could make sure that the equipment is still sterile.' He gives her a grateful smile as he places some scissors, forceps, and a small container of needles into the bubbling liquid. A few more residents have come out of their homes to see what the commotion is about. Dipping a cloth in the boiling water, Otto begins to wipe the wound, the soldier wincing and grunting in pain. 'Are you able to tell me what happened, young man? There is considerable damage, and yet you are neither mutating or healing,' the doctor softly asks his patient as he tends to him. The soldier seems about to answer when another voice does so before him.";
	say "     'He was in our turf, and we don't take kindly to the army sticking their nose where it isn't wanted,' a deep growly voice replies. You turn to see three hyenas wearing dirty leather approaching, wet blood dripping from their leader's arms. On his right hand, he wears a glove with sharpened metal attached, presumably the cause of the soldier's wounds. Such brutality causes a gasp from some of the people watching, a few returning inside fearfully. 'So if you could hand him back to us, I'll finish what I started,' the lead hyena continues, his cronies nodding menacingly and glaring at the remaining residents as if to say [']leave if you don't want any trouble[']. The black fox kneels down to take over the human's care as Otto stands up and faces the gang. 'I'm afraid that I can't do that. He is my patient now, so I must do all in my power to heal him,' he says repugnantly, the gang leader baring his teeth at this response.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Perhaps concerned about the doctor's safety when violence seems second nature to the hyena group before him, several larger beasts - an imposing tiger, a tattered-looking wolf, and a [']grinning['] crocodile - advance until they are flanking him and ensuring his protection. The hyenas seem to be gauging their chances of punishing Fuchs for his insolence until the wolf lets out a howl. The piercing cry seems to echo around the street and you would imagine through the city. A replying howl confirms your suspicions and seems to be a turning point for the gang of feliforms. 'This isn't over. He's going to die anyway, and I'll come back with more of the gang to teach you a lesson,' the leader of the group snarls. A snap from the crocodile hurries the hyenas['] retreat, rushing down the street and out of sight. Dr. Fuchs hurries back to his patient, the soldier's breathing becoming increasingly labored.";
	say "     'I don't know what to do. The damage is too extensive for me to treat without more advanced medical apparatus than I have available,' Otto glumly notes. 'And I doubt that the machines in the hospital are still in working order. The mystery is how this man hasn't transformed in anyway.' The soldier stirs, opening his eyes and taking a sharp breath through clenched teeth. 'We were given immunity boosters, doc,' he answers quietly. 'But it will be running out soon, so if you keep me alive for long enough, I might heal, but I have too much pride to want to be a hyena. I'll be damned if I let them gain any small victory,' he says determinedly. While the doctor's expression briefly lightened at such a simple explanation to the puzzle and the course of action that might remedy it, the soldier's unwillingness to become a hyena to save himself returns him to looking pensive. The choice between acceding to the soldier's wishes and thus letting him die, or sustaining him until the immunosuppressants wear off and letting him turn into a hyena conflict on his face.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     To everyone's surprise, the black fox pipes up with a suggestion. 'The transformation doesn't have to be into a hyena. We could try and infect him with another species. A blood sample might have a greater concentration of whatever it is causing the transformations, so if we inject it into him, medical arguments aside, it might overpower any remnants of hyena DNA.' The onlookers['] expressions vary from awe and curiosity to disgust. Dr Otto Fuchs rubs his chin as he thinks, contemplating the feasibility of the suggestion. 'I'm willing to try if you are,' the soldier croaks, his skin getting increasingly pale as his lifeblood pools on the road. 'I don't want to die if there is some merit to that idea.' Otto seems to come to a conclusion, 'It seems to be the only option left to save you, and it seems more ethical than either of the other two options. We just need a volunteer,' he states. To your surprise, the tiger and the crocodile both volunteer.";
	say "     'I wasn't expecting anyone to be willing to help me, as I'm sure word of what I did to that rabbit has spread,' the soldier says. Dr. Fuchs replies sympathetically, 'He survived and made a full physical recovery, but you're running out of time. It would seem that you have two volunteers, but you'll probably become their species so make your choice quickly but carefully. I understand that this will likely estrange you from the military, so you have my condolences,' The soldier looks thoughtful for a moment before looking at you. 'I remember you from last time. What do you think? Who should I accept a blood transfusion from?' He doesn't seem to have a preference, the whole situation probably dulling his ability to think.";

He flinches slightly as it penetrates his skin, the vulpine's paw scratching behind his ears to soothe him. Blood is sucked into the vacuum as she withdraws the plunger, the red liquid the dying soldier's last hope. The fox pulls the needle out of the tiger's arm and passes the syringe to her superior, Otto watching the soldier intently as he waits for the immunosuppressants to wear off. It doesn't take long for this to happen, the human letting out a pained shout as bones reform violently. The crocodile and the wolf quickly try and hold him still to prevent him hurting himself further. Not missing a beat, Dr. Fuchs inserts the needle with precision directly into the thrashing soldier's deltoid, steadily injecting the fluid.";
		say "     For a moment, you think that this has killed him as he becomes completely limp. You realize how very wrong you were when his thrashing resumes, and the pained screams increase in intensity. Several of the onlookers turn away and cover their ears. Dr. Fuchs, seeing how concerned many of you are, shouts over the soldier, 'Probably a mixture of the infections fighting each other, incompatibility in blood types, and just the transformation process's normal effects. If his mind survives this, his body will too.' You're not sure whether this is reassuring or not. Froth trickles from the corner of the transforming human's mouth as tawny-orange fur pushes through his skin and his bones realign. His face fills out, forming into that of... a tiger. It seems that the gamble has paid off. The worst of it seemingly over, his body is no longer rigid. The shouts stop too, becoming weak grunts as the last transformations occur.";

He has gained several inches in height, as well as elsewhere, judging from the size of his flaccid shaft. A cream-furred scrotum hangs between his legs, the fur on his inner thighs of similar color. He gently feels over his new body, especially interested in what his face feels like. 'I can hear so much more... and the smells. This is going to take some getting used to. Thank you, sir,' he addresses the tiger. 'I would have died if you hadn't all saved me. Thank you, Dr. Fuchs, and you, Miss?' he says turning to the fox, waiting for her name.

The young fox woman strokes the crocodile's shoulder as she brings the needle of the syringe to his arm. He flinches slightly as it penetrates his skin, the vulpine's paw rubbing beneath his chin to soothe him. Blood is sucked into the vacuum as she withdraws the plunger, the red liquid the dying soldier's last hope. The fox pulls the needle out of the crocodile's arm and passes the syringe to her superior, Otto watching the soldier intently as he waits for the immunosuppressants to wear off. It doesn't take long for this to happen, the human letting out a pained shout as bones reform violently. The tiger and the wolf quickly try and hold him still to prevent him hurting himself further. Not missing a beat, Dr. Fuchs inserts the needle with precision directly into the thrashing soldier's deltoid, steadily injecting the fluid.";
		say "     For a moment, you think that this has killed him as he becomes completely limp. You realize how very wrong you were when his thrashing resumes, and the pained screams increase in intensity. Several of the onlookers turn away and cover their ears. Dr. Fuchs, seeing how concerned many of you are, shouts over the soldier, 'Probably a mixture of the infections fighting each other, incompatibility in blood types, and just the transformation process's normal effects. If his mind survives this, his body will too.' You're not sure whether this is reassuring or not. Froth trickles from the corner of the transforming human's mouth as his skin toughens and his bones realign. His face elongates, forming into that of a crocodile. It seems that the gamble has paid off. The worst of it seemingly over, his body is no longer rigid. The shouts stop too, becoming weak grunts as the last transformations occur.";

Between his legs, there is an absence of external genitalia, a discrete slit hopefully containing his penis. He gently feels over his new body, especially interested in what his face feels like. 'I can taste so much more... and the smells. This is going to take some getting used to. Thank you, sir,' he addresses the crocodile. 'I would have died if you hadn't all saved me.

That wouldn't have gone nearly as well without you,' Otto addresses the wolf, gratitude obvious on his face. 'It would be a lot easier if you would accept the Den Mother's offer of protection, but we understand that you can help more people out here. But I better report to my Alpha, be careful, Otto.' He drops to all fours and runs down a side street, towards where you heard the howl earlier. Looking surprisingly grim, the larger tiger steps up to the doctor and rests his paw on his shoulder. 'We need to talk in private about what just happened.' Fuchs's shoulders slump, but he nods.

	say "     Curious about how Dr. Fuchs is getting on since last time, you walk at a leisurely pace through the city back to the street he lives on. To your surprise, outside of the doctor's home, a group of four large wolves seem to be waiting. You begin to advance on them, concerned that they may be here with malicious intent. They have yet to register your approach and seem startled when you shout at them, asking what they think they are doing loitering outside Otto's house. One of them rises up onto two legs and addresses you, 'You seem to misunderstand why we are here. We wish no harm on Dr. Fuchs, not at all. We're here to help him travel to a new residence since some of the locals don't like the trouble they feel he brings here. The Den Mother sent us to ensure his safety given the services he provides to those in need. Are you well acquainted with him?' the now bipedal wolf asks.";
	say "     More relaxed now that they have explained themselves, you tell him your name and explain your previous encounters with Dr. Fuchs. 'Ah yes, he told us about you. Please forgive me for not recognizing you, but with the changes some people go through in the city, physical descriptions don't always count for much. My name is Argos, a senior pack member for the Den Mother and Pack Alpha. I'm sure Otto would prefer you to accompany us as well, if that is alright with you.' The door opens as the wolf says this, and Otto and Genevieve appear, heaving large suitcases. 'Oh it's you,' the doctor exclaims, letting go of the suitcase to come and talk to you, his companion beside him. You realize that you never told him your name and quickly remedy this, blushing slightly when the svelte fox grasps your head and kisses you on both cheeks as greeting.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Dr. Fuchs turns to address the leader of the wolves, 'So someone will come by to shift the medical equipment at some point, ja?' Receiving a nod in reply, he picks up his luggage again with a sigh. 'I'm going to miss this place. I've lived here for so long, but I can understand that they feel that my continued residence here may cause problems for the locals.' You assume by [']they['] that he means the tiger and crocodile. 'Ah well, time to go. Are you ready, Genevieve?' Replying in the affirmative, she turns to pick up the other suitcase, only to find that Argos is already carrying it. He gives her a grin and jokes, 'I'm all for gender equality, but you aren't the largest of people, and this isn't light.' The petite fox smiles and replies, 'Remind me to thank you later when we return to the Den,' Everything seemingly ready, your small group sets off towards Otto's new home, eyes watching you from behind curtains.";
	say "     Argos watches the rear while his pack-mates scout ahead and to the sides to ensure that the party won't be ambushed. You engage the two medical personnel in a quiet conversation after offering to carry the doctor's bag. He gratefully passes it to you, the hefty case dragging your body sideways before you quickly compensate. 'Tell me about yourself [name of Player],' Dr. Fuchs asks. 'You don't seem concerned about roaming the city, but nor do you look like you are with the military.' You give him a quick rundown of why you are here and what you have been doing since the transformations began. Genevieve and Argos listen intently, your tale especially enthralling to the pretty young fox. 'You seem to have had a few adventures,' the vulpine comments, a faint French accent noticeable now that nothing urgent is occurring around you. You bashfully shrug your shoulders and say that you suppose you have. It is then that a shout from ahead catches everyone's attention.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Responding to the noise, the reconnoitering wolves return to guard the group as you advance together. Suddenly, Argos firmly tells you all to stop, his nostrils flaring and his ears pressed back. 'Hyenas approaching from upwind. I can't tell exactly how many, and they smell different from the usual Hyena Gang. We could continue to check on the shout ahead, but it may be part of a trap. Or we can try and disappear down the side streets, but if someone is in need of assistance up ahead, we'll be leaving them to the mercies of the city. Otto Fuchs and Genevieve both seem to be favoring checking on the source of the shout, but they look at you to await your opinion.";
	say "     Someone may need the help of a doctor, and he seems fairly well defended at the moment so you tell them that you agree with their choice to continue onwards. The group tries to increase their pace, Genevieve casting concerned looks behind you as you stride forward. You reach an intersection covered in the rubble of a collapsed building. Large chunks of concrete grant numerous hiding places to a potential ambusher, a fact not lost on you or the wolves. 'Is anyone out there? Help! I think I've broken my ankle,' a feminine voice cries from further in. Argos looks unhappy with the situation and gestures for you all to stop. 'My pack and I will remain out here to protect you from the hyenas, but if this is a trap, then you'll have to rely on [name of Player]. Try and be as quick as is safe. The apartments are just down the street.' You give a nod and follow Otto and his nurse into the debris.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Not too far in, you reach the source of the cries for help. A red panda woman is leaning against a lump of concrete clutching her foot. It would seem that this isn't an ambush. Upon seeing the woman, Otto's eyes widen, and he rushes forward, dropping to his knees beside her. 'Emma, what are you doing here? I thought you had moved across the city last week,' he exclaims, his hands gently manipulating the flesh around her ankle. Emma winces at the touch but replies, 'It didn't feel like home. I missed Claude, Mike, and, of course, you. So I decided to come back, and I thought that I'd be okay as long as I moved from building to building rather than being in the open. Unfortunately, I met a territorial mutt in one and got chased here. I managed to climb up the piece of rubble behind me, but I slipped coming down again once he had left. But why are you here? And who is the stranger?'";
	say "     Otto explains who you are and why you are here while he searches through his bag. '... and they asked me to leave so that the hyenas wouldn't threaten the people living there looking for me. I'm on my way to the Green Apartments in the hope that I can still be of use to people there,' Dr. Fuchs finishes. Snarling from outside of the rubble catches your ear, and you can hear Argos growling menacingly. 'Back off. Fuchs and Renard are under the Pack's protection, and I believe you've been warned before.' A cold voice replies, 'He was warned too before interfering in our punishment of the intruder. We outnumber you, now kindly piss off, or be a good dog and die.' Deciding that you are needed less here than out there, you hurry back the way you came.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As the confrontation come into view, you can see that the wolves are well outnumbered against sixteen hyenas. The metal-gloved hyenas smirks in recognition at seeing you, a distraction that Argos takes advantage of. Grabbing hold of the gang member's shoulders, he rams a knee between the feliform's legs, eliciting a pained yelp, before shoving him back into the milling hyenas. Still cupping his groin, you hear their leader snarl for them to attack. You rush forth, but a wolf blocks your charge and pulls you back again. 'Wait,' he whispers as he releases you. Your confusion is only deepened by what comes next. The air appears to become stained black around Argos, making him appear larger and much more feral. An unearthly howl breaks forth from his maw, startling the approaching gang members. 'This is your final warning. Leave now and cease pursuing Doctor Fuchs, or there will be harsh consequences,' the wolf threatens, surrounded by shadow.";
	say "     Most of the hyenas begin to flee, the shadow wolf terrifying them utterly. Only two remain with their leader, cowering and baring their teeth in defense of their superior. 'Fine,' the gang leader barks, 'he isn't worth dying over.' He retreats with the remaining hyenas to who-knows-where, leaving you wondering what you had just witnessed. When all of the hyenas have disappeared from view, Argos relaxes slightly, and the shadow seems to bleed from the air back into his fur. He sees your semi-fearful look. 'It's a gift from the Den Mother, an illusion. You might think of it as rune magic, but it doesn't use Nordic symbols. One use only I'm afraid, and it used a lot of energy, but it served its purpose,' he explains. Hearing that the conflict has been averted, Otto and Genevieve shuffle out of the ruins, supporting the limping red panda. 'A rather bad sprained ankle that I'll look at further once we arrive at the apartment,' Dr. Fuchs states. Two wolves dash in to fetch the luggage before you continue on your way.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     It doesn't take you more than ten minutes to reach your destination at the Green Apartments, even with the injured woman. 'Would you like us to carry your bags to your room, doctor?' one of the wolves asks, receiving a nod and a thank you from the middle-aged human. 'If you don't mind me leaving you here, I'll take Emma inside and have a better look at her foot,' Fuchs addresses you and the wolves. 'Your help was invaluable, and once again I am in your debt.' He gives a small bow before aiding the panda through the front door. Genevieve instead opts to give everyone a hug, Argos being given a wink in addition. She turns to face you, 'Dr. Fuchs will be here, should you need him or just want to shelter from the city for a bit. But really, thank you. I wouldn't mind seeing more of you either,' the vulpine says, softly biting her bottom lip. With that, she follows her superior, leaving you with the pack.";
	say "     'We'll probably be seeing you again in future, I'm sure,' Argos says readying to return to wherever he resides. One of the wolves gives you a salute, much to the amusement of some of his friends. 'I would appreciate it if you had the time to check on Otto every now and again. He's a good man, but he has a tendency to help anyone who needs help. Something to do with the importance of his principles. But as you saw from the outcasts of the hyena gang, some victims have enemies that don't want them saved.' He pats you on the shoulder before dropping to all fours and loping away, followed by his pack-mates. Giving a smile and waving as they leave, you now have to decide what to do next.";

instead of going to Green Lobby while HP of Otto is 3:
	say "     Entering the lobby of the apartment building, you almost collide with someone, profusely apologizing before you realize that it is Dr. Fuchs. Looking around, you frown as you notice a pile of baggage with Genevieve sitting atop it. She waves as she spots you, hopping up and walking over and give you a quick hug before stepping back so that you can talk to the doctor. You begin to question whether he is being evicted from another home, but he shakes his head. 'Not exactly. Someone seems to have claimed the apartment that I thought would be mine. They are quite determined not to move so Genevieve and I have had to make do with living in the lobby,' Otto explains, noticeably perspiring. 'I don't want to involve the Pack, but nor can I remain out here where it isn't safe.' It would appear that he is in quite the conundrum.";
	say "     Looking around, you ask whether he has tried the ground-floor apartments to see whether they have anyone living in them. 'That was one of the first things that Genevieve did, but she said that they were occupied too,' Dr. Fuchs replies before the fox chimes in, '1C wasn't, but it didn't have a floor.' You walk over to one of the doors, 1A, and are about to knock but upon noticing the words 'Carnivorous Furniture' spray-painted across it. A quick look reveals that 1B and 1D are similarly marked. With a shrug you turn back to the doctor and explain what the doors say and that you can probably get rid of the monsters inside. 'Carnivorous Furniture? What rot! The nanites are unable to animate inanimate objects or the deceased,' Otto grumbles. 'Next time, tell me what the signs say, girl,' he mutters at the female vulpine, who looks embarrassed. 'It sounded scary and I didn't wish to risk being hurt,' she says defensively, earning a snort from the older man. 'Pull out the nails and lets go in. Genevieve, how about you go first to make sure a table with sharp teeth doesn't get me, ja?' Otto teases her. You're sure that whatever the fox is saying under her breath isn't polite, but she complies anyway once you remove the obstructions from the doorway.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Peering in after her, the room is dark, almost unnaturally so, and you are sure that you can hear skittering. Maybe there is someone living here and that they put up the warnings to deter trespassers. 'I don't like this Otto. I can barely see a thing. Could you get a torch for me sil vous plait?' Genevieve asks, fear soaking her voice. The doctor crouches beside the bags and begins to rifle through, his movement drawing your attention away from the fox. Just as Otto manages to find a torch, the scuttling sound from room becomes louder and the vulpine nurse lets out a shocked gasp and stumbles back against you, tripping and falling to her knees. Turning back, you are in time to see what looks like a chair, its feet tipped with jagged claws and a maw full of teeth on the seat, leap at Genevieve and lash out with one of its legs, slashing down her face and cause her to scream in agony, blood welling past her paws as she puts them up to protect her face. Without giving much thought, you drag her out of the room with one hand and savagely kick the monster, making it leap back with a snarl. As soon as it is back inside, you pull the door closed with a slam, hearing whatever it was angrily battering from the other side, with others joining it as the noise increases. 'Carnivorous Furniture' seems to have been an accurate warning.";
	say "     Dr. Fuchs reacts swiftly upon the situation taking a disastrous turn, grabbing a medkit from a bag before leaping across to attend to the fox. Genevieve is still sobbing, an increasing amount of blood glistening on her dark fur, but she has enough sense of mind to move her paws aside to allow the doctor to examine the wound. The sharp intake of breath indicates that something is very wrong. 'I need you to search my bags and find an effigy of a fox. Now. Tip everything out if necessary,' Otto orders you, his voice strained with urgency. 'Once you find it, smash it on the floor. The Den Mother gave it to me in case I ever needed her help.' Hurrying past him, you see Genevieve faint, her breaths quick and shallow. 'Oh my sweet girl, hang on a little longer...' Otto says under his breath. As you desperately tip suitcases and bags upside down, the doctor impatiently shouts, 'The wound is all the way down to the bone. If you don't find it soon, there is going to be permanent damage. The nanites usually repair the host, but she isn't healing. I don't know what those creatures were, but they've injured Genvieve beyond the nanite's help, and mine.'";

You wait a few seconds for something to happen before the fragments seem to dissolve into a white smoke that obscures everything from view for a moment before clearing again, two additional figures now in the room with you. You recognize them as Cadmea and Sirius, the Den Mother and Pack Alpha of there little group, the larger black-furred wolf standing protectively over the smaller white-furred vulpine. They barely acknowledge your presence before quickly moving to beside the doctor and Genevieve. 'What happened? How can I help?' Cadmea asks before gasping as she sees the state that the injured fox is in. 'We were going to move into the room over there, but some sort of creature attacked Genevieve before I had even reached the door. The wound isn't healing and I didn't know what else to do,' Dr. Fuchs quickly explains on the verge of tears.";

You wait a few seconds for something to happen before the fragments seem to dissolve into a white smoke that obscures everything from view for a moment before clearing again, two additional figures now in the room with you. One is a imposing bipedal wolf with fur so dark that it appears to leech some of the light around him, his posture protective of the other arrival, a smaller white-furred kitsune with seven tails fanning out behind her and wearing a tunic like garb protecting her modesty, though the slight swell of her chest suggests that she is female and in all likelihood the Den Mother that Otto was so desperate to come. They don't even acknowledge your presence, quickly moving to beside the doctor and Genevieve. 'What happened? How can I help?' the kitsune asks before gasping as she sees the state that the injured fox is in. 'We were going to move into the room over there, but some sort of creature attacked Genevieve before I had even reached the door. The wound isn't healing and I didn't know what else to do,' Dr. Fuchs quickly explains on the verge of tears.";
	say "     'Sirius, clear out the room for them,' the kitsune addresses the wolf. 'Then come back here as this will drain my life force significantly and I'll need your company more than ever.' Sirius looks concernedly at her before doing as she asks, rapidly opening the door, entering the room, and slamming the door behind him to prevent escape from whatever onslaught is coming. The Den Mother for her part drops to her knees beside Genevieve and lays her paws on her face, the fox whining slightly despite being unconscious. You approach slightly to see what is happening, Otto standing up and stepping back to join you and give the vulpine woman some space. 'She is a healer on her world, or so I was told upon meeting them, so I hope that her magic can do what the nanites can not,' the doctor muses as he looks on anxiously. You give his shoulder a reassuring squeeze and watch the kitsune in silence.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A silvery light radiates from her hands and bathes Genevieve's face in its brightness before she presses her paws to the wound, stifling the light except for a small sliver that is visible where they touch. You are vaguely aware of smashing sounds and growls through the wall but most of your attention remains devoted to watching the Den Mother's arcane healing. Shockingly, the kitsune seems to wither as she continues, her fur losing its fullness and her skin tightening over her bones in a ghastly display. Despite the effect that it is having on her, she continues until finally she gently lifts her paws away and slumps backwards, only spared having her head collide with the floor by your quick reaction of leaping forth and catching her. Laying her gently down, you turn to see how Genevieve fares, pleasantly surprised to see that there isn't any blood or wound on her face, though a vicious-looking scar remains. 'I'm sorry. That was the best that I could do with so little magic in this realm,' the kitsune croaks, the exertion of healing having greatly drained her.";
	say "     'Your best has been more than enough. Other than a little scarring, you wouldn't know that she had ever been injured,' Dr. Fuchs replies, crouching down to stroke the fur atop his nurse's head. It is at this point that you realize that the crashes from the room have stopped and you give the Den Mother a worried look. Has Sirius been overwhelmed? Her cloudy lilac eyes meet your own and she softly smiles, 'While whatever is in there is extraordinarily evil, he has faced down much worse things than this city has to offer.' As if on cue, the door opens again and the Pack Alpha walks out, his fur barely ruffled, approaching at a sedate pace. 'You've pushed yourself a bit much haven't you Cadmea?' he comments, sitting down beside the kitsune and carefully lifting her into his lap. She weakly slaps him, replying, 'But you didn't push yourself at all, did you?' earning a chuckle in response, though you do notice some tenseness around his eyes betraying the concern behind his outward cheer.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Tenderly smoothing some of the dull fur of her neck, Sirius looks at the consequences of the kitsune healing Genevieve before lifting one of her paws and pressing it to his chest. 'Go on then. My life is yours to share,' the wolf softly murmurs. You momentarily wonder what he means before a similar silvery light to before forms a tether between his body and the Den Mother's paw. Otto looks concerned, but the wolf quickly calms him by explaining, 'I am gifting her some of my life energies so that she can recover enough to return to our Sanctuary where the magic of our plane seeps into your world.' This seems to be enough for the doctor so you decide not to question it further, especially as when the process finishes, Sirius looks as healthy as before while Cadmea has regained some of the shine to her fur. 'Thank you, dear one. What would I do without you?' the kitsune says before unsteadily clambering to her feet again, supporting herself against his side.";
	say "     'When Genevieve wakes again, she will remember being attacked, but I have removed the feeling of trauma that came with it, and I do mean removed. It won't resurface or be triggered. I thought it for the best,' the Den Mother tiredly explains, one of Sirius's paws ready on her shoulder to ensure that even if she loses her footing, that she won't fall. 'The room is clear now and I couldn't detect any life or magic in either of the other unoccupied rooms,' the wolf adds, looking the doctor in the eye. 'They disintegrated completely when smashed, so I would say that they are from some fell realm rather than a product of this world's science. On the bright side, this means that there isn't anything to clean up before you move in.' He is about to say something else, but Genevieve begins to stir and opens her eyes groggily. She looks around and blinks a few times before recognizing the two leaders of the Pack. 'It was that bad?' the fox asks ruefully before standing up, Otto lending her a hand as she stumbles.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'I apologize that I must leave you again so soon, but despite the energy gifted to me by Sirius, I need to get back to the Sanctuary to properly recover,' Cadmea interjects. 'I know that Genevieve has only just recovered, but on top of the magic expended, I also breached some rules by healing you and there will likely be an archon justiciar coming to exact punishment. Think of them like your angels, but considerably less merciful. You don't want to be nearby when he or she arrives as by rights I am allowed to invoke a trial by combat. If I am within Sanctuary, I can access I barren realm to defend myself in rather than risking the occupants of this city.' Dr. Fuchs and Genevieve look as confused as you feel, but recognize the gravity of the situation and quickly, but sincerely, thank her and bid her farewell. Amusingly, rather than let Cadmea walk, Sirius scoops her up in his arms and sets of at a brisk pace, cradling her smaller form in his arms as he exits through the front door.";
	say "     'I hope that she will be alright. I feel like this is my fault.' Watching them leave, your thoughts are interrupted by Genevieve's voice, quickly followed by Otto shushing her. 'She knew what the price for helping you would be and she did so willingly. If it is anyone's fault, it is mine for telling you to go into that room. If anything had happened to you...' He doesn't finish the sentence and you turn back to look at them, the older man hugging the vixen with relief, the fox returning his embrace. 'Don't worry about me. With a scar like this, I might get more sympathy from the others in the hotel when I go back. It doesn't hurt either. Think of it as added character rather than a healed wound.' Genevieve is back to her usual cheerful self, looking in a mirror to see the damage, blowing kisses to herself playfully. You wonder how much is natural resilience, and how much is that the kitsune made her forget the agony and fear of the scar's creation...";

	say "     Don't let us keep you,' Otto calls to you, 'We'll move our things in at our own pace. Those tables have shown me that sitting in the hall for a bit isn't as bad as I had thought.' While he isn't explicitly telling you to leave, you get the impression that he is putting on a brave face for you and that he needs some time to contemplate the recent brush with tragedy. With a smile, you bid the two of them goodbye and walk out the door, leaving the two medical professionals to relax against their luggage, Dr. Fuchs looking distinctly gray and exhausted.";
