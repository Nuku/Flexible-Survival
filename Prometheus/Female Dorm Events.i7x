Curious, you follow the song down the hall and peek through an ajar door after making sure no one else is around. Inside, you can see that this is the female communal shower, and from the sound, the location of the voice. You slip in unnoticed and peer around the corner to observe whomever is washing. A slender brown cat-girl is lathering soap over her naked body, her eyes closed, and humming to herself. As she cleans herself, she lets out sounds of contentment, the knots in her muscles loosening as she works her fingers over them. Perhaps deciding that she has washed herself enough, she rinses herself off and opens her eyes, causing you to quickly attempt to duck out of sight. You hear a small giggle suggesting you weren't quick enough, but that she doesn't care that she has a voyeur.";

Meanwhile, her tail flits around the side and twitches in front of her pussy, the tip brushing her gash. The student lets out a gasp, the added excitement of an observer heightening her arousal. You consider joining her, but decide against it, not wishing to ruin the moment. She turns around and bends over, running her hands up over her ankles and up her legs. This gives you an unimpeded view of her ass and cunt, the moisture dripping from them unclear whether it is water or juices of arousal. When she reaches her thighs, she turns to face you again before twitching an ear and grabbing her towel. Taking this as your cue to leave, you stealthily slip out of the showers again. Just in time it would seem, as soon as you have taken a few steps down the corridor, a group of girls in various states of undress walk around the corner, towels tucked under their arms or over their shoulders.";

	say "     As you walk past an open door in the female dorm, you see a female gorgon hunched over her paper strewn desk. Atop her head is a shower cap with pictures of elephants and clouds. It stirs and undulates; the covered snakes seem restless. Leaning over her shoulder, a male bipedal dragon is explaining the similarities in myth between different cultures. 'As you can see here, the Greek interpretation of a dragon was more like a very large serpent and were associated with Ares, the god of war and courage, whereas here, the Christians portray dragons more as how the western world views them today, with four legs, wings, and breathing fire. They are also more often associated with the Devil in traditional literature,' the dragon explains, giving the young woman a soft squeeze.";
	say "     The gorgon quickly writes something down before turning around to face her tutor, her tail encircling his leg lightly. 'Thank you, what would I do without you,' she says gratefully. Her hands glide down his scaly arm as they gaze at each other fondly. It would seem that she doesn't have the same effect as Medusa. The female student guides the dragon out of your line of sight and you hear the creak of bed springs which you assume to be them sitting down. 'Now, tell me about your week, did you manage to finish your dissertation?' the young woman asks. 'I haven't managed much more. Barely any left, but so many interesting things have been happening recently and I enjoy helping you and the other students,' the tutor replies. As they begin discussing various other things, you give them more privacy, despite the open door, and return to the foyer.";

As you walk past one, you notice that the two naked young women inside, a tiger and a Nymph, who are just closing their books and sliding papers into them, lying on the floor. 'While I'm glad you could help me with the algebra, I still don't see why I had to be naked. Not that I haven't enjoyed admiring you,' the nymph says curiously, her eyes straying from the tiger's face over her chest as they both sit up. The feline smirks, and cups the other woman's cheek. 'You didn't think I was inviting you here just for study, did you? After all I never did pay you back for letting me copy your answers for last week's test...' she purrs. Her companion blushes and stretches her hand out, resting it on the soft fur of one of the big cat's breasts.

The two students wait a moment, both breathing heavily from arousal, before the nymph gasps as the tiger thrusts her tongue into her vagina. As her friend grinds against her face, the tigress caresses her ass with one hand and masturbates her own pussy with the other. Squelching noises fill the room as the students take their pleasure in each other. The completed assignment lies forgotten next to their writhing bodies. Cautious of disturbing them, you leave quietly, their moaning spilling into the hallway, much to the amusement of passing residents";

As you pass an open door, you see a male fox pressing different parts of a naked female wolf and asking what the bone he is touching is called. While the wolf has to ask for help with some, most of the time she gives confident answers that are correct. The study exercise seems to have had an effect on the fox, with a different sort of 'bone' appearing. As the female student stands up, her friend turns away in an attempt to hide the bulge in his trousers. The young lupine woman notices however, and grabs his hand to turn him back towards her. 'I would be insulted if you didn't get aroused placing your hands all over my body, so how about we do something to reward you?' she offers, removing his trousers.";

She shudders as his breath tickles the sensitive skin of her chest, letting out a needy moan. One of her hands grasps his vulpine cock, masturbating it slowly as her other hand strokes his back. Drawing back from her nipple, the male student crouches, dragging his shaft from her mouth, before licking her vulva. The wolf lets out a gasp, grabbing the back of his head and thrusting her groin against his eager face. After some time, with foreplay seemingly over, the wolf drags the fox across the room, out of your vision. You hear them sitting down on the bed, but the arrival of a group of laughing students means you cannot stay any longer. Shrugging to yourself, you turn and leave, returning to the foyer.";

How he hasn't been noticed by one of the dorm's residents you do not know, but touching objects that have probably had contact with the infected isn't a good idea if he wants to keep his unchanged form. 'All I need is someone's panties, then they'll let me in,' you can hear him muttering, pulling things from the bags before roughly shoving them back in. He pulls out a bottle of shampoo turning it around and reading the label. 'Renarde's Sexy Shampoo, bring out the vixen in you. Huh, sounds like someone wanted to feel better about themselves,' he mutters. 'Ew, looks like they spilled some,' the young man continues, wiping his hands on his shorts. 'Making me feel itchy, why would anyone put this in their hair, they'd be constantly scratching.'";
	say "     You can see a small patch of fur developing on the student's tummy, a development that doesn't take him long to notice too. 'Huh? What's this? Oh hell. No no no. I'd been so careful. Why did I let them talk me into stealing panties? Of course, a lot of them have transformed, so their things are probably unsafe.' You can see he is distressed and move in to try and help him. He has yet to notice you, more focused on his mutating body. 'It was the shampoo. It's got to be the shampoo. I got it on my hands and now this. Damn, I'm so stupid. I'm so ... warm. Mmm, that feels nice... Wait, are these breasts? Bring out the vixen in you it said. I guess that's more literal than they had intended but tells me what is happening to me. Perhaps this will make it easier for me to get a girl's underwear? No, the frat wouldn't want anything to do with me now I'm female, or worse, I'd be house bitch or something. Probably much more likely,' he says morosely.";

Tearing loudly, her shorts rip open from the growth of his hips and backside, a lush tail sweeping free from the fabric. Her body only covered by a stretched shirt, the newly transformed vixen admires herself in a mirror, feeling over her body curiously and giggling softly. She turns around, beginning to stoop for the shreds of her clothing when she catches sight of you. A blush shows through her fur, embarrassed about being caught in the girl's dormitory. Unfortunately for her, the gasp that she lets out upon seeing you is too much for her t-shirt, causing it to shred apart too, leaving her completely naked. With a squeak, she barrels past you, desperate to have some time to come to terms with today's events.";

	say "     Entering the foyer of the female dormitory, you are met by the firm breasts of a dragon-woman. Beside her is a familiar vixen looking nervous and trying to avoid the eyes of students as they walk past the doors. Both of them are completely devoid of clothing, the dragon proudly showing off her form. 'We of the Naturist's Club are always pleased to have new members, though it is unusual for someone not to have a room as part of the college,' the scaly woman says questioningly. The young fox stands on tippy-toes and whispers something in her ear, the posture accentuating her slim build. The senior student lets out a laugh and claps the surprised vulpine on the back. 'Serves you right for searching for a woman's unmentionables, though I'm glad you're taking to your new form so well.' It would seem that the fox's actions are neither uncommon or of great offense.";
	say "     The dragon takes her acquaintance by the shoulder and lopes down the hallway, the shorter vixen having to trot to keep up. 'Well then, we have several spare rooms from students that attempted to flee into the city or moved in with friends, so I'll get you a room near mine. That way I can make sure you're coping and you have a friendly face nearby. It'll also mean that other members of the club will see you, allowing you to make more friends with similar interests.' They stop outside a door, which the dragon unlocks, revealing a desk overseen by lots of pictures of dragons. 'This is mine, I'll have a word with one of the college administrators, either in the dorm or central building, but until then, if you don't mind, you can sleep on my floor. I have some spare blankets and pillows as Mum was quite determined to make sure I had everything I needed.' The vixen rushes forward and gives the larger woman a hug, her bright fur contrasting with the dark scales. 'Thank you,' she whimpers, pleased at such kindness.";

So, what is your favorite part of me? Breasts? Face? Legs? ... pussy?' The unabashed way in which she asks startles you, making you look at her blankly for a moment before hesitantly saying that her regal visage is probably her most striking feature. 'Probably lying, but flattery isn't unwelcome.' She pushes the shy vixen forward with her tail, though the fox doesn't cover herself, instead leaving her arms hanging limply at her sides. 'And my friend? What is your favorite aspect about her, and don't say face again or I won't let you look any more.' You let your eyes roam over the vulpine's svelte body, taking in her slender limbs, curvy body, and cute face. She speaks up, 'I would have thought you would know by now after watching me transform,' causing a chuckle from her companion again.";
	say "     'My my, aren't you the little voyeur. Ogling two girls as they walk around naked in the dorms even after catching one of them in the shower unawares. You really must have an appreciation for the female form.' The scaled woman's comments see to be raising the confidence of her companion, her posture becoming more relaxed. She begins to smile, understanding that she should find pleasure in showing of her body, and teasing rather than reprimanding those who seem obsessed with it. 'Perhaps I'll see you another time, maybe let you have a closer look, away from the judgement of others,' the vixen offers saucily. Shepherding the fox into her room the dragon lets out yet another snort of laughter, 'That's the spirit. Leave them wanting more,' she chortles. 'But don't lose who you are. Being sexy is fun, but don't let it rule your every action.' With that she closes the door, signaling the end of the conversation.";
