Holding her muzzle upwards, the powerful beast kisses and licks at the wolf's face, moaning how lovely she'll look filled with her whelps. The wolf's eyes go wide at this, but she's too overwhelmed by the mix of pain and pleasure from the rough mating to do anything. The dragon creature growls loudly and lustfully as it drives hard into its prey one last time, causing the wolf to yelp then struggle, then become very still.

Given that this is one of the harshest areas in the city, you can imagine the strain that he puts himself under to ensure that his mother and the rest of his family remain safe, though you know that the others occasionally take their turn at guard duty to allow him some time to rest or relax. The door opens before your hand can reach it and the naked frame of Blanche appears in the doorway, your proximity causing her to let out a pleased gasp.

You come to a stop in what you assume is the living area where the other wolves are standing around a table with a heavily-edited city map spread across it. They give you a friendly wag before returning their attention to their mother who takes the prime position to see the map, Sturm shouldering past you to stand beside her and leaving you to stand opposite them with everything upside-down and wondering why he treats you with what feels like passive hostility.";

Maeve seems to believe that they can make do with scavenging only in the Capitol District in order to save their energy and to remain close by should they need help from the rest of their siblings. You reply that while they might spend less time traveling, the creatures around here are more ruthless than many in other areas of the city, Sturm, surprisingly, echoing agreement, adding that the slavers may still be a threat, his appraisal causing the younger wolf to nod his head in acceptance of the logic. Further suggestions of varying plausibility are put forth over time, most of them being countered for one reason or another by Sturm, who seems as zealously protective of all of his siblings as usual, garnering your respect for his loyalty and insight despite his usually surly demeanor towards you.";
	say "     As a lull in the conversation occurs, you suggest that they could try the park. There's clean water, fresh fruit, and not too many areas where creatures might be able to surprise them. On top of that, the infected there are less dangerous than the dragotors and orc slavers that roam the hellscape around their home. Sturm pulls a face as you mention the danger of where they live but grudgingly agrees that the park is likely to be a decent place to scavenge. 'Didn't I tell you that [SubjectPro of Player] would have something to add?' Blanche teasingly asks her eldest son, earning a scowl from the large white wolf. He does however give you a nod of recognition and for the rest of the discussion you don't see him glowering at you at all.";

To your surprise, Sturm does so too. 'You know the city better than I do,' he grudgingly greets you, skipping any pleasantries. You agree, but reply that he seems quite knowledgeable himself and he seems to be doing well protecting his mother. 'Someone should, and you seem to feel that you have better things to do,' he snarls. The white-furred wolf pauses to take a breath before continuing in a more civil tone. 'Mom has so much love in her. We would do anything for her. We all would,' he quickly adds upon noticing one of your eyebrows rise. 'Just make more time to be with her. I may be her favorite child, but she misses you when you are gone.' With that, he stomps away muttering under his breath, leaving you to shake your head and watch the activity around you.";

Noticing his expression, Blanche clips him around the ear with a frown. '[SubjectProCap of Player] hasn't done anything wrong. Why do you bear [ObjectPro of Player] such ill-will?' she softly growls. Looking suitably chastened, the large male wolf greets you. 'Father. We were just readying for our initial scavenging trip to the park. It must be fate that you would appear at the right time,' Sturm explains, unable to keep the sarcasm out of his voice at the end, earning a stern poke in the side from his mother. 'We would be delighted if you had the time to accompany us,' Blanche says brightly, though you notice that she keeps one eye on her eldest son to keep him in check. For all her faults, she seems to hold absolute authority over her family, the incident with the slavers withstanding.";
	say "     Having come here to visit her anyway, you see nothing wrong with escorting them on this little expedition and readily agree to go with them. 'Wonderful. We're all going, so it'll be like a family outing,' she beams before bustling around making sure that everyone has a backpack. While she is distracted, you approach Sturm and remind him that his mother will be safer with you there, a point that he grudgingly concedes. 'You at least have more experience than some of my siblings,' he grumbles. He pauses for a moment before sighing and continuing, 'Mom's right. I shouldn't be so hostile towards you. While you are seldom around, no one else seems to mind and Mom says that you risked your life to save her from an ebonflame drake when you first met. I'll try to be better, but it might take me some time, so be patient please.'

Perhaps due to the size of the group, you are largely left alone by the hostile residents of the city, leaving you free to converse with the wolf MILF. 'Thank you for doing this,' she says, beaming at you in her typically cheerful manner. 'It's a shame that we aren't going to the park merely for a picnic though. Just you, me, and the children sitting on a rug eating sandwiches and drinking lemonade...' You agree that the nanite apocalypse has rather put a dampener on such activities but point out that it did allow you to meet her in the first place. 'That's true, and I wouldn't give up any one of my children for that. They are my greatest treasures.'";
	say "     'But Sturm's your favorite,' Claude says teasingly, nonetheless causing his mother to hurriedly protest that she loves them all equally. You chuckle internally at this exchange, knowing well that it won't be the last time that the accusation is made, though with how much devotion Sturm shows her, even compared to his siblings, you can hardly blame her if she returns his feelings. You just hope that he'll look up to you similarly one day, especially after your earlier conversation. 'They grow up so fast,' Blanche muses as she returns her focus to you, her children still laughing at her expense. You ask whether she had any children before the nanites overwhelmed the city. Giving you a strangely sad look, Blanche replies, 'No. I got pregnant in my last year of high school. But my life went to hell and I ended up miscarrying.' You quickly apologize for bringing up such an awful memory, but she waves you off. 'You weren't to know. I'll tell you more later, but I don't want our children listening in. I haven't even told Sturm.'";

Hopefully you won't have another run in with [ObjectPro of Diego] while you are here. Having reached your destination and seen off the initial threat of the coyote, Blanche has her children gather around to remind them of your objective in the park. 'We're looking for clean water or food that we can easily take back to the den. Do not steal from others and don't exchange [']favors['] for resources. Bianca, Claude, and Maeve, this is mainly directed at you. Don't bother scavenging for building materials this time. It's a long walk back home and food and water are more important. Casper, try to avoid clothes this time, okay?' the wolfess clarifies, her tone brooking no argument. 'Usual pairings.

Sitting down on a bench, she pats for you to sit beside her, an offer which you readily take her up on. This close to her, you can easily smell her natural aroma emanating from her, a mixture of arousal and clean fur.

He kept getting back up each time they knocked him over, each time a little more bloody and bruised until his older sister, Lupa, appeared and beat them up. Even after all that, Wolf still asked if I was alright before being taken to the nurse. Lupa nearly ended up suspended, but she was let off with only a stern warning because she was protecting her brother. They barely left my side at school from then on and Wolf became my childhood sweetheart.'";

As I continued to get good grades at school, they gave me permission to sometimes invite them and my other friends over at weekends to hang out, but I wasn't often allowed to visit them at their own homes. I was kept on a tight leash, if you'll excuse the canine pun. When I was sixteen, Wolf and I began dating properly, or as well as we could with my parents constant interference, and it was one of the happiest periods in my life, especially when Lupa, rather than my parents would chaperone us on our dates as she was amenable to our demonstrations of affection. We did get some strange looks for other people though.'";
		say "     Blanche takes a breath to collect her thoughts, the melancholy expression returning as she picks at a knot in her fur. 'As time went by, I grew attracted to Lupa, though I still had feelings for Wolf. As you can imagine, I was quite torn between the two, but I can't have been that subtle as one day while we were walking home together, they informed me that they were willing to share and that outwardly I could continue to date Wolf but in private I could be with either or both. If I wanted to explore my sexuality, this seemed a fool-proof plan, especially as being a lesbian or bisexual was treated even worse than it is today. Or at least before where I worked became surrounded by lava,' she jokes, trying to cheer herself up. 'At first I was scared of this. Would it make me a slut? But over time I warmed up to the idea of being in a three-way relationship. If it made me happy, why should I care? Eventually I summoned the courage to agree to their proposal and we began to fool around from time to time.'";

		say "     'Most of the time this had to be done at their house so that we weren't caught. Their father was in the military and frequently on deployment, but when he was home nearly all of his time was spent with Wolf and Lupa, whether it was playing games with them, taking them out for hikes in the forests, or reading them bedtime stories. He was a little gruff at times, but he loved his children in a way that my parents lacked. I'd have traded all the privileges that I grew up with to have had a father like him. Their mother was the manager of a supermarket and always seemed to be exhausted. It wasn't uncommon to see her spend the evening watching television while struggling not to doze off. I wonder now how much of a strain it was for her to raise two children alone with such success. I didn't give her enough credit at the time. Just between you and me, I have enough trouble with mine, and they grow up a lot faster.";
		say "     'In my final year of high school there was one night that, curious as to what it would feel like, I asked Wolf not to pull out when he came. It was a stupid thing to do in hindsight, but at the time it felt exciting and I can hardly blame him for agreeing despite Lupa's protestations. Her fears came true and I discovered that I was pregnant a few weeks later. I still had several months of school left so of course I was unmarried and there was no way that I would be able to conceal it from my classmates, teachers, or even worse, my parents. I would become a social pariah and my parents['] reputation would be ruined. Unsure what to do, I made what may have ended up being the worst decision in my life. Accompanied by Wolf and Lupa, I asked my parents for help. Parents are meant to love and protect you no matter what. Mine did not.'";

'My mother wouldn't stop crying, only pausing every now and then to scream that I was a harlot or a whore before crying some more. My father initially just stood there, his anger building up until he couldn't contain it any more. The rest is mostly a blur, but I remember Wolf putting himself between my father and me, everyone shouting, my mother clawing at Lupa's face, and the sound of glass breaking as Wolf fell on a table. I don't remember much after that other than being put in an ambulance while my parents were escorted away by police officers. Their money and standing wouldn't protect them from what they had done.'";

I didn't get to testify against my parents, the prosecution had enough evidence without involving me, though maybe they talked to me and I just don't remember. I was taken to live with an aunt on the east coast so I never saw Wolf and Lupa again, but I was told that they would recover in time despite their injuries. My aunt was cold towards me, but I managed to graduate high school before she told me that I had to make a life of my own and that she hoped that she would never see me again. My life since then has been fairly uneventful, even college is a blur, but that's effectively how I ended up here.'

'Oh my! Look how well you've done. Maybe we'll have to come here again in future. Once Sturm gets back, we can return home and Mommy will see what she can cook up as a reward,' she praises them, patting a few on the head while the others are kissed on the nose. 'Wait. Who are those people?' Blanche worriedly says, shepherding her children behind her as a group of four hermaphroditic wolf-human hybrids with painted markings approach.

Get on all fours and prepare to be mounted!' Despite this threat, Blanche remains unimpressed, Penelope and Wendis looming over her shoulder. 'So no-one has actually stolen anything, you're just being selfish? Not the sort of lesson I want my children to learn from,' she grumbles[if Perception of Player > 15]. You notice Sturm sneaking up on the group, murder in his eyes, Bianca a few steps behind him[end if]. The leader of the Painted Wolves holds up their hand to silence the discontent from their group before speaking again. 'All of these are yours? You must be very fertile. You would make an excellent breeding bitch for the tribe and would be very well cared for. Our numbers would swell massively.

'We will hunt you down,' the hybrid leader growls before Sturm strikes him in the jaw, knocking him out. Leaving them unconscious where they lie on the ground, you join in the affectionate reunion between them all, even managing to get a quick hug from Sturm who murmurs, 'Thank you for protecting her,' in your ear.

I don't know how we are going to keep up scavenging when we'll need even more people on lookout too.' You remind her of your offer that she and her children could move into the library with you where it is safer and if worse comes to worst, they can escape a lot more easily than they would here but before Blanche can answer, Sturm cuts in.

It looks very warm and well-cared for.' 'Checking my mother out are you?' Sturm teases, though you detect an edge to the question. Sonny begins to splutter an excuse (including that Sturm looked just as good), but Blanche soon comes to his rescue. 'Behave yourself Sturm. He was complimenting you as much as me on the effort that goes into fur-care. You need to work on being more approachable, dear.' Sturm grumbles an apology, which the sheep clumsily accepts before retreating again. Not exactly the best first impression, but it could have been worse.

I don't need to be hugged,' Spike replies almost petulantly, though you notice how he shifts his posture to hide his stirring sheath from the wolves. Perhaps in an attempt to console him, Sturm steps forth with his hand outstretched, the Doberman gladly clasping it in return. 'To answer your question, yes, we are moving in. Our previous home wasn't safe any more. I'm Sturm and this is my mother, Blanche. Don't worry about her hugging you, she does it to anyone that she likes. It happens to me multiple times a day,' he says with a grin. 'My mom hardly ever hugs me...' you hear Spike mutter before he begins to eagerly ask Sturm questions about his life in the city, the larger wolf answering cheerfully while Blanche looks on with an adoring smile.

You hadn't realized just how large Sturm was, but when he and an orc square of against each other, you notice that they are about the same size, the two circling around and snarling before lunging for each other. Bianca by comparison looks a little more out of her depth, a look of relief crossing her face as you aid her in staring down her adversary, Sturm giving you a nod of gratitude when he manages to knock the orc back a few steps.

Perhaps fueled by adrenaline, Ernest swings his scavenging-bag with all his might into the noggin of the unprepared orc with a metallic crunch.

I think that it is a competition between Sturm, Penelope, Lumi and myself for who is the most capable combatant. I'm the strongest but I tire the fastest.

Giving his mother a hug and you a curt nod, Sturm slips outside to take up guard duty, leaving you to decide what to do next, now that the hullabaloo is over.";

'It's been years. I haven't done much with my life since then, but what did you do? I'm assuming that you haven't been a wolf all this time,' Blanche asks, a wet snort suggesting that she had tried to laugh but that a sob had occurred simultaneously.

Had a girlfriend.' He once again pauses, waiting for Blanche's reaction. 'I'm pleased for you. You had no way of knowing that we would see each other again. You were no longer mine...' she reassures him sadly. 'Joined army like my father. Found out girlfriend pregnant. Daughter born while away. Missed much of her life,' Fang laments, the pain of being absent from a child's life something that Blanche can only imagine, the white wolf sympathetically kissing him on the nose but otherwise remains quiet so as to allow him to continue.";

Even from family. Girlfriend left with daughter. Not long before city changed. Hurt me deeply. Don't blame her. Was not good father. Not around enough. She deserved better. Don't know where they are. Hopefully not here. Am hopefully better person now.' Unable to keep quiet any longer, Blanche squeezes Fang tightly and soothingly murmurs, 'Don't blame yourself too much either. I can only begin to imagine how you've suffered since that night, and that sort of trauma isn't going to go away just through sheer willpower. Just know that I'm here for you now should I be able to help you come to terms with it.'

Got us all hurt,' Fang begins before the white wolf shushes him. 'I'm more to blame than you are. I asked you to finish inside me. I involved my parents. It was my parents that hurt you both. I'll give you the same advice that my therapist gave me, though I seem to have mostly ignored it myself. Accept what has happened and move forward with how to make up for it. Both towards yourself and others. I'm not sure that I will ever forgive my parents, but I've never blamed either you or Lupa for any of it. Neither should you. My time with you two was one of the best periods in my life. You're likely still as obstinate now as you used to be, but trust me on this. What happened wasn't your fault. Did Lupa actually blame you, or do you just assume that she does?' Blanche gently scolds him.";

'After that, I went to live with an aunt in New York and finish high school. She and my uncle blamed me for it all and made sure that I knew it, but my cousins were a lot more supportive. I don't know whether I would have been able to manage without them. After that I went off to college and grad-school. Thinking about it, I probably studied the similar things to [if Fang is Male]Lupa[else]you[end if], specializing in entrepreneurship and project management, though I put in more than a little extra effort to do some non-related papers too to give myself a wider understanding of the world. I had a few people that I was friends with, but no boyfriend or girlfriend, and none of them kept in contact when we graduated. Too much time trying to learn, not enough time having fun with them, I guess.'";

I had difficulty deciding whose offer to accept until the owner of a chain of retail stores took me out to lunch to offer me a job. I thought that anyone who took the time to meet prospective employees personally would be decent to work for, especially when the salary offered was so high for a first job. I'd only been there about a month, learning the finer points of the business from a senior employee, when the CEO's son began making advances on me and I found myself transferred to being his personal assistant. Long story short, it didn't take long before he tried to grope me. I made an official complaint. Perhaps I was naive, but I was shocked when instead of disciplining him, I was instead accused of insubordination and fired. I should have hired a lawyer, but I was sure that I wouldn't win anyway and that I'd be employed again soon enough. In hindsight, I don't think that insubordination is valid grounds for being fired, but at the time I was too upset to think it through.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Blanche pauses for a moment, catching her breath and snuggling with the wolf on her lap, before continuing her story. 'It turned out that it wasn't as easy as that. All the companies that had previously seemed eager to have me join them suddenly didn't want anything to do with me. I had some money of my own, but not doing anything just felt... wrong. I would have donated my organs to science before talking to my parents again, so in the end I decided that I needed a change of scenery. I came here and eventually was able to get a job at a company that was developing something to do with water filtration. I was merely an office drone, and so was vastly over-qualified, but it was something to do. Ultimately, it ended up being an alright decision. It wasn't the most thrilling of work and the boss didn't like me much, but I was never threatened with being fired and no one made any sexual advances on me. The best thing was that I my work colleagues were friendly and they would invite me out to coffee or to join them at the park.'";

'I worked there until the city changed, but just before that, the business and all the research was bought by some foreign tech company. Archetech, I think it was called. Surprisingly, at least to me, they wanted to keep everyone employed, office staff included, though my boss decided that he was going to retire. I even met the founder and his wife while they were finalizing the deal, though I can't remember their names. They were friendly enough and one of my colleagues mentioned that with my qualifications, that I would be an excellent replacement as the new manager. I would finally have been able to see what I was capable of, but then while we were working late, the emergency broadcast that was the first sign of the crisis happened. The ground split open in the Capitol District, everyone else desperately tried to get home, and I was left alone taking shelter in the office while the ground shook and the district burned.'";

	say "     'Part of me thought that I was being punished for being happy, just as I had been with you and [if Fang is Female]Wolf[else]Lupa[end if], so all that I could think about was when we were young and the three of us were together, then the supply cabinet fell on me. I'm not sure how I survived, but when I woke up I was like this. It is slightly amusing that you ended up a dark-furred wolf while I ended up a white one, but I can't say that I'm disappointed. Eventually, I ran out of food from the breakroom and had to go out scavenging. I remembered what your father had taught us when we were little, but that didn't factor in dragons climbing out of lava vents and trying to rape you. If it hadn't been for [if player is not defaultnamed][Name of Player][else]our anonymous benefactor[end if], I wouldn't have ever met you again. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to start a family, all of whom I love dearly. I'm sure that they would love to meet you, though I will first have to tell them about my past. That is unless they have overheard me at some point. I wouldn't put it past them.'";
	say "     'Sorry if that was long-winded, especially compared to your concise explanation, but it is such a relief to be with you again. I think that I just wanted to remember what it was like to talk to you,' Blanche apologizes to Fang, who promptly shakes [PosAdj of Fang] head. 'I enjoyed it. Can't talk well anyway,' [SubjectPro of Fang] replies. 'Together again.' 'You'll have to tell me about what has happened to you since you became a wolf, though perhaps another time[if HP of Lux > 0]. I would also love to hear about your delightful children[end if],' Blanche murmurs before settling down to nap on top of her childhood sweetheart, the tension melting from her body as she drifts off. Once [SubjectPro of Fang] is sure that she is asleep, Fang looks over at you and gives you a meaningful look.

We can come back again soon, but I have something planned that you might enjoy,' the wolf matriarch consoles her. 'I'd give you a piggy-back, but you're a bit big. And an adult. Alas, such treats are only for Wendis now, I think.' Your short journey to your rendezvous is filled by your children's enthusiasm for some of the shops that they have been in, many that you can't say that you've seen yourself. The conversation comes to an end when you enter the food court and the two of them rush over to where Sturm is seated with the rest of his siblings at a few tables that have been pulled together, you and Blanche approaching at a more dignified pace.";
	say "     As you sit down, you are surprised to see that there is a selection of food on the table in front of you. Noodles, soup, and fries to name a few. 'Courtesy of some of my new friends,' Claude laughs upon seeing your surprised expression. 'I don't know how you do it, but it is certainly appreciated. Perhaps you can teach me.' Bernard says as he joins in, ruffling the wolf-of-the-hour's fur. Claude merely smiles, keeping his secret to himself, though he does briefly blush when his mother kisses him on the cheek and praises him. 'Such a good boy.' As you all eat, your children discuss what they have been doing for the last hour, the novelty of the mall seemingly greatly appreciated by them, especially when compared to scavenging. However, the meal is interrupted by the arrival of three wolverine's led by [if PlayerMet of Jenna is True]Jenna[else]a female with [']BOSS['] in large letters on her vest[end if]. 'Sorry to interrupt, but could I speak with the two of you?' she asks, indicating you and Blanche. 'Don't worry. You're not in trouble.'";

	say "     Intrigued, you both follow her over to the relative privacy of the entrance of a closed café, the children still in view but likely out of earshot given the activity of the foodcourt. 'What seems to be the problem officer,' Blanche asks. 'Technically it's not [']officer[']. Not any more. You may call me Jenna and I'm head of security here[if PlayerMet of Jenna is True]. Your partner has met me before, but I suppose I didn't give [ObjectPro of Player] the chance to tell you that[end if],' the wolverine replies. 'Anyway, from your lack of embarrassment, I'm assuming that you all usually forgo clothes, so I won't worry about that. Are you intending to move into the mall?' 'No. We have made living arrangements elsewhere. I brought my children to see Santa Claws, though it's a surprise. I was here not long ago arranging it with him, but you may have missed seeing me then,' the wolfess replies.";
	say "     'Well, that answers the next question, though I have to say, I don't know how you keep your sanity with that many children, literal or figurative. There are a few people here that seem to struggle with fewer, though given that we haven't had any complaints about them, they must be very well behaved,' Jenna says with barely contained astonishment. 'They're my pride and joy,' Blanche replies sincerely. 'I think that that is all I had to say. Enjoy the rest of your time in the mall and I hope that you'll visit again,' the wolverine says before striding away again with her guards following behind. Your children look at you curiously as you return, but their mother explains that Jenna merely wanted to discover whether they were refugees or just visitors. The rest of the meal goes by without mishap.";

	say "     'Now for the main reason why we came,' Blanche declares as everyone finishes up, stacking their trays and brushing stray food from their fur. 'I thought that you should get the chance to experience the joy of Christmas. Though it is meant to be on the 25th of December, I haven't kept track of the date. Fortunately, the Christmas village in the east wing of the mall seems to always be present (if you'll excuse the pun), so if you can still move after such a feast, I thought that we might go there and you can experience one of its traditions. Receiving presents.' A buzz of excitement spreads among the white wolves as they follow you and their mother towards your destination, though there is some confusion over them not having bought gifts for anyone. 'I didn't expect you to. I already sorted everything. Do you not remember my sudden disappearance recently?' Blanche teases. Realization crosses the faces of many of her children, while others nod as though their suspicions have been confirmed.";
	say "     'Sturm thought that you had been kidnapped,' Wendis giggles before Penelope manages to clamp a paw over her mouth. Your son scowls but otherwise contains his annoyance at his younger sister's impetuousness. 'I was worried. That's all,' her grumbles, ears flattened against his head. 'Darling... Hopefully your present will make up a little for that, but I can give you extra cuddles later too,' Blanche consoles him, his tail wagging excitedly at the thought. Soon you arrive at the Christmas village, snow drifting down from above and diminutive figures hurrying around. In front of you sits [if PlayerMet of Santa Claws is True]Santa Claws in all his glory [else]a polar bear dressed as Father Christmas [end if]on a large wooden throne. There is a small line of people in front of him, but as you join the queue you doubt that you will have to wait long, a theory that proves correct. 'Ah. You have returned madam,' he greets Blanche warmly before letting his gaze fall on each of her children individually. 'My goodness. So many bundles of joy. I am Santa Claws. Come. Allow me to spread the Christmas cheer with you,' he booms, inviting any one of them to step forward.";

'It is the custom, yes, but you don't have to if you don't want to. Rest assured, I won't try anything funny,' Santa Claws replies. With a shrug, your son sits on his wide lap while the bear fishes in a large sack of presents. 'Sturm was it? Your mother tells me that you have been very good this year. Caring for your family and sparing no effort in their protection. I hope that this will help you find some calm in these times of chaos.' Blanche's eldest son is given a blue-and-white-striped gift which he promptly tears into. He gasps as the paper falls away and reveals a carved wooden box with inlaid black an white marble squares. 'A chess set?' he half states, half asks, looking towards his mother. She smiles and nods, gasping as he leaps off Santa's lap and hugs her tightly. 'I'm guessing that you like it,' Blanche says, her voice muffled by her son's fluffy shoulder.";
	say "     Next, Bianca approaches the bear, wriggling her backside on his lap in order to get comfortable. 'You must be Bianca. I get the feeling that you have a tendency for naughtiness, but not in the [']Naughty and Nice['] way, so I don't need to give you coal or a visit from Krampus. You should be able to have quite a bit of fun with this,' Santa chuckles before passing her a purple and white polka-dotted present. Your daughter excitedly rips it open to find a compact video camera, brand new and still in the box. 'Don't get up to too much mischief with it,' Blanche teases her before Bianca copies her brother and cuddles her mother. 'I make no promises,' you hear her reply. 'You could do a documentary on the city,' Wendis suggests. 'I think that that would probably end up being a R-rated film anyway,' Penelope sighs. You have to agree, even if Bianca was less of a deviant, the city's occupants were more than a little sex-obsessed.";

You have an almost child-like wonder when it comes to the sciences, with a willingness to benefit others with it to match. Perhaps with this, you can use what you know to fulfill your dreams or make something new,' the bear says, hefting a red and white checkered present onto the floor in front of him. Ernest slides from his lap and carefully unwraps it, a grin spreading across his muzzle as he sees the tool box hidden within. He opens and closes draws and lids, his eyes sparkling almost maniacally at the thought of what he could do. 'I'm not sure that I'll be able to lift this, but... wow,' he says, words failing him at the end. 'I'm sure we'll manage between us,' Blanche replies, kneeling down and kissing him on the top of the head. 'Bernard, Penelope, or I could carry it for you,' Sturm volunteers, the other two nodding their agreement.";

Perhaps this will help you make even more friends,' Santa Claws chortles as a pair of elves deposit a large box wrapped in yellow-and-white diamond paper. Your son pats them on the head before tearing through the paper with gusto, momentarily surprised when all he finds is a cardboard box. However, when he opens the lid, his tail begins to wag rapidly and a sly grin forms on his face. You approach to see candles, body oil, and towels, along with a small book on how to perform massages. 'You probably won't want to use the oil on anyone with fur, but knowing you, it won't just be family that you share your talents with,' Blanche explains as Claude leaps into a cuddle. 'I'm sure that I won't be the only willing volunteer for you to practice on either.'";

'Your mother tells me that you have an interest that most wouldn't suspect of someone as robust as you,' Santa whispers conspiratorially, making her blush. The polar bear passes her a large present, covered in white wrapping paper with pink snowflakes. 'Go ahead. Your mother shouldn't be the only one to know.' Penelope meticulously removes the tape without ripping the paper to reveal four small aloe vera plants in a cardboard box. All of her siblings look suitably surprised, even Wendis and Ernest. Blanche by comparison looks smug. 'I thought that it might be better if you had more than one, just in case something happens to them,' she explains, dwarfed as her daughter crushes her in a hug. 'I shall treat them with the same care that you have treated us,' Penelope replies. 'Just what else are you hiding beneath all that fluff?' Wendis asks her accusingly, seemingly more than a little annoyed that her sister kept this interest secret from her.";
	say "     When she doesn't get an answer, Blanche's smallest daughter clambers onto Santa's knee, actually looking like she fits there. Sort of. 'How much of your being do you put towards bringing joy to others? Are you sure that you wouldn't like to work here with me? I think that it might suit you,' the bear asks, chuckling when she determinedly shakes her head. 'Perhaps one day. Until then, this may help you show the brightness of your soul to others.' Santa Claws passes her a present with wrapping paper inverse of her litter-mate, pink with white snowflakes. Wendis squeals excitedly as she rips the paper away to find several pieces of wood, some paper, and and assortment of paint tubes. 'It's for an easel, darling,' Blanche explains when she confusedly holds up a wooden rod. 'Thank you Mommy,' Wendis sincerely tells her mother as she snuggles up against her before turning back to the bear and hugging one of his legs. 'Thank you Santa.' The polar bear smiles and pats her on the head. 'My pleasure. I think that you know full well how fulfilling it is to bring happiness to others.'";

Bernard looks at his family before back at the polar bear and shaking his head. 'You really are a close-knit family. Perhaps you can reinforce the bonds even further with this,' Santa proclaims, lifting a green and white mottled present from the sack beside him. Your son neatly tears one end open and pulls the box inside into view, inhaling sharply when he sees the picture of a portable gas cooker. 'Food is one of the quickest ways to someone's heart,' Blanche says warmly. 'Along with between the fourth and fifth ribs,' you hear Sturm mumble, making Ernest chuckle a little bit. 'No more microwave cooking,' Bernard excitedly replies before following in the footsteps of his siblings and hugging his mother. 'You really do have quite the powerful scent. Are you washing enough? Sorry, that was rude,' Blanche responds.";
	say "     Maeve excitedly takes her place on Santa's knee, the anticipation of what thoughtful gift she might receive making her wriggle. 'You're a troublemaker, aren't you?' the polar bear says, a corner of his mouth twitching up in a smile. 'Yes,' your daughter replies, the simple response causing Santa Claws to burst into laughter again. 'Such directness! Are you or are you not Maeve?' he asks after he catches his breath. 'Assuming that you are, I think that this might be more suited to your more nuanced side.' Maeve is handed a box with purple and white swirled wrapping-paper. Without hesitation, she rips the paper from it, her eyebrows knotting when all she sees is a plain black briefcase. 'Open it sweetie,' Blanche suggests. The way Maeve's eyes sparkle when she sees the contents could send shivers down an orc's spine. 'A magic set,' she almost purrs before snapping the case shut again. It would seem that she isn't going to share any more information, a magician's discretion subduing her usually talkative nature, though she does go over to cuddle her mother to demonstrate her gratitude.";

I've heard quite a bit about your tracking skills and how amazing your nose is. It reminds me of a certain someone,' the bear muses, scratching her between the ears. 'Your mother assures me that you'll enjoy your present, so here you go...' He looks a little skeptical, but nonetheless hands her what looks like a bag wrapped in white paper with green trees in neat rows on it. Like a savage beast, your daughter rips through the paper to come face to face with an open sports bag, assorted balls within, though some seem to need inflating. If you thought that the others looked pleased by their presents, Lumi looks outright ecstatic. She leaps off Santa's knee and bounds around her mother excitedly, eventually standing on two legs to lick her face while being hugged. 'Fascinating. You really know your children,' the polar bear concedes to Blanche.";
	say "     Casper approaches Santa Claws much more calmly than his sister before him. As he sits down, he seems to be admiring the polar bear's costume, even going so far as to more closely examine the buttons. 'Your mother tells me that you have an appreciation for clothes, costumes, and cosplay, down to the finest detail,' the ursine comments after your son has sated his curiosity. 'Perhaps these might help you.' Instead of reaching into his bag, Santa gestures for what look like two people to be brought forward, each wrapped in white paper with pictures of Father Christmas across it. Carefully slicing the paper open with a claw, Casper reveals the alabaster-white humanoid mannequins beneath, one [']male['] and one [']female['], though seeming quite inanimate. 'I hadn't managed to find any while scavenging. Thank you Mom,' he says, briefly pulling himself away from admiring his gift to hug his mother. 'It wasn't easy for me to find them either. The person I acquired them from took some persuading to part with them,' Blanche replies.";

The wolfess looks at you before apologizing, 'I'm sorry. I sort of fixated on my children and forgot that I had something for you as well.' A nearby elf passes her a small present tied up with a little bow, which she then hands to you. 'Merry Christmas lover mine,' the wolf MILF tenderly says, kissing you on the cheek. You pull the ribbon and the paper parts to reveal five dice in a plastic case. Upon closer inspection, you see that three of the dice have words on instead of dots, the visible faces reading, [']Rub My['], [']Face['], and [']On Floor[']. 'I thought that it might be fun to play at some point,' Blanche whispers coquettishly in your ear, making you shiver[if IncestList is not warded and IncestList is not banned].

She first looks at you then her children, but you all shake your heads, leaving her confused. 'Who is it from?' she eventually asks the bear. 'He came by just after you did last time, but I don't know his name. The strange thing is that he looked human, though it wasn't easy to tell with him wearing a large coat and with half of his face obscured by bandages. He gave me this package and insisted that I give it to you. I don't think he bore you any ill will, quite the opposite, but he seemed hesitant to give it to you himself when I asked,' Santa Claws explains, passing a shabby-looking brown parcel to Blanche 'A word of warning though. He had a weird aura, maybe stranger than Nermine's.' You all crowd around as she carefully opens it, delicately detaching the tape without ripping the paper. Inside is a battered wooden box, and a card.";

Though we only met briefly, the high regard with which your colleagues hold you suggests that you would be an excellent choice for a promotion.

If you'll permit me to try to incentivise you, please enjoy the assortment of tea that Kiko selected for you. If the date is inconvenient, please contact me on the phone-number provided when we met the other day. I look forward to meeting you properly. Yours sincerely, Hannibal T.' Blanche takes a moment to breathe, moisture beading at the corner of her eye. 'The number of people lost...' she mumbles. 'Wait. I think a piece of paper fell out,' Casper interrupts, stooping to pick something off the floor before passing it to his mother.";

The whole situation is weird, with no-one entirely sure how to feel about it. Surprisingly, Santa Claws is the one to eventually break the silence. 'Well, it seems to have a happy ending. Sort of. For now, I suggest you continue spending time with your children, especially when they have their gifts to try out.' His jolly demeanor snaps everyone out of their slump, returning to them their excitement at experiencing their first (sort of) Christmas. Though Blanche still seems a little contemplative, everyone else seems eager to return to the library and properly enjoy their presents. Shaking her head, the white wolf matriarch dispels her thoughts, thanking the polar bear once again, before directing her attention back to her children.";

However, just as you're about to leave the food court, the wolfess spots [if PlayerMet of Danny is True]Danny [else]a rat with a camera [end if]standing by the wall and brings your group to a halt. 'Would anyone mind if I got a picture of us all together?' she says almost pleadingly. Her tone seems to have been unnecessary, as her children seem just as enthused by the idea as she is. Blanche catches the attention of the photographer as she approaches and after a quick exchange persuades him to take a photo of the entire family. He invites you into a nearby shop where he has everyone deposit their presents to the side before directing you all to stand in front of a wall painted to look like a forest. After a few moments of adjusting placements and posture, [if PlayerMet of Danny is True]Danny [else]the rat [end if] takes a few steps back and raises his camera.

As you exit the mall, Bianca approaches with a look of concern. 'How did you afford all of this Mommy? I hope that you didn't have to trade your body,' she asks, a few of her siblings mumbling agreement. To their surprise, Blanche starts to laugh. 'Oh, nothing like that. I had a lock box with some money in it from before this whole mess and not everyone trades in food, water, and those silly Zephyr coins. Anyway, they weren't from me, they were from Santa,' she adds with a wink.

Accustomed to Blanche's many children rushing this way and that, finding the entrance hall completely empty of them distinctly strange. Worried that something may have happened to the wolf matriarch, you hurry towards where her makeshift den is in the computer room, your fear easing slightly upon finding Bianca calmly reading through the manual for her video camera. Quickly questioning her as to the whereabouts of her mother, she tells you that Sturm had found a place that might be able to be used by your progeny should the library become overpopulated and that Blanche had gone with him. Due to this find, her other brothers and sisters has gone off in the hopes of finding similar places, eager for more of their mother's approval. After getting directions where to go and finding that it is only a few minutes away, you leave the library again and weave down an alleyway a little way down the street to find a non-descript house nestled behind all the other buildings.";

The exterior isn't anything special, concrete with only a few grimy windows, and the inside isn't much better, shattered shelves and empty food wrappers stirring around as you pass by. However, it isn't the house that is of interest you, but the cellar access that Blanche's daughter told you is accessed from the garden. Down the side of the house, you find a hatch open and you descend the stairs, soon finding yourself in a small, tidy room lit up by a naked bulb on the ceiling, the rumble of a generator audible behind a steel door to your left. Going through the other door ahead of you, you enter a thinly carpeted living room, a few wooden chairs and even a sofa pushed against one of the walls opposite a table with an old radio. You wonder to yourself if this was some sort of budget bunker, a storm shelter, or just the result of someone converting their cellar into another part of the house. Your musings are interrupted by the sound of laughter on the other side of the door in front of you. Curious as to what is happening, you open the door a crack and look through, the sight on the other side quite the surprise.";

Rolling around in a playful attempt to escape, the white wolf matriarch giggles hysterically as her son teases her, neither of them seemingly aware of their growing arousal. You are unsure how much of this is influenced by the nanites, but you know for sure that your son has always had feelings for his mother. Eventually, Sturm relents and allows his mother to catch her breath, collapsing on the bed beside her. Panting and gazing into each other's eyes, you can see the raw affection that they have towards each other and perhaps a little more.

Blanche lies there, her heavy breathing being emphasized by the rise and fall of her full breasts. You notice Sturm's eyes being drawn to them, a struggle going on behind his eyes before he rolls onto his front, his legs straddling his mother's thigh. 'What are you doing darling,' Blanche laughs without lifting her head, stroking a hand down her son's side. He doesn't answer, instead pressing his face into her bosom, sending a shiver through her body, nuzzling against her before his mouth finds its way to one of her swollen black nipples and begins to suckle. 'Sturm, dear, don't you think that you're a bit old to be nursing? Though it does feel good...' While initially one of Blanche's hands had been moving to pull Sturm's head away, it soon falls to her side as she lies there and allows him to breastfeed, sighing contentedly as he swallows her abundant milk.";

Eventually however, he releases her nipple from between his lips with a pop, a small trickle of milk dribbling from the corner of his mouth, and carefully disentangles himself from her arms and shuffles down to the foot of the bed. Blanche seems to hold her breath, unable to speak as her son caresses the fur of her thighs down to her knees before gently parting them. Willing or obliging, ultimately it doesn't matter, the wolf matriarch allows her legs to fall open to reveal her puffy canine spade, a steady flow of arousal leaking from it and soaking into the covers beneath her. 'Sturm, darling... We should probably stop. This isn't something normally done between a mother and her children, or any family members for that matter.

He waits, his tongue hovering by her pussy and he looks her in the eyes, waiting for her reaction. As she looks past her heaving chest into her son's earnest gaze, she notices that the door is ajar and that there is a shadow of someone watching the two of them. Her nose quivers as she stares at you, a look of recognition briefly flashing across her face before, after a few seconds without intervention, she takes a deep breath and returns her attention to her son. 'I love you too Sturm. Show me what a man my favorite son have grown to be.' Blanche delivers this statement with unadulterated love, her voice soon giving way to gasps as the male wolf drives his tongue into her cunt.";

The position doesn't seem to cause Blanche any discomfort, in fact she seems to be enjoying this treatment immensely, humping her hips against his roving tongue as best as she can and rubbing her clit against his nose, the texture further stimulating her. 'Ooohhh sweetie, you're making Mommy feel really good,' she moans, trapping the sheets beneath her in her clenched fists. Her son doesn't relent, in fact increasing the vigor with which he eats her out, but you see his tail wagging at the praise, making you smile at such an innocent response in such a perverse situation. Caressing his hands up his mother's thighs, Sturm cups her buttocks and pulls her groin against his face, kneading the soft globes as he does so. With her legs released, Blanche wraps them around her partner's head trapping his face against her pussy, not that he seems to mind this display of the pleasure that he is eliciting from her.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Soon enough, it becomes all too much for Blanche to handle and she climaxes, spraying Sturm's face with her fem-cum while her legs rhythmically clench around his head. You can imagine her pussy contracting and releasing around his tongue, desperately trying to pull it in further. When his mother's legs eventually fall slack and Sturm draws his face away you can see how soaked with her juices it has become, the potent-smelling fluid seeping into his fur even as he runs his tongue around his muzzle. Giggling at the state of her son, Blanche sits up and pulls him into her lap before washing his face herself, licking him until his fur has been cleaned of all that hasn't already been absorbed by the snow-white fluff. 'Does this mean that I've marked you as mine?' she teases him before lovingly meeting his lips in a kiss. 'I've always been yours,' Sturm replies with a smile when they part. 'It was pretty hot seeing you licking up your own juices though,' he adds, making his mother laugh again.";
				say "     'Let's hope that your other parent agrees. You can come in now dear,' Blanche responds, beckoning you in with a paw. Sturm looks a little startled when you enter the room, looking between you and his mother. 'Did you enjoy the show?' she asks, her smile widening when you simply nod. Your son doesn't seem to know what to do, his usual confidence momentarily absent as he looks back and forth between you and his mother. 'Does... does this mean we can do more?' he eventually asks, his tail wagging hopefully. 'Of course you can,' Blanche replies, one paw slipping down to cup her son's balls, making his erection bob up and down. 'It wouldn't be fair if you didn't get some attention too. How did you want to do this?' Sturm ponders the question for but a moment before replying, 'I want to make love to you. [BlancheMomDadTitle] can join in too if [SubjectPro of Player] wants, but I want to be the one breeding you.' You reassure him that you'll grant him this request, a warm fuzzy feeling filling you at the look of gratitude that he directs at you.";

You don't know whether he is pleased that he is going to be the sole recipient of her affections or if he is disappointed that you won't be joining him, but any thought of this is soon brushed aside as Blanche pulls him back down on top of her and kisses him deeply, no doubt the flavor of her own pussy still on his tongue. You watch the sticky path his leaking cock leaves on her fur as it throbs and rubs its way over her thigh until eventually their lips part, passion smoldering in their eyes. The wolfess squeals playfully as Sturm grabs her and rolls over on the bed so that he is on his back with her atop him before he shuffles up the bed until his back is up against the head-board. Now with his mother in his lap and his penis trapped between their bodies, your son is ready to claim his prize.";
					say "     Grasping Blanche's backside, Sturm lifts her up while at the same time spreading her buttocks, revealing her flexing sphincter and drooling pussy as he aligns himself for penetration. Supporting herself on her knees, the wolfess leans forward and kisses her son deeply while the two of them gaze into each others eyes. Perhaps deferring to his mother's superior experience, Sturm waits for his mother to impale herself on his penis, a whine slipping out as as she teases him, brushing her slick cunt over the crown of his cock back and forth. Eventually Blanche can't hold herself back any longer and steadily sinks her son's shaft into the warm embrace of her depths, allowing him to savor the loss of his virginity. She doesn't stop her descent until her puffy lips are spread around the base of Sturm's penis, her son's head tilted back as he revels in the clenching of her vaginal walls around his length, his hand idly squeezing the flesh of his mother's backside.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Giving Sturm a moment to enjoy the new sensation, Blanche caresses a hand down the side of his face before allowing it to trail over the muscles of his body. 'You really are attractive. I don't know why I didn't make a move on you sooner,' she murmurs to herself. Though Sturm doesn't reply, he seems to be ready to resume their coupling, bringing one paw up to briefly cup one of his mother's breasts before clasping either side of her waist. At his urging, Blanche begins to slowly rise and fall on his lap, the sedate speed allowing them to continue exploring each other's bodies with a level of intimacy seldom seen in the city. Blanche licks Sturm's muzzle, he nuzzles into the fluff of her neck. One of Sturm's fingers probes between his mother's buttocks, she flicks one of his nipples. Each experimenting to see what the other likes and what really arouses either of them.";
					say "     As their arousal mounts, their passion increases and the exploring gives way to a more desperate need, Sturm firmly pulling his mother down to meet his thrusts while she grasps his shoulders for support. Both unashamedly express their pleasure through grunting, moaning, and growling. The wet slap of Sturm's growing knot colliding with his mother's canine vulva fills the room and you can smell their combined scent, potent and enticing. At one point, Blanche tips her head back to expose her throat and her son grasps the side of it between his teeth, causing her to let out an almost primal moan. 'I'm not sure how much longer I can last. You're really making Mommy feel good. I can't wait to feel your knot filling me and your seed flooding my womb,' the wolfess gasps. Hearing this, Sturm redoubles his efforts, hammering upwards into his mother while her breasts bounce and her tongue lolls out of the side of her mouth in ecstasy, her usual dignity having left her. You swear that you can see the bulge of your son's penis each time he thrusts into his devoted mother.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     'M-mom. I'm about to...' Sturm grunts, kneading his mother's ass cheeks as he struggles to force his knot into her, his inexperience having led him to leave it later than he should have. A closer look reveals how distended Blanche's vulva is becoming as the two of them valiantly attempt to tie, the MILF's eyes losing focus and a drawn out moan escapes her throat. The constant stimulation of this effort soon causes Sturm to climax, his scrotum beginning to pulse as he finally locks his cock inside his mother's pussy. Somehow having held it back until now, Blanche joins her son in orgasm, shaky breathes accompanying each squeeze of her cunt around the throbbing organ inside of her. Caught in the moment, the two passionately embrace, shuddering together as their intimacy reaches a new level. Though he remains tied with his mother, Sturm turns to you. 'This is one of the best feelings that I've had in my life. Perhaps at some point you and I could try this too?' he asks, causing Blanche to beam.";
					say "     'That's the sort of family bonding that I like to see. Well, maybe I wasn't thinking of it to that extent, but I can definitely understand the appeal now,' she says cheerfully. 'I apologize if you had something to discuss with me, but unless it is urgent, would you mind letting me enjoy this last bit of quality time together with our son a bit more?' Assenting to her wish, you muse that you can see where Bianca gets her perversion from. Kissing goodbye to your lover and your son, you return to the library to find something else to do while you wait for them to return.";

				say "     Opening the door properly, you step into the room and greet the two wolves. Lifting her head, Blanche smiles upon seeing you, shuffling backwards to prop herself up against the headboard. 'Hello darling. Please excuse me if I don't get up,' she apologizes. 'I was teasing Sturm that perhaps it was time that he didn't need to protect me any more and he started tickling me and telling me to stop him if I could. Obviously I couldn't but I at least tried. Now I'm exhausted from trying.' You don't sense any falsehood in what she has told you, relief flooding your mind. Nothing untoward was happening here. Perhaps a little more intimate than most parent-child relationships at their age, but you have to give some leeway for current conditions. 'Wasn't this place a good find?' Sturm says excitedly, apparently not as exhausted as his mother. 'Bianca and I were out scavenging and we found a box of keys in an abandoned building. They were labelled with addresses and I thought that I would try to find the places that they were from. It took me a while to find the hatch, but it was the first key that wasn't for soemwhere already looted and there are still more to go!' His enthusiasm is contagious and you can't help but walk over and ruffle the fur on his head, telling him that he has done well. The look of pride on his face and the response is something to treasure. 'Thanks [BlancheMomDadTitle].'";
				say "     Sitting on the edge of the bed between Blanche and Sturm, you talk with them for a few minutes, listening as your son tells you about some of his other scavenging expeditions and his mother rests her head against your shoulder while you stroke her hair. Eventually however, Blanche interjects, 'We should be getting back. I've left Bianca looking after her siblings for long enough and she's probably wondering where we have gone. Though with her dirty mind she's probably going to have made a scenario in her head,' she sighs. Chuckling, Sturm helps his mother to her feet before offering you a hand too. Taking it gratefully, you think to yourself that he has really warmed up to you since you first met him. 'Once the others get back, we'll also have to discuss who, if anyone, is going to move here. You may find them as reluctant as I was,' he warns his mother, wiggling his fingers as though he is going to tickle her. 'I don't think I could take it. I'll just have to surrender to the will of my children on this one,' she laughs, twisting away from his hands. The three of you return to the library, making sure to lock the cellar door behind you so that no-one else can move in uninvited.";

			say "     As you close the door behind you, you get the impression that something is off. Accustomed to Blanche's many children rushing this way and that, finding the entrance hall completely empty of them distinctly strange. Worried that something may have happened to the wolf matriarch, you hurry towards where her makeshift den is in the computer room, your fear easing slightly upon finding Bianca calmly reading through the manual for her video camera. Quickly questioning her as to the whereabouts of her mother, she tells you that Sturm had found a place that might be able to be used by your progeny should the library become overpopulated and that Blanche had gone with him. Due to this find, her other brothers and sisters has gone off in the hopes of finding similar places, eager for more of their mother's approval. After getting directions where to go and finding that it is only a few minutes away, you leave the library again and weave down an alleyway a little way down the street to find a non-descript house nestled behind all the other buildings.";
			say "     If you hadn't been told about it, you're not sure that you ever would have found it. The exterior isn't anything special, concrete with only a few grimy windows, and the inside isn't much better, shattered shelves and empty food wrappers stirring around as you pass by. However, it isn't the house that is of interest you, but the cellar access that Blanche's daughter told you is accessed from the garden. Down the side of the house, you find a hatch open and you descend the stairs, soon finding yourself in a small, tidy room lit up by a naked bulb on the ceiling, the rumble of a generator audible behind a steel door to your left. Going through the other door ahead of you, you enter a thinly carpeted living room, a few wooden chairs and even a sofa pushed against one of the walls opposite a table with an old radio. You wonder to yourself if this was some sort of budget bunker, a storm shelter, or just the result of someone converting their cellar into another part of the house. Your musings are interrupted by the sound of laughter on the other side of the door in front of you. Curious as to what is happening, you open the door a crack and look through, the sight on the other side quite the surprise.";

Eventually, Sturm relents and allows his mother to catch her breath, collapsing on the bed beside her. Panting and still fighting back laughter, your son rests his head on his mother's shoulder and snuggles up next to her. Opening the door properly, you step into the room and greet the two wolves.
