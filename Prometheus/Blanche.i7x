I am really thankful though for your help.' She brushes her fur nervously and, realizing that she's nude, grabs one of a few spare blouses she has folded on the bookcase.

Holding her muzzle upwards, the powerful beast kisses and licks at the wolf's face, moaning how lovely she'll look filled with her whelps. The wolf's eyes go wide at this, but she's too overwhelmed by the mix of pain and pleasure from the rough mating to do anything. The dragon creature growls loudly and lustfully as it drives hard into its prey one last time, causing the wolf to yelp then struggle, then become very still. The lizard cock glows from within the wolf's belly and soon you can tell the canine is being filled with molten sperm. The white wolf's belly expands as it is filled, and glows red as its new cargo of life shine through her skin and fur.

Given that this is one of the harshest areas in the city, you can imagine the strain that he puts himself under to ensure that his mother and the rest of his family remain safe, though you are sure that the others occasionally take their turn at guard duty to allow him some time to rest or relax. The door opens before your hand can reach it and the naked frame of Blanche appears in the doorway, your proximity causing her to let out a pleased gasp. '[if player is male]My two favorite men side by side[else if player is female]My favorite woman comes to see me[else]My rescuer comes to see me[end if]!' the wolfess MILF exclaims, giving you a warm hug. 'Come inside. Yes, you too Sturm, we were just about to organize an excursion into the city for food, water, and building materials, and your joint expertise would come in handy.'";
	say "     Sturm looks reluctant to leave the door unguarded, but the constant harrying and reassurance from his mother eventually convinces him that he can spare a few minutes to take part in the discussion and he follows behind you as you enter the office building. You come to a stop in what you assume is the living area where [if HP of Blanche < 11]three [else]nine [end if]other wolves are standing around a table with a heavily-edited city map spread across it. They give you a friendly wag before returning their attention to their mother who takes the prime position to see the map, Sturm shouldering past you to stand beside her and leaving you to stand opposite them with everything upside-down and wondering why he treats you with what feels like passive hostility.";

	say "     Your musings are cut short by discussion of where to scavenge beginning, voices being raised and opinions loudly stated. One of the younger wolves seems to believe that they can make do with scavenging only in the Capitol District in order to save their energy and to remain close by should they need help from the rest of their siblings. You reply that while they might spend less time traveling, the creatures around here are more ruthless than many in other areas of the city, Sturm, surprisingly, echoing agreement, adding that doing so risks not everyone coming back, his appraisal causing the younger wolf to nod his head in acceptance of the logic. Further suggestions of varying plausibility are put forth over time, most of them being countered for one reason or another by Sturm, who seems zealously protective of all of his siblings, garnering your respect for his loyalty and insight despite his usually surly demeanor towards you.";
	say "     As a lull in the conversation occurs, you suggest that they could try the park. There's clean water, fresh fruit, and not too many areas where creatures might be able to surprise them. On top of that, the infected there are less dangerous than the dragotors and orc slavers that roam the hellscape around their home. Sturm pulls a face as you mention the danger of where they live but grudgingly agrees that the park is likely to be a decent place to scavenge. 'Didn't I tell you that [SubjectPro of Player] would have something to add?' Blanche teasingly asks her eldest son, earning a scowl from the large white wolf. He does however give you a nod of recognition and for the rest of the discussion you don't see him glowering at you at all.";

Blanche's various children return to their various duties such as tidying bedrolls, checking medical supplies, and keeping watch outside, a few of them coming over to talk to you as they pass by. To your surprise, Sturm does so too. 'You know the city better than I do,' he grudgingly greets you, skipping any pleasantries. You agree, but reply that he seems quite knowledgeable himself and he seems to be doing well protecting his mother. 'Someone should, and you seem to feel that you have better things to do,' he snarls. The white-furred wolf pauses to take a breath before continuing in a more civil tone. 'Mom has so much love in her. We would do anything for her. We all would,' he quickly adds upon noticing one of your eyebrows rise. 'Just make more time to be with her. I may be her favorite child, but she misses you when you are gone.' With that, he stomps away muttering under his breath, leaving you to shake your head and watch the activity around you.";

Noticing his expression, Blanche clips him around the ear with a frown. '[SubjectProCap of Player] hasn't done anything wrong. Why do you bear [ObjectPro of Player] such ill-will?' she softly growls. Looking suitably chastened, the large male wolf greets you. 'Father. We were just readying for our initial scavenging trip to the park. It must be fate that you would appear at the right time,' Sturm explains, unable to keep the sarcasm out of his voice at the end, earning a stern poke in the side from his mother. 'We would be delighted if you had the time to accompany us,' Blanche says brightly, though you notice that she keeps one eye on her eldest son to keep him in check. For all her faults, she seems to hold absolute authority over her family.";
	say "     Having come here to visit her anyway, you see nothing wrong with escorting them on this little expedition and readily agree to go with them. 'Wonderful. We're all going, so it'll be like a family outing,' she beams before bustling around making sure that everyone has a backpack. While she is distracted, you approach Sturm and remind him that his mother will be safer with you there, a point that he grudgingly concedes. 'You at least have more experience than some of my siblings,' he grumbles. He pauses for a moment before sighing and continuing, 'Mom's right. I shouldn't be so hostile towards you. While you are seldom around, no one else seems to mind and Mom says you risked your life to save her from an ebonflame drake when you first met. I'll try to be better, but it might take me some time so be patient please.' This is probably the most vulnerable you've seen him and you reassure him that he can have as much time as necessary, relieved that he might be able to move past his surly treatment of you.";

A chorus of yeses answer her and everyone files out of the building with Sturm rushing to the front, leaving you in about the middle of the column next to Blanche. Perhaps due to the size of the group, you are largely left alone by the hostile residents of the city, leaving you free to converse with the wolf MILF. 'Thank you for doing this,' she says, beaming at you in her typically cheerful manner. 'It's a shame that we aren't going to the park merely for a picnic though. Just you, me, and the children sitting on a rug eating sandwiches and drinking lemonade...' You agree that the nanite apocalypse has rather put a dampener on such activities but point out that it did allow you to meet her in the first place. 'That's true, and I wouldn't give up Sturm for that. He's my good boy.'";
	say "     One of her other children gives Blanche a hurt look at such a specific example, causing her to hurriedly reassure them that she has no regrets about any of them and loves them all. You chuckle internally at this faux pas, knowing well that it won't be the last time she makes it, though with how much devotion Sturm shows her, even compared to his siblings, you can hardly blame her if she returns his feelings. You just hope that he'll look up to you similarly one day, especially after your earlier conversation. 'They grow up so fast,' Blanche muses as she returns, her child suitably soothed. You ask whether she had any children before the nanites overwhelmed the city. Giving you a strangely sad look, Blanche replies, 'No. I got pregnant in my last year of high school. But my life went to hell and I ended up miscarrying.' You quickly apologize for bringing up such an awful memory, but she waves you off. 'You weren't to know. I'll tell you more later, but I don't want our children listening in. I haven't even told Sturm.'";

Don't you know the city's dangerous these days?' [SubjectPro of Diego] teases Sturm, [PosAdj of Diego] smirk slipping a bit as you and Blanche approach too. 'I see you brought your mother and her [if player is male]boyfriend [else if player is female]girlfriend [else]this time.' Sturm growls in response, seemingly familiar with the coyote, taking a step towards [ObjectPro of Diego], but the brown-furred canine backs away, raising [PosAdj of Diego] hands appeasingly. 'Relax kid. I'm not going to cause any trouble. I have some moral standards,' [SubjectPro of Diego] says in a conciliatory tone.";
	say "     Sturm snorts, but advances no farther, allowing [if PlayerMet of Diego is true]Diego [else]the coyote [end if]to retreat into the park. Hopefully you won't have another run in with [ObjectPro of Diego] while you are here. Having reached your destination and seen off the initial threat of the coyote, Blanche has her children gather around to remind them of your objective in the park. 'We're looking for clean water or food that we can easily take back to the den. Do not steal from others and don't exchange [']favors['] for resources. Don't bother scavenging for building materials this time. It's a long walk back home and food and water are more important,' the wolfess clarifies, her tone brooking no argument. 'Sturm has the most experience with scavenging, so I'll let your brother [if HP of Blanche < 11] lead your group[else]split you into groups[end if]. I don't think that I will be of much help so [if Player is not defaultnamed][Name of Player] and I shall see what we can find in the central picnic area[else]I'll see what I can find in the central picnic area[end if]'.";

	say "     Sturm nods his acceptance of this plan and quickly organizes his siblings further before they gradually branch off from the path to look for food and water deeper in the park away from where you and Blanche are heading. 'Now that they are all busy, I can continue our earlier conversation before we do some scavenging of our own,' the wolf matriarch quietly informs you, glancing around to make sure that none of her progeny are nearby. Sitting down on a bench, she pats for you to sit beside her, an offer which you readily take her up on. This close to her, you can easily smell her natural aroma emanating from her, a mixture of arousal and clean fur. 'I was one of the top students in my final year of high school and I wouldn't have had much difficulty getting into a prestigious college, something which my parents were extremely proud of, especially as I was an only child. They weren't the most affectionate people, always demanding that I do better, but I loved them anyway. I didn't really know much different,' Blanche explains.";

He kept getting back up each time they knocked him over, each time a little more bloody and bruised until his older sister, Lupa, appeared and beat them up. Even after all that, Wolf still asked if I was alright before being taken to the nurse. Lupa nearly ended up suspended, only avoiding it because she was protecting her brother. They barely left my side at school from then on and Wolf became my childhood sweetheart.'";

As I continued to get good grades at school, they gave me permission to sometimes invite them and my other friends over at weekends to hang out, but I wasn't often allowed to visit them at their own homes. I was kept on a tight leash, if you'll excuse the canine pun. When I was sixteen, Wolf and I began dating properly, or as well as we could with my parents constant interference, and it was one of the happiest periods in my life, especially when Lupa, rather than my parents would chaperone us on our dates as she was amenable to our demonstrations of affection. We did get some strange looks for other people though.'";

'As time went by, I grew attracted to Lupa, though I still had feelings for Wolf. As you can imagine, I was quite torn between the two, but I can't have been that subtle as one day while we were walking home together, they informed me that they were willing to share and that outwardly I could continue to date Wolf but in private I could be with either or both. If I wanted to explore my sexuality, this seemed a fool-proof plan, especially as being a lesbian or bisexual was treated even worse than it is today. Or at least before where I worked became surrounded by lava,' she jokes, trying to cheer herself up. 'At first I was scared of this. Would it make me a slut? But over time I warmed up to the idea of being in a three-way relationship. If it made me happy, why should I care? Eventually I summoned the courage to agree to their proposal and we began to fool around from time to time.'";

Their father was in the military and frequently on deployment, but when he was home nearly all of his time was spent with Wolf and Lupa, whether it was playing games with them, taking them out for hikes in the forests, or reading them bedtime stories. He was a little gruff at times, but he loved his children in a way that my parents lacked. I'd have traded all the privileges that I grew up with to have had a father like him. Their mother was the manager of a supermarket and always seemed to be exhausted. It wasn't uncommon to see her spend the evening watching television while struggling not to doze off. I wonder now how much of a strain it was for her to raise two children alone with such success. I didn't give her enough credit at the time. Just between you and me, I have enough trouble with mine, and they grow up a lot faster.";
		say "     'In my final year of high school there was one night that, curious as to what it would feel like, I asked Wolf not to pull out when he came. It was a stupid thing to do in hindsight, but at the time it felt exciting and I can hardly blame him for agreeing despite Lupa's protestations. Her fears came true and I discovered that I was pregnant a few weeks later. I still had several months of school left so of course I was unmarried and there was no way that I would be able to conceal it from my classmates, teachers, or even worse, my parents. I would become a social pariah and my parents['] reputation would be ruined. Unsure what to do, I made what may have ended up being the worst decision in my life. Accompanied by Wolf and Lupa, I asked my parents for help. Parents are meant to love and protect you no matter what. Mine did not.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Tears stream down Blanche's face, the memory still raw and painful. She wipes them away with a paw and continues with a sob. 'My mother wouldn't stop crying, only pausing every now and then to scream that I was a harlot or a whore before returning to her weeping. My father initially just stood there, his anger building up until he couldn't contain it any more. The rest is mostly a blur, but I remember Wolf putting himself between my father and me, everyone shouting, my mother clawing at Lupa's face, and the sound of glass breaking as Wolf fell on a table. I don't remember much after that other than being put in an ambulance while my parents were escorted away by police officers. Their money and standing wouldn't protect them from what they had done.'";

I didn't get to testify against my parents, the prosecution had enough evidence without involving me, though maybe they talked to me and I just don't remember. I was taken to live with an aunt on the east coast so I never saw Wolf and Lupa again, but I was told that they would recover in time despite their injuries. My aunt was cold towards me, but I managed to graduate high school before she told me that I had to make a life of my own and that she hoped that she would never see me again. My life since then has been fairly uneventful, even college is a blur, but that's effectively how I ended up here.' There are still damp patches on Blanche's face, but she seems to have run out of tears for the moment, looking very drained nonetheless. You wrap your arms around her and tightly hug the white wolf, feeling her relax in your embrace. 'All I want is for my children to be safe and I'm not sure whether the office den can provide that much longer but I don't want to let them down like I did Wolf and Lupa.'";
