She looks at you curiously with her dark-gray eyes as you inspect her, tilting her head in an adorable fashion.

Umbra and I understand that you had important things to do in the city. But that wasn't what you asked, was it? You asked about me, perhaps to try and improve communication and bonding within the pack?

Some have particularly adult material...' she says with a blush before feeling a need to justify herself. 'I hope that you can understand. From what I've read, parents don't like to think of their children being involved in anything lewd, but this city is so drenched in the smells of sex, this library no less than anywhere else.

It isn't the most comfortable posture, but I will admit that I do like to show off, whether it is by showing off my mind or displaying party tricks like walking on two legs. Even having this conversation allows me to show off and for that, I thank you,' she joyfully informs you.

But back to myself. If someone else is helping me defend myself, especially if it is Umbra, then you don't need to worry about me in a fight.

That is him showing how much he cares when your grasp of wolf communication isn't as fluent as our own. I'm so glad that he expresses his emotions so easily compared to some of the men in the books I read. Why is a lack of emotion considered an attractive trait in males so often? I think that Umbra may be more than a little enamored with you, [if Player is submissive]and considering the times he's seen you present yourself in the city, he may ask you to get to know him on a more physical level[else if Player is dominant]and he sees you as a strong role model, unafraid to say what you want, so he may want to learn from you [italic type]intimately[roman type][else]and he is impressed by how capable you are, seeing as how you have survived so well in the current situation between the roaming creatures and the invading army, so if you give him the chance, he may ask whether you would be interested in getting closer to him[end if].

What else is there to say about [ObjectPro of Fang]? I think that [if Fang is male]I'm his favorite, though don't tell Umbra I said that. He might disagree, and I wouldn't want to have to shatter that hope. What father doesn't like having a daughter to pamper and impress[else]Umbra is her favorite, but I can hardly blame her.

That is him showing how much he cares when your grasp of wolf communication isn't as fluent as our own. I'm so glad that he expresses his emotions so easily compared to some of the men in the books I read. Why is a lack of emotion considered an attractive trait in males so often? I think that Umbra may be more than a little in awe of you, and he is impressed by how capable you are, seeing as how you have survived so well in the current situation between the roaming creatures and the invading army. He may want to learn to be more like you. When you have always been there for us, I share similar admiration towards you.' She seems to be squirming slightly and you raise an eyebrow in question.

Lux is curled in a ball, fast asleep occasionally letting out a yip in response to something in her dream. Fang as usual is on guard, focused on watching the outside world for threats or anything else that may require your attention. Umbra seems to be assisting [ObjectPro of Fang], the young wolf looking to be a mirror of his [if Fang is Male]father's [else]mother's [end if]stance, though quite a bit smaller, as they watch the movements outside together. Approaching them, you see that they aren't merely keeping watch, but observing a display of predatory superiority as one of the gryphons that you see so often is under attack by a wyvern, the difference in combat capability nearly as great as the difference in size. While Fang seems content to just watch and make sure that neither approaches [PosPro of Fang] den, looking at Umbra, his eyes seem to be following both of the combatants['] movements and tactics.";

The wyvern in contrast knows that this confrontation is of no danger to them and contents themselves with toying with their adversary, displaying its dominance rather than trying to inflict harm. Both of their tactics could potentially be useful, the knowledge of when to try and evade attacks, when to strike, and when to intimidate your opponent rather than harm them. The gryphon finally sees their chance as one of the wyvern's wings brushes a roof, unbalancing it, and with a desperate flap of its own feathery wings, the gryphon flees, the wyvern flying in pursuit a moment later. The excitement over, you ruffle the fur on Umbra's head, hoping that he learnt the same lessons from the conflict as you.

You are slightly surprised that Lux has chosen her as company, but when she drops the book into the husky's hand and sits down beside her as she opens the book, you realize that she is getting help with her reading and who better than someone who taught themselves to read as they grew up under similar circumstances. Not feeling the need to remain hidden considering they can probably both smell or hear you, you approach the two of them and sit and listen to Amy read 'Little Red Riding Hood'. You can see your daughter's eyes following the words on the page as they are spoken aloud, a rogue thought imagining her memorizing the appearance and pronunciation for future reference, though you mostly dismiss this as farfetched, she's more likely to be looking at the pictures.";

You return her affection, stroking her ears and whispering reassurances. It would seem that the book is an extended version of 'Little Red Riding Hood' as it seems to be in chapters and Amy continues even after the Woodsman has rescued the grandmother, detailing Little Red Riding Hoods other adventures often involving the wolf being a villain in one way or another. Lux doesn't seem to appreciate a wolf being in this role and Amy, seeing that she isn't enjoying it much, doesn't take long to close the book. 'There are likely other books with wolves in more benevolent roles in the library if you still want me to read to you, and don't forget to practice walking on your hind legs like the wolf in the story,' the husky offers. The young wolf looks embarrassed at this, but trots over to a wall and supports her body with her front legs as she tries to balance on her hind paws. You stretch as you stand up again, readying yourself to leave, not wanting your daughter to feel self conscious about something she was, from the look of it, trying to teach herself in secret.

Happy to spend some time bonding with your daughter, you recline next to her, making sure that she'll be able to see the pages of the book. You see that it is 'Little Red Riding Hood', though from the thickness of it, there may be other stories afterwards. As you read, you can see your daughter's eyes following the words on the page as they are spoken aloud, a rogue thought imagining her memorizing the appearance and pronunciation for future reference, though you mostly dismiss this as farfetched, she's more likely to be looking at the pictures.";
						say "     As you describe the wolf being fed salty water to make him regurgitate the grandmother, Lux snuggles up against you, trusting you to protect her from such a barbaric trick. You return her affection, stroking her ears and whispering reassurances. It would seem that the book is an extended version of 'Little Red Riding Hood' rather than a collection of stories, as it seems to be in chapters and continues even after the Woodsman has rescued the grandmother, detailing Little Red Riding Hoods other adventures often involving the wolf being a villain in one way or another. Lux doesn't seem to appreciate a wolf being in this role and you can see that she isn't enjoying it much and so close the book. Giving your daughter a hug, you reassure her that you wouldn't let anything terrible happen to her or her brother, you and Fang will make sure of it. She gives you lick of appreciation for the story and the comforting words before dashing off into the maze of shelves. When she doesn't return, you gather she has moved onto doing something else and stand up again, trying to decide what to do next.";
				-- 4: [ Lux and Umbra playing with Dash ] [or Fang and Children]
					if Dash is booked:
						say "     Feeling like reading some [one of]Dickens[or]Mills & Boon[or]Agatha Christie[or]Tolkien[at random], you begin to navigate your way between the shelves to reach the section that you hope they will still be. As you pass by Children's Literature, you are forced to leap out of the way of several blurs, upsetting a stack of magazines. With a quick look, you are able to identify the blurs as your children Lux and Umbra, as well as the fox kit, Dash, the three of them racing around the gaps between the shelves letting out excited yips as they pursue each other. You wonder whether they are playing something sophisticated like Tag, or whether it is just 'Chase-Each-Other-Until-You-Flop-Over'. Judging from the lack of contact, you guess the latter, making you smile at the simplicity of the games played by the young. It doesn't take you long to decide that watching the children play will be a more enjoyable use of time than reading a dusty, old book and you walk over to librarian's desk in the middle of the children's section so that you can watch more easily with less chance of being struck by a canid going at mach 5.";
						say "     It doesn't take long for the three of them to have circled around to you again, still sprinting as though pursued by demons. Currently Lux is in the lead, eyes wide and tongue lolling out of the side of her mouth. Behind her is Dash, the small fox keeping up exceptionally well despite his smaller size. Bringing up the rear is Umbra, though he seems to be tiring himself less than the other two, perhaps pacing himself in order to claim victory by the end, if whatever game they are playing can be won. You can hear them all panting, the energy that they put into their chase gradually depleting until they all collapse on their sides, tongues spilling from their mouths and saliva pooling by their faces. Not long after they have laid down, Fang appears and trots over to them, sniffing them just to make sure that they are alright. You wonder whether it was [ObjectPro of Fang] who put them up to this game in order to tire them out, the thought amusing you as you walk over and ruffle the fur on [PosPro of Fang] neck. Now that that is over, you have to decide what to do next.";
					else:
						say "     Wondering how Lux and Umbra are, you decide to pay them a visit, walking towards the entrance to the library. They are larger than they used to be, and much more mobile, a problem you find that Fang seems to be dealing with as you near the front door. Both the children, perhaps bored of being stuck inside, seem to be trying to get past their [if Fang is Male]father [else]mother [end if]and see what the outside world is like, a desire Fang is determinedly obstructing bodily. As Umbra attempts to dart behind [ObjectPro of Fang], [SubjectPro of Fang] spins around and lightly nips him, sending scuttling back with a squeak. Lux tries to take advantage of her brother's diversion and begins to slip beneath her [if Fang is Male]father's [else]mother's [end if]chest but [SubjectPro of Fang] takes a step back and pins her under one paw. 'Stay,' you hear Fang growl before releasing [PosPro of Fang] daughter to go back and sulk with her equally outwitted brother.";
						say "This attempt thoroughly quashed, Fang is able to return to [PosPro of Fang] duty of guarding the library, though you doubt that this will be their final attempt. Seeming to feel sorry for disappointing [PosPro of Fang] childrens['] desire, the larger wolf settles down and begins to snuffle and lick them, a quiet conversation of rumbles and murmurs between them as they display their affection to each other. You decide to leave them to it, not wanting to interrupt their moment, even though they would likely welcome you joining them too.";

				-- 1: [ Fang and the children 'hunting' just outside the library ]
					say "     As you pass by the entrance to the library, you are surprised to find Fang absent, [if HP of Fang < 3]the rope that is usually around [PosPro of Fang] neck lying abandoned on the stone floor[else if HP of Fang is 5 or HP of Fang is 6]which is surprising considering how determinedly [SubjectPro of Fang] protects [PosPro of Fang] territory and family[else]an empty feeling filling you since your Alpha is away[end if]. Lux and Umbra also appear to be missing, and you hope that they are with their [if Fang is Male]father[else]mother[end if], considering it has been quite some time since you saw them. A flash of white catches your eye as you look [if HP of Fang < 3]over Fang's discarded restraint[else]towards the door[end if], a note with the single word 'Outside' scrawled on it. How kind of your daughter to leave you a note, at least you assume that it was her, considering her superior talent for human tasks compared to the two male wolves. Curious to see what exactly they are up to, you stride out the front door and glance around, the area unusually quiet. Movement down the street draws your attention, and you immediately recognize the approaching group to be Fang and the children. They notice you at the same time, the two pups, if you can call them that anymore, bounding over to you, tails wagging wildly.";
					say "     Fang continues [PosPro of Fang] sedate pace but seems just as pleased to see you, [PosPro of Fang] tail waving at a similar rate. They are all carrying objects in their mouths, the two males holding tins between their teeth, whereas your daughter is carrying several bottles of water in a shopping bag. It would appear that Fang is teaching [PosPro of Fang] children to scavenge in the city, a useful skill to be sure, though you hope that the water wasn't taken from someone that really needed it... You discard the thought and ruffle the fur on their heads affectionately and praise them, telling them how clever they are and saying jokingly that soon they won't be needing you anymore. While they seem to respond well to the praise, the jest causes their cheerfulness to fade, and they begin to anxiously lick at your hands. Seeing their distress, Fang gives you a reproachful look before growling, 'No. Always together.' You earnestly agree with [ObjectPro of Fang] and apologize to Lux and Umbra for worrying them and that you would never actually want to leave just because they are learning how to survive on their own capabilities. You walk back into the library together, though your children make sure to keep close to you as though just to make sure.";
				-- 2: [ Umbra and Lux fighting a gryphon ]
					say "     A cacophony of screeches and barks catches your attention, and you wonder what sort of avian creature has strayed too close to the library doors and been met by Fang. Running towards the entrance, you are caught off guard, finding Fang watching whatever is happening from the doorway rather than being part of the conflict. Intrigued as to who is fighting, you stand beside the wolf, rubbing [ObjectPro of Fang] just behind the ears as you walk past [ObjectPro of Fang] to find Lux and Umbra clashing with one of the hermaphroditic gryphons. If Fang wasn't watching the ensuing fight so calmly, you might have been concerned, but you decide to trust [PosPro of Fang] judgment, watching your children alongside [ObjectPro of Fang]. While the slashing talons of the gryphon might concern someone if they only gave the exchange a cursory look, a closer appraisal would reveal that the wolves are in sync enough for one to attack while the other dodges, drawing the creature's focus between them and making its attacks sloppy while also resulting in it expending more energy as it has to split its attention between two threats.";
					say "     You can see now why Fang hasn't felt the need to intervene. [SubjectProCap of Fang] may even have encouraged Lux and Umbra into this fight so that they can make use of the lessons you imagine [SubjectPro of Fang] has taught them or that they have learnt themselves. Lux is more reserved with her strikes, only darting in when the gryphon is sufficiently focused on her brother or when Umbra silently signals her to do so. Umbra is much more confident in his combat ability, keeping close to the gryphon's body, forcing it to constantly turn to try and protect itself, its eyes wide with distress. You gasp when the gryphon slashes at Lux with its beak, a strike that would have opened her from shoulder to pelvis, but she manages to gracefully sidestep the strike and respond by nipping it on the neck. Having seen how easily this fight could go catastrophically wrong, your children resolve to end this fight before it turns against them.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     While the gryphon's attention is on Umbra, Lux charges in and clamps her jaws around one of the avian's hind legs, maintaining her momentum and sliding beneath its undercarriage. This results in it collapsing on its side, leaving it vulnerable, wings beating frantically against the dusty ground. Lux releases its leg and together with her brother approaches the gryphon's head, growling and with fur on end, demanding its surrender. With a plaintive squawk, the gryphon stills and exposes its neck, signaling its submission. It seems astonished when they turn away from it and lope towards you and Fang, allowing it to hastily right itself and take to the skies, barely looking back. The immediate threat over, the wolf siblings relax, lying down in front of you and begin to wash each other, a ritual that Fang joins them for. You can almost see the pride radiating from [ObjectPro of Fang] at [PosPro of Fang] children, a feeling that you share considering how well they complement each other's strengths, especially since it appears that the gryphon could not manage to touch them even once. A great feeling of love swells over you, and you can't resist crouching beside them and [if scalevalue of Player > 2]encircling them all in a hug[else]hugging them one after another[end if], all of them letting out appreciative groans and thanking you with licks and nuzzles. You relax with them for a while before deciding that you should probably get back to doing your own things in the city.";
				-- 3: [ Lux practicing her speech while Umbra watches]
					say "     The sound of talking from several bookshelves over attracts your attention, and you start to walk towards the sound to see who it is. Rounding the corner, you find Lux and Umbra curled up next to each other, Lux reading aloud from what sounds like a natural history book while her brother listens intently, both of them enthralled by the pictures of flora and fauna. They look up as you approach, tails thumping against the floor in greeting. '[if Player is female]Mother[else]Father[end if],' Lux barks joyfully, closing the book and placing it on a stack beside her. Among the books, you spy a dictionary, a few children's books, and some young adult fiction, several of which sound quite saucy from the titles. You decide not to pry as you wouldn't want to discourage her from learning by embarrassing either of them should it be a touchy subject. Crouching down beside them, you express admiration and pride that they are putting so much effort into learning and maturing in their different ways. While you talk to them, you stroke their sides, feeling the thick insulating fluff beneath the more robust outer fur.";
					say "     Curiously, Umbra appears to have softer and thicker fur than his sister, features that you didn't expect from the more physically-minded sibling. Lux's fur is still soft and lush, but feels finer in your fingers and flows through your hand more readily. You can hear appreciative groans from the both of them at the attention that you are giving them, and you wonder whether they would enjoy a good grooming at some point, though you would miss the tactile sensations if you used a brush instead of your fingers. You stand up and encourage them to continue their self-teaching, not wanting to disrupt their learning any more than you have. They give you a lick goodbye before you begin to walk away again, but as you do, you feel an unexplainable urge to watch them without them knowing. Strangely, they don't return to their reading, appearing to converse with each other in growls and whimpers that you can't interpret. Then to your astonishment, they stand up first onto all fours before lurching onto just their hind legs, using the shelves as supports. Lux seems unsteady on her paws but isn't making use of the shelves as much as her brother, who can only take a few steps before having to restore his balance. Nonetheless, you doubt that it will be long before they will be capable of walking on their hind paws for extended periods. You watch them for a few moments before slinking away, allowing them their privacy while they experiment and learn. Reading, talking, and walking on their hind legs, your children really are amazing.";
				-- 4: [ A play fight between Umbra and Lux ]
					say "     The sound of thumping and the occasional growl or bark draws you towards the entrance of the library to see what the commotion is. You are met by Lux and Umbra eyeing each other, chests low to the ground and hindquarters raised, tails waving back and forth. Fang looks on with interest, and you walk over to stand beside [ObjectPro of Fang], stroking [PosPro of Fang] head as you watch your children together. Umbra bounces forward, Lux tucking her tail for a moment as she leaps back to evade her brother's lunge before pouncing forward herself. Umbra doesn't retreat, instead tucking his head beneath her chest and using his superior size to flip her on her side and letting out a snort as though to say, 'Really? That was simple.' She recovers quickly, rolling over and regaining her feet while thinking through what to try next, her brother watching her intently as he waits patiently, shifting his paws in response to her changes in posture. There is little doubt in your mind that Umbra is the more physically capable of the two of them, his larger size and time spent watching the monsters outside lending him an edge that Lux hasn't gained from her more intellectual pursuits.";
					say "     To your surprise, Lux feints to the left before striking from the right, catching her larger brother off guard and gripping the scruff of his neck lightly between her teeth. Fang seems intrigued too, neglecting keeping watch to observe the play fight between your shared children. Umbra's reaction astonishes you even more, the dark-furred wolf slumping sideways on top of his sister, trapping her underneath him as she emits a startled yip. She desperately scrabbles to get out from beneath him, managing to escape the unorthodox tactic in a few seconds. She seems a bit muted at being so easily countered by her brother, her tail drooping slowly. Everyone present seems to realize that in straight combat, Umbra will likely come out on top over his sister. Seeing the paler wolf's expression, Umbra rolls on his back in front of her, licking her throat and muzzle submissively, demonstrating that despite his success in their play, he still loves her and views her as above him in the pack. This seems to break her moment of somberness, her tail wagging steadily as she licks her brother in return to demonstrate no malice towards him. The two young wolves look up at you and Fang watching them approvingly, pleased with the strength of their bond. They rush over to you, enthusiastically sharing licks and affectionate vocalizations with you both, a gesture that you return equally lovingly. You relax and enjoy this family moment, luxuriating in a sea of soft wolf fur. Whatever you were meant to be doing can wait.";

						say "     You catch a flash of a dark-furred tail disappearing upstairs, and for a moment, you wonder who it could be. However, a quick glance at Fang calmly guarding the entrance makes you realize that it was likely Umbra, and you follow, curious as to the reason why he has gone up there. Not bothering to try and hide your presence, you sedately follow him, your son flicking an ear in front of you upon hearing your movement on the stairs. Upon reaching the top, you see the wolf approach Carl, who is, as usual, watching the city out of a window, a pair of binoculars slung around his neck. Perhaps feeling a presence behind him, the husky soldier turns around, giving you a nod and ruffling the fur on Umbra's head. [if HP of Carl is 30]'Hello, my Alpha,' he greets you before crouching down beside the wolf. 'Who's a good boy? Yes. It's you!' he croons softly to the lupine, vigorously scratching him under the chin. [else]'Come to check in on me, you two?' he asks as he crouches down in front of the wolf, stroking the back of his neck while whispering what you are sure is nonsense. From the snort that Umbra gives, he seems to think so too.[end if]";

[if HP of Carl is 30]The husky seems a bit surprised at the wolf speaking for once, but doesn't comment and nods his head in agreement. 'Yes. You help.' [else]'Ooh. The mighty wolf graces us with his words,' Carl teases before losing his footing when Umbra pushes his shoulder firmly against him. You hear the husky light-heartedly mutter 'ass' under his breath as he clambers to his feet again. [end if] 'Perhaps he views it as doing his part to help his [if Fang is Male]father [else]mother [end if]downstairs, and I can't say that I begrudge the company either. His sister comes up sometimes too, but only rarely, and she usually has a book with her. I swear that her paws change into hands at times...' He lapses into silence and stares out the window again. Your curiosity sated, you turn to walk away, Carl absent-mindedly raising a paw in farewell and Umbra wagging his tail against the floor a few times before sitting beside the husky and nudging him until the soldier starts to gently pat him again. As you return downstairs, you muse over how well your lupine children seem to get on with the other residents of the library.";

Not bothering to try and hide your presence, you sedately follow him, your son flicking an ear in front of you upon hearing your movement on the stairs. Upon reaching the top, you see the wolf approach a window and gaze at the view, eyes avidly watching for movement that might be a threat. As you reach him, he leans against you, taking comfort in the contact with someone he cares about. You gently stroke behind his ears, a soft murmur of appreciation escaping from the corner of his mouth, making you smile. A flicker of movement outside distracts Umbra for a moment, his ears pricking up as he prepares to react, but he seems to deem whatever it was to be of no threat as he presses his head back against you to ask you to resume petting him.";
						say "     You hear a patter of paws behind you and turn to see Lux approaching a book clasped between her two front paws as she walks on her hind legs. 'Oh. Hello, [if Player is female]Mother. [else]Father. [end if]I wasn't expecting to see you here. Assisting my dear brother in his vigilance? With [if Fang is Male]Daddy [else]Mummy [end if]watching the front door and Umbra looking out the window, nothing should be getting in here unnoticed without magic. I don't really feel I can be of much help, but I like to be near them anyway, even if I'm just reading. Just one of the many ways that I show my appreciation for the time they spend keeping us safe.' You aren't sure how to take this, but judging from Umbra's wagging tail, he is pleased to see her, even if she isn't actively helping. You don't really see how you can be of much assistance either, so you content yourself with making quiet conversation for several minutes before returning downstairs again.";

Confident that they have both read your feelings on the matter, you return to the entrance of the library, Fang staring at you carefully, as if [SubjectPro of Fang] knew what you had just witnessed, before turning away and resuming [PosAdj of Fang] guard alongside Umbra.";

'I asked [if Fang is Male]Daddy[else]Mummy[end if] for some extra combat practice,' your daughter explains, butting your hand with her nose to encourage you to pat her. 'I'm worried that I rely too much on Umbra so I wanted to see what I am capable of while [if Fang is Male]Daddy[else]Mummy[end if] watches to make sure I'm not in too much danger.' Fang nods in confirmation before escorting the young wolf outside, presumably to find a lone husky or latex fox. Curious as to what the other wolf twin will be getting up to while he is separated from his sister, you wander through the library until you eventually come across him nudging Amy with a book in his mouth. 'Hello there Umbra. What can I do for you?' the husky cheerfully asks, running her hand through the thick fur on the back of the wolf's neck. 'Would you like me to read that to you? I would have thought that you would ask your sister.' Umbra allows Amy to take the book from his grip before answering. 'She's training. I should learn more too.'";

She said to only read it with someone I like,' he replies, sitting upright and waiting patiently. 'With someone you like, eh... Does that mean you like me?' Umbra doesn't shrink under her teasing gaze, merely nodding. 'Such a compliment from a big, strong wolf,' Amy flirts, kneeling beside him and running a paw down his chest until it drifts beneath him to lightly grasp his sheath. She barely holds it for a second before she notices you watching them, quickly letting go and beginning to stutter out an apology. 'I didn't mean to flirt with your son so blatantly in front of you, but with how handsome he is how could I resist?' Umbra just sits there panting, the tip of his shaft peeking from its sheath.

'I'll stick to reading to him for now, but I'll keep it in mind that there shouldn't be any problems if I want to take things further.' Perhaps feeling left out, Umbra presses himself up against your side and licks at your hand while gazing up at you almost worshipfully. 'Do you want to hear book too?' he asks, but you shake your head and tell him that you don't want to interrupt this chance to bond with Amy. He gives a nod in much the same way as Fang would, making both you and the husky-girl smile. 'Well. I should get to reading to him or we'll only reach the fifth sex scene before he has to go to sleep. See you round.'

'In that case, I should probably find something different to read. I wouldn't want to give him the wrong idea. Come on Umbra. Let's look for something suited for promoting platonic friendship.' Your son follows Amy with barely a look back as the husky walks off between the shelves and leaves you to return to the entrance of the library alone to await Fang and Lux's return, your feelings mixed from their unfavorable response to having their budding relationship ended by you.

	say "     Hearing the sound of conversation from behind some bookshelves, you stealthily make your way to the end and peer around the corner, finding Lux and Umbra talking. More accurately, Lux talks while her brother comments now and then, her head resting on her brother's back as they lie together. 'Do you remember [if Fang is Male]Daddy [else]Mummy [end if]teaching us when we were little? So much of it was instinct, some was genetic memory, but [SubjectPro of Fang] helped us with the finer points,' Lux asks. 'Yes. It wasn't long ago,' Umbra replies, making his sister sigh in exasperation. 'Why are you so simple-minded when it comes to conversation but seem so insightful when we're playing?' she grumbles. Her brother lets out a bark of laughter. 'You mean sparring? Still sore about earlier?' he needles her, though upon noticing her serious expression, matches her mood. 'You know [if Fang is Male]Daddy's [else]Mummy's [end if]past. We take after [ObjectPro of Fang] differently. I am the warrior, but you are the philo... phallos... you are the thinker,' he explains, struggling with a word but nonetheless insightful.";
	say "     Lux ponders this for a moment before a crafty smile spreads across her face. In a blur of movement, your daughter attempts to pin her brother, using her superior position as leverage to hold him down. Unfortunately for her, Umbra must have felt her tense as he begins to roll out of the way as she pounces on him, negating some of her advantage, but ending up upside-down beneath her. 'Clever, but dishonorable,' he playfully snarls before tucking his hind legs between them and pushing the smaller female off himself, properly escaping his sister's clutches. Rolling back onto all four paws, the two of them circle for a few moments, eyes probing their adversary for a weak point. Though you aren't sure whether he has detected your presence properly, Umbra begins to turn towards where you are observing them. Lux takes advantage of this momentary distraction to lunge for her brother's neck, her jaws closing around the thick fluff that protects his throat and snapping his attention back to the scuffle. Reminiscent of another time you saw them play-fighting, he attempts to slump on top of his sister, but she seems to have anticipated this, letting go of his scruff as soon as he loses his balance.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The result of this is that Umbra is once again lying on the floor while his sister stands over him. 'Yield, and I may yet show mercy,' Lux teases, both wolves panting. 'Never!' her brother replies, scrabbling around to try and regain his feet while his sister heckles him, preventing him from recovering from his disadvantageous situation. It would seem that you have witnessed a rare instance of Lux achieving victory over her twin! Eventually, their roughhousing ends with Lux sitting on top of her brother's face, putting him in a distinctly undignified position. 'No mercy it is,' Lux taunts. 'A few minutes of this should give you a chance to learn your place.' Given her playful demeanor, you assume that this is more to amuse herself rather than a genuine display of dominance, but given her comments earlier, it is possible that there is more to it. However, even the best laid plans have flaws.";
	say "     The first sign that something is amiss is when Lux gasps and clamps her hind-legs together on either side of her brother's face. 'That's cheating,' she whines, reflexively humping slightly as her body reacts to Umbra licking her vulva, conveniently grinding against his muzzle. 'Adapt to change in conditions,' your son manages to say between passes with his tongue, his advice doubling as an indirect request to his sister to reciprocate. Any thoughts of winning some petty play-fight are abandoned as Lux eagerly begins to snuffle and lick around her twin's sheath and balls, inhaling his scent and coaxing his cock out from within. Though they notice you as you step out from behind the bookshelf and make your way over to find a more comfortable place to observe from, they barely pay you any attention, completely surrendering to their lust towards each other, a lust born from an even deeper affection that they share.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Umbra's tongue forces the lips of his sister's pussy apart each time it slathers from her clitoris all the way to the top of her triangular vulva, the paler wolf grinding against his snout each time the tip of his tongue flicks off at the end. The pheromone-laced aroma wafting from her hindquarters directly into his quivering wet nose acts both as an incentive to continue and a torture for what he must still wait for. Meanwhile, Lux tends to his swelling cock, her paw lightly pressing a splayed leg against the floor as her tongue caresses his balls, her face full of desire and love. As more of his cock emerges, she shifts her attention towards it instead, licking from tip to base and occasionally spearing her tongue into the sheath to taste the concentrated flavor of his most intimate area and causing him to frenziedly hump twice before he manages to regain control.";
	say "     Not content to be outdone, Umbra allows his tongue to continue past the top of Lux's vulva, instead focusing on her anus. 'Umbra, stop, that tickles...' your daughter pleads half-heartedly, gasping and squirming as her brother chuckles without relenting. 'Say you give in .. Surrender. We can do something better,' he taunts. Lux looks torn between trying to retain her victory and continuing the foreplay in the hopes that the darker wolf will crack first, or experiencing a bond that she has been waiting for for quite some time. Eventually, the latter wins out. 'Fine, but on one condition,' she forces out. 'For you, anything,' Umbra replies. 'I want to look at you while we mate, for us to be able to see the love and pleasure in each other's faces.' 'Human-style. Kinky. I accept.' Upon hearing this, Lux clambers off her brother and rolls on her back, her legs splaying out to reveal herself completely to her twin, her body and eyes conveying her desperate desire.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Perhaps still coming to terms with the fact that his chance has finally come, Umbra slowly approaches his sister's vulnerable form, gazing at her for a moment to properly appreciate her while thinking about how best to go about mounting her. His decision made, your son steps over her and crouches until his shaft is resting against her puffy spade and his pre is spurting into the soft fur of her tummy. Pulling back slightly, the dark-furred wolf meticulously lines his cock up with his sister's pussy before slowly pressing forward so that the tip parts her lips. [if HP of Lux is 4]He immediately pauses, likely having encountered her hymen, and looks up to confirm that he should continue, receiving an enthusiastic nod from the pale-gray-furred beauty beneath him. With a tender smile, he makes a deliberate sharp thrust to hilt himself inside of her[else]Soon hilting inside of her, he begins to gently thrust, though this seems to frustrate her. 'I won't break that easily you know?' Lux chides him. Permissions given, Umbra begins to put more force behind his thrusts[end if], leaning forward to share a very lupine kiss with his twin.";
	say "     Seeing Lux's muscles tense, you realize that something is about to happen just before she somehow manages to roll over and trap Umbra beneath her once again, her brother too distracted by their kiss and the sensations around his cock to resist. As their tongues part, your daughter looks down at her mate triumphantly. 'I said that I wanted us to be face to face. I never specified that I would be on the bottom,' she teases as she repeatedly swings her hips up and down on his crimson penis. 'This is... acceptable,' your son grunts, thrusting up to meet her plummeting pussy with a satisfying squelch. The passionate sound of their love-making forms a steady rhythm, growls and moaning forming a bestial melody as they consummate a physical attraction to match their emotional affection. No more battling for dominance. No more competing. Just a mutual desire to sate.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Panting between fervent licks, Lux fights to maintain her eager pace, her tail swaying behind her with every motion. Beneath her, despite his disadvantageous position, Umbra matches his thrusts to compliment her movements. It is obvious that Lux's enthusiasm exceeds the limits of her body, the paler wolf not having the endurance of her brother, something that they both act upon at the same time. Once again, the two of them flip over so that Umbra is on top, allowing his sister to take a less energy-intensive role in their mating, though her whimpers are no less passionate as her brother drives his cock into her, the tone and pitch suggesting that he is rubbing the most pleasurable areas just right. His own huffing is becoming more strained too, orgasm rapidly creeping up on him. 'Do it! Knot me! Make us one again!' Lux commands him.";
	say "     Instinct and lust driving him, Umbra squeezes his knot past the flexible lips of her vulva and knots her, licking his mate's neck as she praises him. Now limited to short thrusts, he continues to hump until eventually the stimulation overwhelms him and he stiffens deep within the clutches of his sister's vagina. With a howl, your son floods his twin's fertile womb, unifying them on a new level. Lux is not far behind, shuddering in euphoria, no doubt milking Umbra's cock for all its worth. Locked together, the twin wolves content themselves with grooming each other, occasionally directing a few licks to where their bodies are joined. Smiling at such an intimate moment, you continue to watch as they wait for the tie to wane and for the inevitable flood of cum that will swiftly follow.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Many minutes pass and you start as you realize that you nearly dozed off. You look up to see that they are still tied before, with a lewd squelch, your son's softening cock can no longer hold back the deluge of cum. Soaking both the twin's hind-legs and tails, the heady scent of Umbra's semen permeates their fur as a lasting reminder of their carnal intimacy. Briefly directing a grateful look towards you, the two of them resume licking each other. Then, much to her brother's surprise as well as your own, Lux leaps atop him and grasps the nape of his neck between her teeth, even as more of his essence leaks from her gaping vulva to be absorbed into his back. Umbra remains still even as his sister squeezes and marks him. 'There. Now everyone will know that you are mine,' she declares as she clambers back off him and snuggles up against him. 'I was always yours. First. Last. Always,' your son replies, his sister joining her voice for the last three words.";
	say "     'Not that you can't share the love with others. Love isn't finite,' Lux continues, her brother nodding his agreement. 'Some may want you too,' he replies with a smirk. 'Who can blame them? We're very good wolves with soft fur,' the paler wolf giggles. As the two of them affectionately continue to praise each other and cement their new bond, you wander away only to be startled to find Fang a few feet behind you, likely having been watching too. [SubjectProCap of Fang] leans up against you without saying anything, but you can feel the approval resonating from [ObjectPro of Fang]. After scratching under the wolf's chin, you leave [ObjectPro of Fang] to have a moment with your shared children.";

'Do you remember our discussion a while ago,' your daughter asks. Though you have an inkling of where this conversation is going, you slyly tell her that she will have to remind you which discussion that would be. 'Oh you beast!

'[if Fang is Male]Daddy[else]Mommy[end if] suggested that I eat a lozenge, just in case I had bad breath. Umbra said he couldn't smell anything weird, but I thought it better to be careful,' she explains as you briefly part to take another breath. You gaze into her eyes, admiring the calming effect of her dark-gray irises and how they compliment her paler fur. With the way your daughter is looking at you, she is probably thinking similar thoughts about your appearance, especially with how her tail is wagging.";

Lost in the moment, it takes you a moment to realize that your tail is wagging too, betraying just how happy this moment is making you. It's hard to think that someone so tender of heart is of a species of apex predators, much like yourself. As if sensing your thoughts, Lux's teeth gently close around your tongue, reminding you just how sharp they are and the power of her jaw. 'Sorry, my mouth slipped.

Now do as your daughter says!' she grumbles, settling her rump atop your snout to stifle any witty retort that you might have had. With a smirk, you begin to explore your daughter's vulva with your tongue, feeling the folds envelope the tip. Meanwhile, Lux fascinates herself with your groin, alternating between nuzzling your fuzzy balls, licking the shaft, and circling her tongue around the glans.

As soon as she sees you preparing to leap up, her tail flags to the side to reveal her pulsing canine spade, lips puffy and trickling with arousal.

Indicating for you to follow him, he pads away, looking over his shoulder once or twice just to be sure that you are still there. Your son eventually brings you to a secluded nook where Fang and Lux seem to be finishing up arranging cushions on the floor[if Lux & Player First Mating is resolved] just like your time with Lux[end if], your daughter running over to you immediately upon seeing you. 'I hope that you and Umbra enjoy yourselves, he put a lot of thought into how he wanted his first time to be with you,' she says. The look of realization crossing your face cues her in that Umbra hadn't yet informed you of this, though he seems to take this in his stride. 'Sister spilt beans slightly too soon, but what she says is true. Want it to be special. You are one of closest people to me,' he informs you, slipping back into speech more like his [if Fang is Male]father's[else]mother's[end if] as he gazes at you adoringly. Lux sheepishly returns over to Fang, giving her brother privacy to explain himself to you a little more.";
	say "     'You smell nice. Very unique scent,' he tells you, repeating what he said when he first informed you of his feelings towards you, a gesture which you find rather touching. 'Decided time was right to go further. To mate with you. To deepen bond. Wanted you to be comfortable,' Umbra continues, as you slowly make your way towards the carefully arranged cushions. Fang and Lux withdraw to the edge, though you notice that they don't leave, instead lying down and watching, Fang even giving you an encouraging nod. 'I can't do candles or flowers and Lux said giving you underwear not the same. So all I can offer is a promise. To protect you and to bring you joy.' You stifle a laugh at the thought of being given panties or a jockstrap as a token of affection, kissing Umbra on the nose and whispering that you love him too. Perhaps when you have become mates properly, he can gift you some lingerie if he still feels like it. But for now, you want to enjoy your first time with your son.";

He reluctantly pulls away, barking, 'Eyes front. Focus on feel, not sight,' before padding behind you. You aren't left curious as to what he plans next for long, soon feeling fur brush against your stomach and air wafting against your bobbing cock as it emerges from its sheath, your arousal already swiftly growing. You flinch slightly when the wolf shoves his nose firmly beneath it into the musky fuzz of the scrotum below, inhaling your scent and more than likely getting your pre in his fur. A sudden rush of hot air against your shaft is rapidly followed by wetness as your son licks from your bunched-up sheath all the way to the tip of your cock, collecting the generous helping of precum that oozes in response to his tender ministrations. He repeats this a few more times, varying the speed, as well as how he curls his tongue around the sides, treating you in an almost worshipful manner.";

				say "     Just as you are wondering if Umbra is going to continue until you climax, pre constantly dribbling from your tip to trickle across your son's muzzle, he pulls away. Shuffling out from beneath you, he walks past your face to show you that even while focusing on you, his cock has slid from its sheath to sway beneath him, having become aroused by your scent, taste, and the joy of being intimate with you. You allow your eyes to follow him as he pads back towards your rear, catching an unimpeded view of his fuzzy sac as his tail hikes up behind him to tease you about just what he has in store for you. Anticipating feeling his weight on your back, you are instead surprised by his nose being pressed against your rump and his tongue gliding across the clenching entrance of your tailhole, causing you to gasp and the wolf to chuckle in response. 'Proper preparation makes it better. Plus I think I have a scent fetish. May be genetic. Perhaps, being a wolf too, you understand,' he explains between passionate licks.";
				say "     Even with his [if HP of Umbra is 5]relative [end if]sexual inexperience, Umbra seems to instinctively know where to direct his tongue, whether it is tickling across the fur of your buttock to build anticipation, circling your sphincter to make you shiver, or spearing inside of you to curl and make you moan. Despite the otherwise dominant role that he seems to be fulfilling, his persistence and enthusiasm speak of someone both enamored with and trying to impress you, though perhaps part of it is also to demonstrate his talents and care to the audience just beyond your vision. Nonetheless, you encourage and praise Umbra, ensuring that he knows what has the greatest effect on you and that his affection is reciprocated. It cannot last though, and just like when he was licking your cock, he relents before you can get too close to orgasm, or perhaps for his own benefit given the way his penis is bouncing beneath him as he walks back in front of you, copious viscous fluid leaving a messy trail on the floor.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     'I am too impatient for further foreplay, sorry. But before I mount you, I ah... I wondered if I could rub my penis on your nose. To leave my scent. If that's alright,' he struggles to ask, both embarrassed and aroused. Though you would have preferred a little more confidence and authority behind his request, you nod your consent, shivering as your snout is smeared with his potent-smelling pre. 'Thank you. I know it was a little silly, but the thought just felt so... hot.' With how drippy his cock is and how sloppy he has made your ass, any further delay is unnecessary, especially having sated Umbra's momentary whim. For the third time, your son circles behind you and you finally get to feel his weight pressing down on you, his fur warm against your back. It is nowhere near as hot as his wolfhood feels though as he eagerly searches for your anus, his claws scrabbling on the floor as he makes tiny exploratory humps until, at last, the pointed tip catches against its objective and he eases himself into the embrace of your bowels.";
				say "     Instead of vigorously thrusting as soon as he enters you, Umbra seems content to allow himself to sink into your depths as your muscles loosen and permit penetration. It is only after he has entirely hilted and taken a moment to grow accustomed to the feeling of your tailhole clenching and releasing, the heat, and the knowledge that his shaft is knot-deep in his father's bowels, that he begins to thrust at a steady pace, breathing gently in your ear as he comments on how good it feels and his gratitude that you are sharing this moment with him. You can hear that he is holding himself back, the desire to ravish you and let his inner feral wolf loose being suppressed in favor of romance and intimacy. Bearing your fangs in a smirk, you tell him that you know that he loves you, and that you love him too, but that he should let the beast loose to show you its power and passion. His voice catches, 'Are you sure? I don't want to do anything wrong,' he asks. You reassure him that he should just follow his instincts and enjoy himself, the end of your words being lost to a moan as your son immediately follows through with a lustful growl.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Gone is the gentle lover, replaced by a fearsome wolf eager to breed you and make you his. Only now do you become aware of the strength that hides beneath Umbra's fluffy exterior, and the passion hidden behind his careful speech. Though you wouldn't say that this is any more or less his true self, now that you have given him leave to mate you like his bitch, he has almost transformed into another person. Despite the intensity of his thrusts, driving your body forward and almost making you collapse, he still seems capable of adjusting his movements should you yelp in discomfort or your pleasured gasps ebb, your enjoyment still important to him despite his more bestial behavior. Perhaps the possibility of this change was predicted? Though you have no need for the cushions beneath you given your lupine form, you nonetheless make use of them lowering your chest and raising your ass to give him easier access to breed you, the soft fabric a stark contrast to the unyielding wolf pummeling you into the ground.";
				say "     Your sphincter struggles to stretch around his knot as that too begins to batter its way inside of you, heralding his approaching climax — no doubt hastened by the drastic increase in pace and the image of the compromising position that he has put you in. You can only imagine what Fang and Lux think as they watch you be dominated by your own son. A steady stream of increasingly viscous fluid drizzles from your swaying cock to soak into the fabric below, squeezed out in part by the girthy cock plundering your ass and battering your prostate exquisitely. Ultimately, you are unable to contain yourself any longer and your climax is forced out of you, leaving you in a state of euphoric exhaustion as your cum splatters your stomach and legs even as the wolf continues to unrelentingly pound into you. Unable to do anything more than whimper and beg for him to knot you, your body shudders with each impact while your mind descends into a lust-addled fog.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Finally, and with a triumphant howl, Umbra drives his knot into you one last time, drawing back with enough control so that the tie isn't broken and the bulb remains locked in the still-quivering embrace of your ass. After several uncoordinated short jabs, you feel your son's shaft swell and the first jet of virile wolf-cum floods your bowels, marking you as having been bred by him. As more and more of his essence fills you, a pleasant pressure accompanies it and you push back against him, causing the wolf to lean down and nuzzle into the side of your neck. 'My mate,' he whispers in your ear before starting to tenderly groom you while his orgasm begins to decline, until he suddenly stops and turns, lifting a hind-leg over you, so that the two of you are facing away from each other. 'Sorry, it feels like something that must be done,' Umbra explains, and you tiredly reassure him that you know the compulsion. At the moment, you're content just to stand here and feel the cum flowing inside of your gut.";
				say "     You are just beginning to doze off when you feel something shift and have a split-second to turn your head to watch as Umbra's shaft is suddenly unable to remain locked within you any longer. As his penis slips from your bowels, the crimson flesh glistening with pearlescent liquid, a healthy gush of semen follows behind, the pressure in your tummy abating little by little as your son's essence leaks from your gaping tailhole. You're not sure whether you are surprised or not when Umbra leans in and begins to lick his load from your anus, his warm tongue against your sensitive flesh making you quiver, but also strangely comforting. Once no more cum dribbles out, he moves his attention to cleaning your cock, lovingly massaging your shaft in his mouth. A quick glance at Fang and Lux suggests that they have enjoyed their front-row seats of watching you be bred, [if Fang is Male]Fang sporting an erection while his daughter struggles to surreptitiously grind her spade against the floor[else]both struggling to surreptitiously grind their spades against the floor[end if].";

Just as long as you always love me, I shall do the same. Forever.' Your son snuggles up against you and rests his head on your shoulder. 'I know that you have places to be. But stay with us a moment. Know that your family loves you.' With a smile, you agree, your happiness only growing when Fang and Lux join the pile, lending their warmth, both literally and figuratively.

You only have to consider this for a moment before a flash of crimson catches your eye. Umbra may be the one licking and sucking you, but his cock seems to have responded as if he's the one being orally worshiped, thick streams of pre splattering onto the floor from his turgid wolfhood. It would seem that your son derives immense pleasure from pleasing you. An idea forming in your mind, you [if player is Dominant]order [else]request [end if]Umbra to lie on his back, your shaft pulsing when he obeys without pause, his front paws curled over his chest and his tongue lolling out of the side of his mouth as he looks up at you with adoring puppy-like eyes, any image of innocence ruined by his splayed hind legs and bouncing wolf cock. Who could resist? Intent on sixty-nining with him, you tentatively allow him to take your weight, soon coming to the realization that he seems to be able to support you without discomfort. If anything, the display of power over him only excites him further.";
				say "     Without further ado, you wait for your son to take your penis in his mouth again before reciprocating, swirling your tongue as you steadily plunge his length deep into your maw. With your nose pressed into his balls, you begin to inhale your son's musk before exhaling sharply to ruffle his fur, your creative stimulation causing one of the wolf's hind legs to kick reflexively at the sensations that you send coursing through his body. Meanwhile, aware that you'll want your shaft nice and slick for what is to come, you begin to lightly thrust into his mouth, reveling in the way his [if Cock Length of Player < 8]tongue plays across your sensitive flesh[else]throat rhythmically clamps around your length[end if]. It is impossible for you to keep track of how many minutes pass by with how focused you become on him. The overwhelming smell of arousal and lust emanating from you both, as well as from his sister and [if Fang is Male]father [else]mother [end if]as they watch; the sight of his tailhole clenching each time you take more of his shaft between your lips; the taste of his precum promising of his virility; and the strained whines mixing with wet sucking as Umbra struggles against his growing arousal, only made worse by the pleasure he takes in pleasing you.";

Leaping up and getting a firm grip on his waist with your front paws, you cling to him tightly, being rewarded with the sound of another gush of pre squirting onto the cushions from the drippy wolf. With a few light thrusts, you align your cock with his anus before asking him whether he is ready, the tip kissing his tailhole. 'Do it. Fill me,' he begs, his words turning to a drawn out whine as you press the first inches of your cock into the embrace of his rectum. You give him time to adjust, gently sawing in and out as you gradually increasing the amount of your shaft that Umbra's bowels have to stretch around until you finally feel your groin collide with his fluffy nethers.";
				say "     With the knowledge that he can take you fully, you resume thrusting into your son at a restrained pace, taking the time to whisper encouragement in his ear and adjust your angle to more frequently stimulate his prostate. Instinctively grasping the scruff of his neck between your teeth, you immediately discover the extent of the effect that your affectionate treatment is having on him, a sizeable rope of precum sailing through the air in front of you to splatter on the floor a good two feet away. While you marvel at this, your son speaks up, 'Could you go faster? Please? I can take whatever you've got,' he growls, almost in challenge. Pausing to restore your focus, you agree with a smirk before grasping Umbra by the waist firmly enough that your claws dig in through the fur, warning him to brace himself. You can only imagine the humiliation should he lose his footing in front of his sister, not to mention Fang. He adjusts his stance, lowering his chest to the floor to give you a better angle before looking back at you and waiting for you to resume fucking him.";

However, once he finds stable purchase, Umbra starts thrusting his hips back to meet your groin with a muffled slap, the thick fur on the backs of his thighs cushioning the impact. Beneath him, his cock swings back and forth, sending long strings of arousal across the floor and up into the fluff of his undercarriage, marking the wolf with his own scent even as you mold his bowels around your shaft.

Though you keep your attention solely on your mate, a thought at the back of your mind wonders what Fang and Lux must think as they watch you dominate your own son. You can hear Umbra's grunts catching in his throat more and more until finally he cannot hold his orgasm back any longer. With a mixture between a howl and a whorish moan, copious ropes of thick, virile cum shoots from the wolf's cock to splatter on the floor, filling the room with its scent and splashing onto his chest and your feet. Though this seems to sap much of your son's energy, he resolutely holds his position, determined not to fall short of his earlier claim and disappoint you or the other members of his family.";

Tipping your head back, you let loose a howl, flooding him with your essence and marking him as being bred by you. As more and more of your semen fills his bowels, Umbra begins to pant, feeling the effects of the pressure against his prostate as the cum has nowhere to go, locked inside by your knot. His nose flaring and wiggling as he inhales the potent scent of your mating, your son sighs and looks back at you, wriggling against you affectionately. He does however look away embarrassedly when a loud gurgle escapes from his gut as you shift, making you laugh that such a thing would concern the wolf. It was him after all who was begging you to breed him and fill him up with your cum. Enjoying the moment, you lick his ear, causing him to resume looking at you with intense affection.";

Despite the otherwise dominant role that he seems to be fulfilling, his persistence and enthusiasm speak of someone both enamored with and trying to impress you, though perhaps part of it is also to demonstrate his talents and care to the audience just beyond your vision. Nonetheless, you encourage and praise Umbra, ensuring that he knows what has the greatest effect on you and that his affection is reciprocated. It cannot last though, and just like when he was licking your cock, he relents before you can get too close to orgasm. Or perhaps it was for his own benefit given the way his penis is bouncing beneath him as he walks back in front of you, copious viscous fluid leaving a messy trail on the floor.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'I am too impatient for further foreplay, sorry. But before I mount you, I ah... I wondered if you would kiss it. On the tip. If that's alright,' he struggles to ask, both embarrassed and aroused even as he bumps his shaft against your cheek. Though you would have preferred a little more confidence and authority behind his request, you follow through without hesitation, shivering as your chin and lips are smeared with his pre. 'Thank you. I know it was a little silly, but the thought just felt so... hot.' With how drippy his cock is and how sloppy he has made your pussy, any further delay is unnecessary, especially having sated Umbra's momentary whim. For the third time, your son circles behind you and you finally get to feel his weight pressing down on you, his fur warm against your back, though nowhere near as hot as his wolfhood feels as he eagerly searches for your cunt, his claws scrabbling on the floor as he makes tiny exploratory humps until, at last, the pointed tip catches against its objective and he eases himself into the cozy embrace of your pussy.";
			say "     Instead of vigorously thrusting as soon as he enters you, Umbra seems content to allow himself to sink into your depths as your muscles loosen and permit penetration. It is only after he has entirely hilted and taken a moment to grow accustomed to the feeling of your pussy clenching and releasing, the heat, and the knowledge that his shaft is knot-deep in his mother's vagina, that he begins to thrust at a steady pace, breathing gently in your ear as he comments on how good it feels and his gratitude that you are sharing this moment with him. You can hear that he is holding himself back, the desire to ravish you and let his inner feral wolf loose being suppressed in favor of romance and intimacy. With a smirk, you tell him that you know that he loves you, and that you love him too, but that he should let the beast loose to show you its power and passion. His voice catches, 'Are you sure? I don't want to do anything wrong,' he asks. You reassure him that he should just follow his instincts and enjoy himself, the end of your words being lost to a moan as your son immediately follows through with a lustful growl.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Gone is the gentle lover, replaced by a fearsome wolf eager to breed you and make you his. Only now do you become aware of the strength that hides beneath Umbra's fluffy exterior, and the passion hidden behind his careful speech. Though you wouldn't say that this is any more or less his true self, now that you have given him leave to mate you like his bitch, he has almost transformed into another person. Despite the intensity of his thrusts, driving your body forward and almost making you collapse, he still seems capable of adjusting his movements should you grunt in discomfort or your pleasured gasps ebb, your enjoyment still important to him despite his more bestial behavior. Perhaps the possibility of this change was predicted, as the cushions beneath your hands and knees prevent any chafing against the floor, and you remain comfortable as you press your chest into them to give him easier access to your soon-to-be-gaping pussy, the soft fabric a stark contrast to the unyielding wolf pummeling you into the ground.";
			say "     Your vulva struggles to stretch around his knot as that too begins to batter its way inside of you, heralding his approaching climax, no doubt hastened by the drastic increase in pace and the image of the compromising position that he has put you in. You can only imagine what Fang and Lux think as they watch you be dominated by your own son. A steady stream of juices drizzles from your cunt to soak into the fabric below, squeezed out in part by the girthy cock plundering your cunt and grazing your most sensitive spots exquisitely. Ultimately, you are unable to contain yourself any longer and your climax is forced out of you, leaving you in a state of euphoric exhaustion as your femcum splashes Umbra's thighs and balls even as he continues to unrelentingly pound into you. Unable to do anything more than whimper and beg for him to knot you, your body shudders with each impact while your mind descends into a lust-addled fog.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Finally, and with a triumphant howl, Umbra drives his knot into you one last time, drawing back with enough control so that the tie isn't broken and the bulb remains locked in the still-quivering embrace of your pussy. After several uncoordinated short jabs, you feel your son's shaft swell and the first jet of wolf-cum floods your womb, marking you as having been bred by him. As more and more of his virile essence fills you, a pleasant pressure accompanies it and you push back against him, causing the wolf to lean down and nuzzle the side of your face. 'My mate,' he whispers in your ear before starting to tenderly groom you while his orgasm begins to decline, until he suddenly stops and turns, lifting a hind-leg over you, so that the two of you are facing away from each other. 'Sorry, it feels like something that must be done,' Umbra explains, and you tiredly lift an arm to soothe his concerns. At the moment, you're content just to lie here and feel the cum flowing past your cervix.";
			say "     You are just beginning to doze off when you feel something shift and have a split-second to turn your head to watch as Umbra's shaft is suddenly unable to remain locked within you any longer. As his penis slips from your cunt, the crimson flesh glistening with pearlescent liquid, a healthy gush of semen follows behind, the pressure in your tummy abating little by little as your son's essence leaks from your gaping hole. You're not sure whether you are surprised or not when Umbra leans in and begins to lick his load from your pussy, his warm tongue against your sensitive flesh making you quiver, but also strangely comforting. Once no more cum dribbles out, he moves his attention to cleaning his cock, tasting a mixture of his own seed and your juices. A quick glance at Fang and Lux suggests that they have enjoyed their front-row seats of watching you be bred, [if Fang is Male]Fang sporting an erection while his daughter struggles to surreptitiously grind her spade against the floor[else]both struggling to surreptitiously grind their spades against the floor[end if].";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The sound of Umbra's voice draws your attention back to him. 'Thank you. This bond that we share is most precious to me,' he says, licking his lips to swallow the last of the cum smeared there. 'But don't think that this means you can't love other people too. Just as long as you always love me, I shall do the same. Forever.' Your son snuggles up against you and rests his head on your shoulder. 'I know that you have places to be. But stay with us a moment. Know that your family loves you.' With a smile, you agree, your happiness only growing when Fang and Lux join the pile, lending their warmth, both literally and figuratively. Who would have thought that such affection could come so close on the heels of passionate coupling? As you relax into the fluff, you wonder who else may have witnessed you being vigorously bred by Umbra...";
