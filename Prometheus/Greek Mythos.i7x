	say "     As you enter the museum entrance hall, the air feels different to usual as though it is charged. You consider asking Valerie about it but a loud thunderclap and the sudden appearance of an impressively bearded man interrupts this thought. 'You there. Mortal. Are you [name of Player]?' he intones grandly. You quickly nod dumbfounded. The man relaxes a bit and takes you by the shoulder as you walk down the corridors. 'I am Zeus. God of the sky, and king of the Olympians. Your actions within this plane have not gone unnoticed and as such I would like to extend to you an invitation to carry out the Labors of Herakles. I do hope you are familiar with them, but even if you aren't, I'm sure you'll manage them anyway. Though I doubt you'll be quite as impressive as my son, but I'm biased so don't be discouraged.' He seems a lot less wrathful than some of the myths make him out to be, luckily for you.";
	say "     By this time you are opposite a shrine to Hera. Beside it, an elegant woman is brushing dust off the marble and muttering rude remarks about the cleaners. Zeus coughs politely, causing her to look up. While you wouldn't describe her face as sexy, there is a regal beauty that commands respect. You stand there awkwardly, unsure what to say. The woman finally breaks the silence with a sigh. 'As my husband is too rude to introduce me, I am Hera, goddess of Marriage, and Queen of Olympus. Come sit with my by the shrine.' You allow her to guide you to a step and seat yourself at a polite distance next to Hera, allowing a bashful Zeus to sit on her other side. 'How much has he explained to you?' the goddess asks, offering you a dish of pomegranate seeds. You reply that he had only had time to say that you were invited to perform the Labors.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'When Herakles had to do the labors it was to seek redemption for killing his family, and as you can understand I did some morally questionable things to try and stop him,' Hera begins to explain. Zeus rolls his eyes when she says [']morally questionable['] but doesn't interrupt. 'Now, we use the labors more as a ritual or for ceremonial purposes when we find someone we believe worthy. We have an agreement with other parties not to interfere directly in the affairs of the city. Can you imagine how much damage could be caused by multiple pantheons of gods trying to one-up each other? It's bad enough having pretenders running around claiming to be divine and maligning our names. Some of the gods known for their trickery are walking a fine line at the moment. Loki has had several warnings for mingling with mortals under various guises, and we are not going to even mention Prometheus...' Hera trails off, grumbling under her breath.";
	say "     'I will be acting more as an adversarial force rather than your enemy. Your efforts to succeed and overcome the trials ahead of you will entertain those of us watching, even deities of other cultures. We try not to conflict with each other and watching rituals of each other's followers allows us to socialize more often,' Hera's comments. Seeing the concern on your face, Zeus quickly adds, 'We wouldn't have chosen you if we didn't think you had a chance. We want you to succeed too.' His wife wraps her arm around your shoulder, 'I didn't intend to sound as uncaring as I did. I apologize. Each time you complete a labor you shall be rewarded, as much as our agreement allows anyway, but I hope you'll at least like some of them. As I'm sure you understand, this city has a, shall we say, hedonistic atmosphere that might even shock Aphrodite or Dionysus, so some of the labors may take on a similar theme. I hope you don't mind.' From Zeus's grin, you can tell that he is looking forward to watching.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'None of us will interfere in the labors directly, so only attempt each trial when you are sure you are ready. We cannot be sure of your welfare, so you may die,' Hera informs you concernedly. 'Or become a monster's sex toy,' Zeus mutters, shrinking back under the glare directed at him by his wife. He quickly continues the speech, 'The first labor is the [bold type]Nemean Lion[roman type], an absolutely vast feline with a near-impenetrable hide. I'm not allowed to tell you how to defeat it, but I would advise finding out if you don't already know. It can be found in the [bold type]Dry Plains[roman type], so depending on whether or not you feel ready for it, I would suggest searching there.' He looks to Hera to see whether there is anything further she feels you need to know. 'Be careful hero, as amusing as Ares might find you meeting a valiant death, it wouldn't serve any purpose and we would rather you didn't take part than get yourself killed.'";
	say "     They seem to be finished explaining what they want you to do so, wanting a bit of space from them, you return to the museum entrance. Valerie is back behind the front desk reading through a book of riddles which she quickly hides upon noticing you. 'I'm sorry I wasn't here earlier. I was [italic type]advised[roman type] not to be here.' She rolls her eyes as she says this. 'What Zeus needed to tell you without me being present I probably shouldn't pry into, but be careful. Gods and mortals don't often mix well.' It would seem she would prefer not to get mixed up in the gods['] request so you keep quiet about it. A shame. She might have been able to help with suggestions for how to defeat the Nemean Lion. Should you decide to attempt the labors, you're going to have to find someone else with classical knowledge or hope you know enough yourself to succeed.";

You begin to rush towards the commotion, the sounds getting louder. Ahead of you, you see a hill with three unconscious centaurs strewn across the dirt, their breaths ragged. The grass is soaked in blood, turning your stomach, the source of which is the ragged tears in the centaurs['] flesh caused by what appears to be claws. The sound of beating hooves causes you to snap your head up as an equine body charges over the crest of the hill pursued by the largest lion you have ever seen. This centaur seems to be faring better than his brethren judging from his lack of wounds, but while he has sweat trickling over his skin, his adversary appears unfazed by the physical exertion. You doubt that this will last much longer, but you doubt you would be able to escape even if you tried.";
	say "     Still evading the lion's claws, the centaur knocks an arrow to his bow and looses back at his pursuer. To your surprise, the arrow [italic type]shatters[roman type] on impact with the feline's hide. It would seem that this is the mythical Nemean Lion. Now that you look more closely, you see the remnants of other arrows suggesting that this has been going on for some time. Why then does he still try the same tactic? Your thoughts are answered by the groans of the centaurs down the side of the hill as they regain consciousness and attempt to stand. The combatants both hear this, with the centaur shouting, 'Run, this is an adversary that we can't overcome! The interloper will buy us time.' What? The centaurs flee, their leader rushing right past you leaving you facing a bloodthirsty beast from Greek myth. If you survive this, then you're going to be having some words with him and his herd.";

I'm Hermes and I have been tasked with rewarding you. So what's it going to be; the five piece lounge set, the holiday to sunny Barcelona, or perhaps the hide of the Nemean Lion without having to get all bloody skinning a highly resistant beast?' Before you can reply, he interjects, 'Sorry, but there isn't actually a choice. Like Herakles, you're getting the skin. You don't have a use for a lounge set, and sending you to Barcelona may spread the contagion.' The unconscious lion begins to glow as Hermes raises his arms, speaking in an unrecognizable language. You shield your eyes from the rapidly brightening light and by the time you look back, a lion skin that looks fashioned in a cloak lies before you. Crouching to pick it up, you are surprised at how light it feels for its size and question the waiting god about it.";
		say "     'You can't just accept a miracle for what it is can you? You have to ask how. It's magic, and not even mine. I just acted as a sort of conduit for Hekate. It should protect you from physical harm you may come across in the city. Insults and lewd gestures will hit you just fine though, so don't put yourself in situations that you aren't comfortable with. I've got to run though, messages to deliver and travelers to watch. Enjoy!' With that, Hermes just seems to disappear as he steps through thin air, leaving you awkwardly crouched, trying to jam a lion skin into your backpack. It is at this point that you realize that you have no idea where you are going next. A voice behind you startles you out of this thought and you prepare to defend yourself as you spin around.";

'Sorry to surprise you, but I noticed that my son forgot to tell you where to go next, and I felt the reward was a little... hollow for the amount of effort you put in. So how would you like to mount or be mounted by the Nemean Lion? He's male, so if you prefer women feel free to refuse. You won't be rewarded or punished further either way.

With a loud boom, a lightning bolt strikes the hill above you, the flash blinding you for a moment. When the stars clear from your vision, the lion has returned, its coat resplendent. Another noticeable feature is the erect pink cock bobbing beneath his golden stomach, a fine gleam of pre shining. His behavior, for it is definitely a he, is closer to that of a house cat, friendly without wishing to appear too much so, brushing against Zeus's leg as it walks past. 'I'm looking forward to this,' you hear the god mutter to himself, patting the lion between his ears. 'I suppose I'll leave you to it. Don't worry, he's a lot tamer now so any wounds you get shouldn't be too serious. Oh, and he'll be banished once you orgasm so try to give him a little pleasure too.' With that, the king of Olympus vanishes in a thunderclap.";
					say "     Now that Zeus is gone, the feline shifts his focus to you, rubbing against your leg and purring. If you consider it sufficiently intelligent, then this might be attempts at bribing you into pleasuring it, and oh how you plan on doing so. [if Player is submissive]Crouching beside the lion's engorged penis, you gently begin to stroke his flank, gradually closing in on the twitching organ. Your partner's legs shiver in anticipation, copious fluids dripping onto the soil, exuding an arousing scent that stirs your loins[else]Gripping its mane, you stare it in the eyes to reinforce your dominance, being rewarded with him shrinking away and baring his throat. Content with his reaction, you crouch beside him and begin to stroke his penis, the aroma of his arousal stirring your loins[end if].

					say "     The lion's musk is much more potent beneath him, filling your nostrils to the point of even flowing into your throat. This aids you to salivate as the earthy flavor tickles your mouth and your patience runs thin. Giving your lips a cursory lick, you slip the feline cock into your mouth, looping your tongue around the shaft to taste his essence. Feeling it rotate in your mouth, you are surprised to see the Nemean Lion turning so that his face is beside your loins. As his tongue makes contact with the sensitive flesh of your member you flinch, the rough texture grazing up your length. In tandem, you orally stimulate each other, both out of desire, but also keeping in mind the final goal of you mounting your former adversary. With this thought, you allow his member to spring from within your mouth and shuffle back a bit, granting yourself a view of his dark tail hole. You consider for a moment before deciding the more lubrication the better and bring your mouth towards his backside.";
					say "     The lion takes your cock deeper within his maw as you begin to trace the tip of your tongue around the waiting orifice, his hide slightly salty with an aftertaste of his arousal. You can feel the head of your penis sliding into the lion's throat as your tongue slides over his sphincter, the hard tissue at the back of his mouth forming a pleasant ring around your length. The feline's purrs intensify as you explore his rear cavity, the vibrations being felt by both your invading organs, heightening the stimulation and causing you to shiver. The copious saliva shining from around the big cat's anus indicate his readiness if the rampant cock swaying between his slightly crouched legs wasn't enough, and you withdraw your face from his rear. You are almost reluctant to end his oral ministrations, but the anticipation of what is to come steels your resolve as you slip your shaft from his mouth with a noticeable squelch. With all necessary areas suitably slick, you are ready for the main event.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Scrabbling out from beneath him, you take a minute to admire his muscular derriere as you clamber to your feet. Testing his pulsing opening with a finger, you find it wet and eager for you as you slip your digit inside for a second. The lion lets out a growl as though to protest the sluggish speed at which you progress towards penetrating his anus properly. Lining your cock up carefully, you take a breath before driving yourself inside of him with a single thrust. The walls of his rectum squeeze around your flesh as you pound into him with vigor similar to your combat, the feline letting out grunts and purrs as his prostate is battered. [if Player is dominant]You grasp the scruff of his neck with one hand to help anchor yourself while your other strokes over his tail and around your joining. He responds by letting out an ecstatic yowl and releasing a sizable spurt of pre onto the ground[else]Your hands roam over his flanks, squeezing the muscles in his thighs and probing your joining. You lean over the feline's back, allowing one hand to reach his penis to give it a few strokes, being rewarded with a few spurts of pre that splatters the dirt[end if].";
					say "     As your coupling continues, your partner gradually presses his chest more firmly against the ground while keeping his hindquarters elevated for your firm love-making. He seems to be recognizing your dominance over him. You can feel yourself getting closer and closer to climax and intensify your thrusts. The resultant force of this causes the Nemean Lion's cock to slap against his tummy, the noise mingling with the squelches from his anus. This is apparently too much for the cat, as he emits a magnificent roar and begins to cum. A veritable flood of semen erupts from his barbed penis, flying through the air to soak the ground beneath him as well as painting his underbelly with the musky liquid. His orgasm is accompanied by the rapid contractions of his rear passage, the moist passage's caresses clasping with increased force around your rigid shaft.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     A cross between a groan and a sigh oozes from your lips as your release arrives with a vengeance for all the teasing up until now. The first spasm doesn't release any semen, but the second onwards squirts what feels like more than your balls would be capable of holding into the dazed lion's inviting colon, your twitching scrotum pressed tightly between your groins. When your muscles release the tension preventing you from moving, you both collapse on your sides, keeping your still trickling shaft in his quivering anus. Taking deep breaths, you stroke his fur as your climax comes to an end feeling apprehensive about your companion's approaching banishment. 'Don't worry. Banishment isn't death,' a male voice says from behind you. You rapidly turn your head, but see no-one. 'I'm not supposed to be here, so please forgive my not showing myself. But as I was saying, the lion will be fine. Echidna loves her monsters no matter how mundane or unworldly they appear. Good luck in the Labors.'";
					say "     You gather the being is gone from the silence that follows, only broken by the feline's deep purrs and your panting. With a flash of light, the lion vanishes, leaving you alone beside a small puddle of cum. 'Now that that's done, would you like to know your next task?' You jump slightly at the sound of Zeus's voice and resist the urge to cover yourself considering he was probably watching the whole thing. 'Well, from your lack of refusal I'll take that as a yes. You must defeat a hydra of extraordinary size. Once again, I'm not allowed to give you hints, but just in case you didn't get help for the previous labor, there are people in the city with a knowledge of myth so you could possibly ask them for advice.' As he turns to leave, he says over his shoulder, 'you'll find your quarry in the junkyard, but he's larger than the [']normal['] hydras you find there.'

Content to allow this, you focus on circling your tongue around his shaft, slathering his flesh enthusiastically. The smell of musk grows stronger as you both continue, his balls presses into your nose each time he thrusts. From the constant trickle of pre from your cock and the increasing wetness of your pussy, you doubt that it will be long before you are ready and apprehension conflicts with the eagerness to feel the large feline pounding into you.

As he comes down on top of you, you find your concern to be unfounded. Either he isn't as heavy as he looks or there is some force ensuring your pairing goes smoothly. For a few seconds you relax at the feeling of his warm fur against your naked back before another stimuli takes precedence. With a growl of determination, the lion thrusts forward, impaling your receptive body on his barbed penis.

From the increase in force that accompanies his thrusts, you wonder whether he is getting close to climax, each collision causing your turgid shaft to smack into your stomach. By this time he is nearly pounding you into the ground, his thrusts making his scrotum to slap against your tummy, the sound mingling with the squelches from your stretched pussy.

As soon as the feline takes a step back, you collapse on your side, his shaft sliding from your gaping hole, spilling a new river of semen onto the ground.

	say "     The junkyard is its usual cacophonous place, metal crashing and creatures roaring, but you have yet to see the supposedly larger hydra that Zeus told you about, or anything else worthy of being described as mythical, at least by nanite-apocalypse standards. Thoughts of how dull and fruitless this is distract you enough that it takes you a minute to realize that the ground is shaking and that the hub bub seems to be becoming increasingly muffled as though you are being submerged underwater. As the mound of rusting cars and defunct washing machines explodes outward, you watch as one of the largest monsters that you have seen charge through what was likely tons of scrap to glare downward at you before unleashing a roar that you can feel reverberate through your bones. Surprisingly, it only has one head, though this seems to be the only feature different from the other draconic hydras roaming the junkyard other than its vast size difference. It barely gives you a chance to run your eyes over its glistening scales, pearly fangs, and thrashing tail before its head lunges toward you, leaving you scrambling to defend yourself.";

Instead, to your horror, the hydra begins to stir and you watch as one of its necks divides in two, each with a fully formed head with vengeance glowing in its beady eyes. Releasing an ear-shattering roar, the Lernean hydra charges at you once more. It would seem that your fight is not yet over...";

				say "     On edge from the hydra's recovery from last time, you wait cautiously to make sure that it is defeated. Your fear is well-founded as barely later, the beast staggers to its feet again with a new neck growing from its shoulders with a draconic head with a maw full of massive fangs. You're beginning to think that you've made a mistake fighting this thing, especially alone. However, your regrets are soon cut short by the hydra charging at you once more with murderous intent.";

					say "     Not forgetting what has happened the last two times that the Lernean Hydra seemed defeated, you only drop your stance sufficiently to allow yourself to take a few deep breaths for when it inevitably gets back up again. Once again, your caution is proved justified as the beast recovers once more a new head growing and joining the cacophony of snarls that it is emitting. As it readies to charge, your conflict is interrupted by a thunderclap and the arrival of a figure wearing a helmet and armor and wielding a spear between the two of you. 'Stop! This labor is completed,' they command, their voice strong but feminine, slamming the butt of her spear into the ground. The hydra snaps and snarls at the warrior but she doesn't flinch even as its teeth click within inches of her face. 'Sleep. By the time that you wake, your rage will be soothed,' she responds, softly stroking the side of its head as it begins to calm until eventually it falls into slumber.";
					say "     Turning towards you, the woman introduces herself. 'I am Athena, goddess of wisdom, crafts, and those who undertake heroic endeavors. While you have demonstrated your courage and prowess and thus succeeded in this labor, you did so through brute force rather than making the wise decision to have help in overcoming the hydra. Even Herakles didn't do so alone and surely there would have been someone in this city who could have provided you with some guidance. Nonetheless, allow me to grant you a boon to help you survive long enough to complete the other labors.' You are too surprised to move when Athena banishes her spear and steps up to you, placing a hand on your chest while you stand still and look at her with a confused expression.

You are just beginning to think that you'll return to the temple in the museum to get more guidance when you see a goat-legged satyr hiding behind some bushes, seeming to be spying on something beyond them. Sneaking up beside them, you peer out past the leaves and spot a naked young woman swimming back and forth in a swimming pool, prompting you to avert your gaze again and instead stare at the satyr, waiting for him to notice you. He is so engrossed in the view that you have been crouched beside him for nearly thirty seconds before he senses your presence and without even looking at you, falls over with a startled yelp. 'I swear I didn't mean to spy on her, it just sort of happened. Please don't set the wolves on me,' he pleads, pressing his face into the dirt.";
	say "     You find this to be a bit of a strange reaction and question him as to why you would do such a thing. Voyeurism isn't exactly an uncommon occurrence in the city after all. His head snaps up and he looks at you, his relief evident. 'Thank the gods that you aren't who I thought you were. She'd have made me prey,' the satyr mumbles, brushing some of the dirt from his face. You ask him who. 'Artemis, the Mistress of the Hunt and the Maiden Archer,' a feminine voice answers as the woman from before steps through the bushes, now dressed more decently in a short, brown tunic, and glares at the perpetrator. 'Do you really want to take after Aktaion? If you want to join me swimming, ask, but hiding in a bush so you can watch is a good way to have the hounds set upon you,' she chides him. Waiting for a break in the conversation, you ask whether they might perhaps be who you are meant to be meeting about the Third Labor of Herakles, noticing their shoulders sag in relief.";

	say "     'Oh, praise Zeus. We were beginning to wonder if the hydra had returned to finish you off. She has been known to hold a grudge,' the woman exclaims. 'I am Nephele, a nymph in the service of Artemis, and the satyr that you caught spying on meis Abderos, a follower of Dionysus. We have been tasked with aiding you in the labors.' The goat-man gives you a wave and a grin, his confidence returning. 'From what I hear, you're pretty hot stuff when it comes to fighting monsters,' he comments, eyeing you up and down as he does so. 'Defeating the Nemean Lion and the Lernean Hydra are impressive feats, but this next task requires perseverance rather than strength. The Hind of Ceryneia has been lost within this tainted city and the Goddess of the Wilds would have her returned unharmed,' Abderos explains. 'And unspoilt,' Nephele adds, giving you a piercing glance. 'We are well aware of the proclivities of mortals and you are no exception.'";
	say "     You have to concede that point, but that still doesn't explain how you are meant to catch it when you don't even know where it is. 'That's sort of what we are here for,' the nymph responds. '[Bold Type]The hind was last seen here in these woods[Roman Type], so we'll help you track where it has run off to should it escape, but we aren't allowed to directly aid you beyond this.' 'We also aren't going to follow you around if you're off doing other things. We have lives too,' Abderos chips in, his eyes now having strayed to look at Nephele again, though she seems to be oblivious or ignoring him this time. 'We would appreciate it if you abstained from dithering though. We aren't allowed to leave this plane until you do and, as I'm sure you know, this satyr isn't the only one guided by his lusts in the city,' the nymph continues. 'We can talk to you more as we go, but we've been standing around for long enough. Onwards! The hunt awaits!' Nephele cheers, urging you to start your search for the hind before the two of them charge off ahead of you, leaving you to find your own way.";

'Sorry, sorry,' the nymph apologizes on his behalf, seeing your glance in their direction. 'He didn't think that you would be this quick to begin the pursuit and decided that he had time to attend a party at the college. Fortunately, no one thought twice about a satyr wandering around and we can travel quickly when we need to. We frequently end up assigned together like this, and despite our differences Abderos is nearly as capable in the wilds as I am,' Nephele grudgingly compliments him, as he staggers around twigs and branches that might otherwise spook your quarry. 'We should probably keep silent from now on. We're nearing the hind, I can feel it in the wind.' You agree, but not having spoken a word since meeting them, you smirk that it is her who has been the most chatty. As you near a glade, the satyr gestures for you to take cover behind a fallen log and you see the Hind of Ceryneia for the first time.";

The hind is as large as a moose, though it exudes an aura of serenity as it grazes in the clearing, a creature of elegance despite its size. It takes you a moment to notice that its hooves appear to be bronze and you snap your head around to look at your guides in case they have anything to say. 'Don't get kicked,' Abderos advises you, sagely nodding his head as though he has imparted some great wisdom. As you turn back to look at the doe, a loud noise startles you all and an elf woman sprints from the trees opposite you pursued by a knight who is naked from the waist down, his penis flopping around as he runs. 'Cease your flight fair maiden and tend to my sword,' the knight bellows before tripping over a root, giving the elf a chance to dart off to the side and escape. This unfortunately also causes the hind to bolt in the opposite direction, the branches magically parting in its path to allow it passage before closing behind its retreating from, preventing any chance of you catching up to it.";

With a sigh of annoyance, you turn to see what advice Nephele and Abderos can give you only to find the nymph looking absolutely livid. 'That damnable mortal! May the path ever evade him in this forest,' she spits, her companion looking at her uneasily. 'I would take that back. We can find the hind again and the elf escaped unscathed. You know that your words will be heeded if you genuinely mean them, but the gods will ask something in return,' Abderos cautions her, though she remains unmoved. With a sigh the satyr looks over to you. 'Come on, we'll walk with you back to the edge of the woods. We don't want you to end up lost like that knight will surely be and Nephele might have calmed down enough by then to pick up the trail for you.'";
	say "     With little other choice, you readily acquiesce and follow the two of them back the way you came, the nymph muttering darkly under her breath while Abderos strikes up a conversation with you. 'I have to tell you, this city isn't as bad as what I thought it would be. I mean, it would be better if there were more trees, but the majority of people seem to have surrendered to their naturally hedonistic ways,' he says, his earlier tipsiness gone. 'The college was especially pleasant and Lord Dionysus might be interested in making an appearance in one form or another at some of the parties there. I heard that they are planning another big one with everyone invited, but I had to leave before I could find out when.' He continues in this way until you reach the edge of the trees, falling silent when Nephele holds up a hand. Crouching down, she presses a hand into the dirt, sniffs at the air and cocks her head as if listening to something. '[Bold Type]Our quarry heads towards the beach[Roman Type],' she says before trudging off sulkily. 'Please forgive her. She takes pride in her skill at the hunt and likely feels that she has failed you, despite the knight being at fault, not her,' Abderos apologizes. 'I'll try to cheer her up a bit, but don't be surprised if she is desperate to make amends when she next sees you. We'll met you at the beach,' he continues hurriedly before scampering after the nymph, leaving you to decide what to do next.";

Seeing you approaching, the satyr waves you over, a grin spreading across his face. 'Hey there. Listen, I've persuaded these two beautiful women into a threesome, but I doubt that it will take much to make it a foursome instead. Are you interested?' he asks, winking at them and making them giggle. 'Were you planning on abandoning me while I was getting ice cream, or did you forget that we have a responsibility to fulfill before we can engage in such activities?' Turning around, you find Nephele standing there with an icecream in each hand, an eyebrow raised pointedly. 'Well, as I can see that you are busy, I'll just give yours to someone more deserving. Perhaps the hero undergoing the trials? The extra energy will do them good,' she continues, proffering a cone to you while she nibbles on her own. You reflexively take it and begin to lick, inwardly hoping that this isn't going to upset Abderos too much, especially as he now seems torn between the two beautiful women and his friend.";
	say "     With a sigh, he turns to the panther and bunny, 'It will have to be another time ladies. Dionysus wouldn't abandon his duties and neither should I,' he apologizes, the two women blowing him a kiss before bounding away, chattering with each other. 'Cheer up Abderos. Maybe next time Circe will let you buy your own ice cream seeing as you resisted your masculine temptation  this time,' Nephele consolingly says, giving the satyr her own. 'But you've already licked it,' he complains, the nymph rolling her eyes before replying, 'Are you really saying that that is a problem for you? Just think of it like an indirect kiss. I may not be bound by vows of maidenhood, but while I am in the Huntress's service I would not wish to slight her so blatantly.' Conceding her point, Abderos quickly eats the entire thing within seconds, leaving both you and Nephele stunned by this display. 'What? I was hungry, and it tasted like her,' he says defensively, tilting his head towards the nymph and making her scowl and blush. 'Weirdo,' she mutters.";

The three of you make your way past the many other beach-goers, your conversation continuing. 'Hopefully this time there won't be any of those knights, though you'll be pleased to know that my lady Artemis declined to trap him in the forest for all eternity. Recounted a lesson on how being impetuous could ruin the hunt and that I should instead try to find fulfillment in the journey rather than trying to reach completion as expediently as possible. I'm pretty sure that Aphrodite said a similar thing in very different circumstances, but I didn't dare say that to her. Making comparisons between the Olympians can be more dangerous than trying to steal from the Hesperides, but I'm sure that you'll learn that yourself.' The nymph's words concern you, but before you can enquire further she holds up a hand for you to stop and you see the hind at the sea edge being doted over by some naked women. 'Nereids,' Nephele and Abderos say at the same time, though in very different tones.";
	say "     While your female guide almost spits the word out, the satyr instead sounds eager to get to know them, the two women from earlier understandably fresh in his mind. 'Think, Abderos. They are Nereids, whereas I am a dryad,' Nephele grumbles. 'We may as well prepare for having to track the hind again. They aren't malicious, but the nereids will likely warn it of our presence just to be mischievous and because of the rivalry between different nymphs. Just be glad that we haven't run into any maenads. They're much, much more problematic for anyone not following Dionysus. Even Ganymede here wouldn't be able to protect you from them, but I digress. Be prepared for the pursuit to be even longer,' she warns you. Pinching the bridge of her nose in preparation for the sea nymphs['] vexatious behavior, Nephele gestures for you to continue onwards towards your quarry.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Before you can take more than a few steps, one of the nereids spots you and shouts a warning to the hind, 'Run! The hunters close in on you.' Startled, the Ceryneian Hind leaps away, the sand momentarily causing it difficulty before it sprints away over the dunes. Her warning accurate, Nephele half-heartedly kicks some sand towards the giggling women even as Abderos stares dreamily at them. Sticking their tongues out at you, the sea-nymphs prance back into the sea, leaving the three of you standing around with differing emotions towards them. 'At least the view was nice,' the satyr says, flinching slightly at Nephele's sour expression. 'I can't find the silver-lining as easily as you, but I'll try nonetheless,' she mutters, trying to control her disappointment and [']enjoy the journey[']. You, by comparison, are merely resigned to this whole thing taking no more and no less time than the Olympians have decided.";
	say "     Eventually, Nephele stoops down and picks up a twirly shell, peering at it, licking it, and then  holding it up to her ear. 'Judging from the alignment of the waves, [Bold Type]the hind will make her way to the zoo[Roman Type]. Though why she would want to go to such a horrible place, I do not know,' she informs you. Incredulous that she could learn all that from a shell you are about to ask more before Abderos cuts in, 'She's just trying to sound mysterious. She can hear the animals reacting to the deer's arrival.' Feeling a little silly at your momentary naivety, you are nonetheless pleased that she is taking its escape a lot better this time. 'Well, I suppose we'll meet you there again,' the nymph informs you. 'Last one to arrive is spoiled wine,' the satyr adds, dashing away in an attempt at a head start. 'I wouldn't worry about him too much. He'll probably get distracted and try to find those women from earlier,' Nephele confides in you before walking serenely after her friend.";

All around you are the usual cries and calls of animals, varying from sounds of hostility to those of ecstasy. Realizing that you don't know where exactly in the zoo that you were meant to be meeting and that you aren't likely to find the deer without help, you stand around awkwardly and try to concoct a plan. Fortunately, before much time has passed, you hear familiar voices in the midst of an argument. 'I knew that you would get distracted, but by the gods, I didn't expect to have to trail you all over the city as you pursued men, women, and parties,' an exasperated female voice scolds. Turning around, you see Nephele and Abderos approaching, the satyr for the most part ignoring his companions' complaints. 'I'm sure that [SubjectPro of Player] won't be here either. Why don't you save your prickly tongue for [ObjectPro of Player]?' he replies.";
	say "     You call out to them, interrupting their exchange and making them look towards you with surprise. Even more shocking is that Abderos barges in front of the nymph and makes a dash towards you. Unfortunately for him, he manages to tangle his legs together as he does so and ends up sprawled on the ground as Nephele scampers past him and gently pokes your nose before turning back towards him as he hauls himself back to his feet. 'Now, what did we learn?' she mocks him, sticking her tongue out momentarily. 'Also, by your own wager, you are now sour vinegar. I do hope that none of the gods take this too literally,' she continues. 'I said spoiled wine, and of course no-one is going to transform me into it. Anyway, I thought that nymphs were meant to be nice. Your close ties with nature and all that,' the satyr grumbles, brushing himself off as he comes to a stop in front of you.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Surely you're too old to be that naive. Nature is beautiful, not nice, and the two are not the same. Just ask Aphrodite. She has claws. Metaphorically,' Nephele laughs. 'Sometimes a moment of savagery is necessary. Always being kind can get people hurt.' Clearing your throat, you remind them that they are meant to be helping you find the Hind of Ceryneia and that they could well frighten it off with their argument before you even catch sight of it and that you for one would like to complete this trial without needless delays. Both looking suitably chastened, the duo fall silent and instead divert their attention to studying the ground, communicating in hushed tones as they attempt to discern the location of the deer with their primitive yet arcane methods. Eventually, they straighten up and turn to face you. 'The hind is a short distance that way,' Abderos informs you, pointing off to the side. 'We should hurry though. The giants are displeased by her unwillingness to be contained,' Nephele adds.";
	say "     Heeding her words, you set off at a brisk pace in the direction that he has indicated, soon arriving at the edge of an enclosure that has had its bars wrenched apart by some large creature. Looking in, you see a commotion in the opposite corner. A giant seems to have had better luck than you in capturing the hind, though so far success still eludes it, trapping the magnificent creature with its back against the wall, the sacred deer's scything antlers all that is keeping the transformed zookeeper away. 'I know that the labors are meant to be a test, but really?' you hear Abderos mutter before Nephele interjects, 'If we can distract the giant for long enough, maybe even only a few seconds, the hind will be able to escape.' Frowning, you pointedly ask if that isn't counter-intuitive to your own interest in it [italic type]not[roman type] escaping. Looking sympathetic, the nymph replies, 'Sort of. Yes. But I would rather have to search the city again than risk that monster violating an animal sacred to my mistress.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Though you can understand her reasoning, circumstances dictate that you do not get a chance to continue the discussion. Growing impatient with the stubborn beast, the giant swings a meaty fist at the hind, its hand colliding with a swinging antler with a sickening crunch. To your shock and horror, the glistening bone snaps off and drops to the ground as the cervine cries out in pain and fear, though its vocalization is soon drowned out by Nephele's bellow of fury at the harm inflicted upon Artemis's sacred hind. Frantically looking around for some weapon to attack the zookeeper with, she eventually settles for a stone, judging the trajectory within a second before throwing it with more force than you would have expected from someone her size. The resulting impact against the back of the giant's head demonstrates her marksmanship even with her improvised missile and makes you glad that you haven't done anything to earn her ire. Astonished, you watch as the giant crumples to the ground, the Hind of Ceryneia narrowly avoiding being crushed as the giant collapses, pulverizing the wall beneath it's considerable mass.";
	say "     'As much as I would like to take credit, I assure you that wasn't me,' Nephele mumbles as both you and Abderos look at her with fearful awe. However, with the new breach in the enclosure, the deer is able to scamper over the fallen form of the giant and escape again, though it does pause for a moment and almost seems to bow at the three of you before dashing away again. 'I think that she earned that one,' Abderos says, a statement that you have to agree with despite the fact that you'll have to find the beast again. 'As distasteful as it is, I'll be able to track her near perfectly using her broken antler,' the nymph sighs, trudging over to the scene of devastation and locating the appendage, resisting the urge to kick the zookeeper while she is beside him. Barely has she touched the golden antler before she says, 'The park. [Bold Type]The hind has gone to the park to recover[Roman Type].'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Finally airing a thought that had been troubling you for a while, you ask how the creature is able to travel so quickly. 'The simple answer is magic, but I would describe it as more as a divine blessing,' Abderos replies. Continuing on from what the satyr has said, Nephele clarifies further, 'While the two might seem interchangeable to you, Hekate's magic is vastly different to what Artemis or Dionysus can do.' Accepting their explanation, you part ways again after agreeing to meet them in the park, the nymph reverently holding the broken antler before her as she walks away.";

With how they explained the hind's ability to travel so quickly, you assume that it is something similar. Finding a bench in the shadow of a statue to some historical philanthropist, you sit and wait for their inevitable arrival. As expected, you aren't waiting long before the two of them round the corner in the middle of laughing about something. They wave as they approach, still stifling giggles as they walk over to you.

Now, I know what you're thinking. Only an idiot would agree to a drinking contest with a satyr, but here's the thing, they were only going to be drinking water.' The nymph pauses to to take a breath and Abderos continues the story, 'Or to be more accurate, [SubjectPro of Diego] [italic type]thought[roman type] that we were going to drink water and no doubt was thinking of some way to hoodwink me, but a quick prayer to Dionysus and I knew that I wouldn't have any trouble winning. As soon as any liquid entered either of our throats, it changed into strong wine. Needless to say, I have a much better capacity for alcohol than most in your world. Long story short, now [SubjectPro of Diego] is sleeping it off and we were able to meet up with you without any more problems.'";

'Consider yourself forgiven for all those times you watched me bathe,' she giggles while he stands there slack-jawed. 'Now, while he recovers from that, we should get on with finding the hind,' Nephele says, turning to you with a cheeky grin. 'It is likely that she will have gone in search of a source of freshwater, preferably something like a river or a lake. Is there something like that around here?' she continues. Nodding, you mention a decently-sized pond where people used to play in paddle-boats before enquiring as to whether something happened beyond her earlier encounter to cause her good mood, especially when so far your attempts to capture the hind were less than successful, especially in the zoo.";
	say "     With a smile, she explains as the three of you move, 'I took my goddess's advice to see the pursuit as a reward in itself rather than only finding value in it when it is successful. I needed to be reminded that worthy prey that must be stalked is more fulfilling than that which one overcomes immediately. I think that I was paired with Abderos to help me learn this. His carefree approach to life is very different to my own and he seems to find more enjoyment in it than I did with my objective-focused mindset. I'm sure that he can learn from me too, but watching him outwit the coyote earlier made me realize that I frequently underestimate him and that if I want to better serve the Goddess of the Hunt that I need to be less rigid of mind. Now I feel that I can actually enjoy myself a bit more without the fear of it making me a failure.' You have to concede that this sounds like a good reason to be cheerful and congratulate her on her epiphany before the satyr finally finds his tongue and interrupts.";

I just never imagined that you would ever do that. You're going to get in so much trouble,' he hurriedly responds, concern tingeing his voice. 'Maybe a little, but it's not as if I have sworn a vow of abstinence like Artemis. It just felt like the right thing to do in the moment,' the nymph mumbles, blushing. Though they both fall silent, you imagine that they will be discussing this in private for quite some time. As the pond comes into view, you get the impression that something is very wrong despite the apparent peace that hangs around the water. 'Perhaps she found a stream somewh-?' Abderos begins to suggest, but cuts himself off mid-sentence noticing something by the shoreline, rushing over to look more closely. 'Oh. Well that complicates things,' he mutters before straightening up again and turning to you. 'The hind has been taken by centaurs,' he informs you and causing Nephele to grind her teeth together beside you.";
	say "     'How I wish more centaurs were like Chiron,' she laments. 'Well, I'm sure that you know where we have to go next. I thought that the creatures in your city usually stayed in their own territories, but I suppose I was mistaken.' Asking whether it is possible that actual centaurs rather than those infected by nanites took the sacred hind, both the satyr and the nymph shake their heads. 'They wouldn't dare. At least the ones from our realm. Not if they didn't want to end up hunted in turn by my goddess,' Nephele explains, Abderos nodding in agreement. 'No. They are most likely from one of the tribes on the [bold type]Dry Plains[roman type]'. Reluctantly accepting that your hunt has been extended even more, you enquire as to where to meet them once you get there. 'What we've been doing so far has worked hasn't it?' Abderos teases you, Nephele managing a small smile before returning to her concerned expression.

'We decided that it might be easier for you if we could tell you which centaur tribe you needed to bring down the wrath of the Huntress upon, so we did some scouting and can take you to them. We would have rescued the Hind ourselves, but as your third labor is as of yet incomplete, we were forbidden from doing so. My lady was not pleased...' she continues, shuddering with what you assume are memories of Artemis's displeasure.

'I apologize, but it has to be a direct strike. Artemis wants her deer safe again, but isn't allowed to send a hunting party to do so due to the pact between the many different gods and goddesses that have taken an interest in your city. You can imagine how messy it would get if they all took a direct hand in influencing the city.

I plan on punishing these savages with as much prejudice as is possible with blunt weapons. No one escapes the reach of the Huntress,' Nephele says with considerable relish. You are soon left all alone, waiting for some sign that you should move on the barn, aware that the scheme relies more on good fortune than meticulous planning. Technically, all that is required of you is to reach the barn, get inside, and release the Hind and any other prisoners that you can. After that you'll have to trust in the gratitude of the beast that you have relentlessly pursued around the city, a factor that seems like it would play more into forming a grudge than any desire to help you, but you must admit that your guides haven't led you astray yet.";

Though it bounces off, no doubt due to non-lethal modifications to her ammunition, the centaur staggers a bit slowly crumples to the ground a moment before the commotion explodes into its full glory. Whoops, jeers, and shouts fill the camp, and no doubt much of the surrounding area, as arrows and stones fly through the air and the centaurs gallop around in an attempt to subdue the interlopers as they duck and weave among tents and supplies.

Fortunately, you manage to slip inside without raising the alarm, catching sight of the satyr vainly attempting to steer a centaur while riding on its back before closing the large door behind you. At least he seemed to be enjoying himself as usual. Turning around you find yourself being watched by more than one pair of wide eyes, Nephele's suspicions of there being multiple prisoners being held here being proven correct. Though at first glance you don't see the Hind, there are a couple of female centaurs in one stall, a trussed-up horseman in a corner, and a pair of bruised soldiers huddled together in a cage.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     None of them make any attempt to call for the guards despite how you have obviously unauthorized entry, suggesting that not even the centaur mares are willing occupants here, the horseman directing an especially desperate expression towards you. As you take a few steps further, you catch sight of the Hind behind a dividing wall, her missing antler particularly distinctive. A multitude of ropes keep her restrained and bound to rings on the wall, though she seems otherwise unsullied, missing antler excluded. The deer eyes you warily but otherwise makes no attempt to struggle against her bonds as you hurry over to her. Laying a reassuring hand on her side you gently explain that you are here to free her, sensing that a calming approach is best, your instinct rewarded when she dips her head and allows you easier access to the ropes that encircle her head and shoulders.";
	say "     Each minute that passes as you tease at the knots and loosen her restraints drags on, fears of what is happening outside and that the guards might soon return gnawing at the back of your mind. Nonetheless, you resolutely continue, the knowledge that should you fail that your new friends['] sacrifice would be for nothing. Finally, after what feels like an hour but may be as little as five minutes, the Hind of Ceryneia is freed from her bondage, the large cervine stamping her bronze hooves as she enjoys her mobility again. Taking pity on the other prisoners and without a moment to lose, you rush over to them in turn, their own salvation taking much less time as you fling open the gate of the mare's stall, directing them to untie the horseman while you unlock the soldier's cage with a key hanging on the wall. With everyone free you prepare yourselves for escaping the centaur tribe's camp.";

	say "     'Technically, your labor could be considered complete,' says a serene voice behind you. Startled, your little group, bar the hind, spins around to see a pale-skinned young woman with silver hair stepping out from behind a pile of hay-bales, the doe instead running over to the mysterious figure. She is dressed in a brown and green tunic that stops just short of her knees with a silvery bow and quiver on her back, though you still get the impression that she would be able to draw and loose an arrow at you within the fraction of a heartbeat should she wish to. Briefly regarding you keenly with soulful gray eyes, she soon redirects her attention towards the deer as it comes to a stop before her and kneels down, a warm smile spreading across her face as she runs her hand over its face. 'I am Artemis and I thank you for rescuing my hind. While usually a gentle creature, the centaurs have earned her ire as well as my own so I shall allow her to repay your kindness despite having accomplished the labor that you were tasked with. I shall speak with you again soon.' As quickly as she appeared, the goddess vanishes again, her words confusing the centaur mares, soldiers, and horseman.";
	say "     Before you get the chance to explain, the barn door is hurled open and a particularly muscular centaur recoils in surprise at finding you standing before them. 'How the fuck did you get in here?' he spits, hefting a leather whip in one hand. 'Pah. Doesn't take much to guess that you're with those two assholes that are messing up the camp. Mo matter, your rescue attempt stops here and I'll make you into a fuck slave just like these other bitches even if I have to beat the resistance out of you.' With the soldiers in no fit shape to fight back, and the centaur mares cowering away, it would seem that it is up to you, the horseman, and the sacred deer to see this slaver off, the situation worsening when eight more centaurs appear behind him, readying lassoos and clubs. Such a shame that Artemis couldn't have stayed around just a little longer...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Any concern that you might have had quickly fades away as the Hind of Ceryneia charges right past you and into the middle of the group of centaurs, scything her antler back and forth. Despite having only one antler, the doe's superior size and the ferocity with which she swings her head around soon puts the centaurs to flight sporting bruises and gashes, vengeance for their crimes against the Goddess of the Hunt's sacred animal. Within seconds, only the leader remains, lying on the ground groaning and flinching back again each time he attempts to stand again as the hind stomps a bronze hoof towards him, making you wonder how weakened she must have been for the centaurs to capture her in the park. With one last glare at the fallen slaver, the deer makes her escape closely followed by the other captives and you, your group only stopping when you are a considerable distance from the encampment.";
	say "     You are slightly disappointed, but nonetheless understanding, when none of them except the hind remain around for long, thanking you with sincerity before dashing off across the plains in different directions whether it is to return to their own herd, military camp, or humble abode. The two of you don't remain alone for long, the familiar figures of Nephele and Abderos soon rejoining you, a suspicious bag that clinks whenever he moves slung over Abderos['] shoulder. 'What? I'm allowed to take loot, aren't I?' he says defensively when you raise an eyebrow at him, the nymph giggling at this exchange. 'I'd have allowed you to take even more,' a voice says behind you, making you flinch. You turn to find Artemis scratching the hind under her chin, though she does have the decency to dip her head in apology at startling you.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'I suppose that I'll have to accept the rescue of their prisoners and the looting of their alcohol as the extent of my vengeance towards their tribe. A shame, but perhaps a more healthy outcome for all those involved,' she muses as she moves her hand up to caress the top of the doe's head where she is missing an antler. Miraculously, as she rubs, the bone begins to regenerate at an astonishing rate, the damage soon becoming but a memory. You can't help but join Nephele and Abderos as they smile at this feat of healing, though they no doubt knew that the goddess was capable of it. 'Would you like a chance to bid farewell to the hind before I return her back to my personal forests?' Artemis asks you, stepping aside as you reply in the affirmative. The deer lenas into your palm as you gently stroke the side of her face, admiring her antlers as you do so.";
	say "     Stepping back again, you watch the deer, waiting for it to fade away or vanish in a flash of light. However, you eventually are forced to blink and when you open your eyes, the doe is gone and the Huntress is looking at you rather smugly. 'Sometimes subtlety is better,' she confides. 'Now, I'm sure that you are waiting for your reward for completing this labor and are unlikely to accept that the real treasure was the friends that you made along the way, so I won't make you wait any longer. And before you ask, no. You may not have sex with the hind. She's been through enough. If Nephele could please hand me the broken antler that she had been keeping safe for me, I will bless it and grant you my boon.' The nymph produces the antler from the folds of her tunic somehow and passes it to her goddess, though you do see a small amount of disappointment on her face. 'Cheer up young one. You and Abderos will receive your own rewards later, though perhaps I should still turn you into a bear for kissing him,' Artemis teases, relenting when she sees Nephele's expression turn to terror. 'As you said, you aren't sworn to abstinence nor did you attempt to hide this from me, so you need not fear punishment. Perhaps I should work on my humor...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Running her fingers over the antler, marvelous images of hunting are left behind etched into the bone with hounds running at the heels of the masters while stags bound and birds take flight. With the scene completed, the antler begins to shrink in the goddess's hands until it is small enough to fit in the palm of her hand. 'I thought that it would be easier for you to store like this,' she explains as she offers you your prize. Looking at it, you cautiously ask whether it is a protective charm or merely a momento. 'Mostly it's a momento, but I decided to give it a little inspiration from those abominable nanites infesting your city. If you rub it, it will transform you into a doe, or stag, just like my hind. It will even resist other transformations and bolster your essence beyond what the majority of nanites can do,' Artemis replies almost boastfully. 'If you get tired of looking like that, just rub the antler again. It will make you human again, but of course you are free to resume mingling with the animals should you wish.'";
	say "     'I think that I have explained what I need to. Someone will find you at the library when we are ready for you to complete the next task. I wish you well until we meet again, though I do not have the gift of prophecy to guess when that might be. Most are not too distraught to see me leave, so I doubt that it will be too troubling for you. You may be pleased to know that Nephele and Abderos will likely be assisting you again in future with some of the other labors should you continue to excel. Good luck,' Artemis states, standing aside to allow the nymph and satyr to say their own goodbyes. 'It was a pleasure to hunt with you and I look forward to assisting you again,' Nephele says, hugging you and causing the goddess to roll her eyes good-naturedly. 'Maybe next time we can meet up at a party,' Abderos adds, he too giving you a hug as the nymph steps out of the way. Your farewells said, you stow the hind's antler in your backpack and watch as the they walk away, wondering when you will next see them, hoping that it will be sooner rather than later.";
