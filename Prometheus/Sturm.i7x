'She may have had a few words about it, yes, but I am genuinely grateful. I seem to have been wrong about you. Mom may be a little too trusting at times, but she is also a lot better than most at seeing the good in people. I guess she was right in your case.' Pleased with your son's progress you give him a hug, enjoying the warmth that radiates from his fluffy body.

While you try to move yourself enough to get a good look at who is, you hear his heartbeat rise a little as a familiar voice commands, 'Stop struggling and listen, because this is hard for me to say and important that you listen.' Sturm loosens his bear hug which gives enough leeway to look at his expression, usually cold and stern, instead reminding you of Blanche as he continues, 'Considering how you were never around I had honestly thought that there wasn't much difference between you and the infected that wandered the city; only looking for a reliable source of pleasure.' While his grip never wavered, his voice did, whether from remembering the Office Den or thinking of his new life at the Library, you can't tell.";

'I realize now after seeing the Library and your willingness to let others stay here that you are a lot more like Mom than I had thought, so I want to apologize for the way I have acted towards you and hope that with this we can start over by treating each other as family.' Obviously done he looks at you, nervously expectant of your answer. Having heard Sturm's apology and his willingness to accept you, you can't help but smile and return the hug that he has been giving you for a while now. The wordless actions eliciting happy tail wagging from Sturm as he realizes that you aren't holding his hostility against him, though the hug ends up lasting for quite some time before you finally both return to your usual antics.";

	say "     You spot Sturm and Blanche at their usual table, setting up a game of chess. As your son sees you approach, he waves to you, drawing his mother's attention to your arrival. 'Hello, mon chéri. Have you come to join us? Did you want me to let you play Sturm instead of me?' she asks, standing up to give you a kiss on the cheek. 'Afraid that I'll finally beat you, Mommy?' the male wolf teases. 'Sorry. It would seem that I need to remind our son not to mess with his mother. He used to be such a nice boy...' she mock-laments. 'I play as white, of course. We argued a bit when we first played, but he couldn't say no to Mommy forever.' You realize that you haven't had a proper look at the chess set, other than the wood-and-marble box. Both the black and white pieces are exquisitely carved in the shape of wolves, and you can't help but notice some similarity between the white queen and Blanche, though that may just be your imagination. 'I got it from that strange jackal's shop. Don't ask what it cost. It's rude to discuss such things,' the matriarch explains as she makes the opening move.";
	say "     As they play, it doesn't take you long to see the difference in their strategies. Sturm seems reluctant to lose any of his pieces, forgoing taking his mother's pieces if it would mean that he would lose any in return, even if it would be considered a good trade. Blanche seems to know this and exploits it, quickly putting her son in a disadvantageous position, deftly making her pieces fulfill their potential before they can be taken. By the time she has Sturm in checkmate, she may have lost most of her pieces, but she has three queens. 'I don't feel that I'm good at this,' Sturm mutters dejectedly, though he still begins to set up for another game. 'You don't seem to care who you lose...' 'Before we start again, would you mind if we discussed it?' Blanche asks him, comfortingly stroking the back of his hand. 'Ok, I suppose.' 'You're looking at your pieces the same way that you look at your me, your brothers, your sisters, and, to a lesser extent, your [BlancheMomDadTitle]. I'm certainly very grateful for how protective you are of us, but chess is a game. The purpose is to win, and to have fun, within the rules.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'When it comes to real life, I hold no such compunction. To protect those I love, I will bribe, brutalize, and do whatever is necessary to protect those I love, something that I'm sure that you can relate to. You are not pieces on a board for me to exploit. You are my ends and my all. [if hunger of Alexandra is 1]Don't tell Alexandra, but i[else]I[end if]f there is no other way to ensure your safety, I will break whatever rules I deem necessary, consequences to me be damned.' You don't believe that you've seen this side of Blanche before, the wolfess gripping the queen tightly in one hand. Seeing your look of shock, her face softens. 'My children may take after me more than you realize,' she says softly, squeezing your hand affectionately before turning back to her son. 'I notice that you've warmed up to your [BlancheMomDadTitle] recently, and I assume that you now consider them part of the family, correct?' Sturm nods. 'Good. I thought it best if you two found your own way to something more than coexistence, but there were a few times when I thought that I would have to mediate,' Blanche gently scolds him.";
	say "     'But enough serious talk. Do you understand what you need to do to get better at chess?' she asks him. 'Yes, Mommy. Separate reality from the game,' Sturm replies, his tail wagging a little. 'Good boy. Who's my favorite puppy?' Blanche praises him. Curious, you interject and ask why Sturm is her favorite, especially when she has so many children. She blushes a little, opening her mouth to reply before closing it again and looking thoughtful. 'It's just something that she says,' Sturm cuts in. 'Wendis asked her in the past and she said that we each have something about us that makes us her favorite.' 'I don't love any of them less than the others, so it is impossible to have a favorite,' Blanche joins in. 'I just say it to Sturm the most as he needs to hear it most. I don't blame you, and I don't think that he does any more, but he took your absences when he was growing up rather hard and at times needed to be reassured that he mattered. It is probably my biggest failure as a mother for not discussing this with you at the time, and for that I am sorry. To both of you,' she apologizes, grasping each of you by the hand.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'He's also the only one to have been in a situation where I had to be actively protected, not counting that mess in the park,' Blanche adds, her tone forcibly light. Frowning, you ask whether she would mind elaborating. 'You know how I usually stayed at the den while my children went scavenging?' You nod. 'I persuaded him to let me accompany him and Bianca. Once. We split up to search some houses and I got ambushed by some horrifying creature. It was covered in black chitin and had huge claws and teeth. Have you ever met anything like that in the city? Well, anyway, I screamed and tried to spray it with pepper-spray, but it did nothing other than make it angrier and it leapt at me. I froze. I couldn't think of anything other than that I might die, but Sturm pushed me out of the way and the thing crashed into him instead. I'll spare you the details, but he was quite injured by the time Bianca arrived and we managed to drive it off. I think that he gave as good as he got, but thank goodness for the nanites['] ability to mend... I'm sure that the others would have probably done the same, but he put himself in harm's way for me. I [italic type]know [roman type]how far he will go to protect us.'";
	say "     Blanche looks a little drained from the memory, resting her head against your shoulder when you give her a hug. 'I don't go out on scavenging trips any more. A few times wandering around as a family, but nothing that leaves me by myself in enclosed spaces. I also don't use pepper-spray anymore,' she says, briefly producing a Taser from gods know where. 'Much more effective.' You would imagine so. 'Now, unless you wish to take mine or Sturm's place, would you mind if we were allowed to focus on that instead? Dividing my attention might earn you points with him, especially if he won, but I would then have to find a way to get even,' Blanche teases, changing the subject back to the game at hand. While you are tempted to try your hand at chess against one of them, you decide that you'll leave them in peace for now. 'Maybe next time, [BlancheMomDadTitle],' Sturm says, before focusing on his opening move.";
