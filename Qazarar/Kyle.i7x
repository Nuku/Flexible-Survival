'My name is Kyle, and I'm something of a regular here.' He pauses, and looks slightly lizardman-ish for a moment.

	say "     Kyle seems to perk up when you acquiesce. 'Excellent. Well, follow me, please.' The lizardman leads you past the rows bookshelves into an area further back in the store. He stops, and you notice an unremarkable door you hadn't paid any attention to before. 'Just through here. I've known the owner for a while now, and she usually lets me use the back room for any more serious efforts. Less chance of me cluttering up the aisles in here that way, I'm sure.' He smiles before opening the door, and stepping through. A moment later, you follow, into a cozy looking back room. The room is fairly small, but has smaller bookshelves lining one wall, and a table with comfortable chairs set up in the middle. Atop the table are several books stacked on top of each other, and even more scattered open alongside papers and notebooks. Looks like somebody has used the table for an intense studying session lately. 'So this is where I spend a lot of my time around here. Go on, have a seat. I don't mind.'";
	say "     You take a seat at the table, and on the opposite side, Kyle does the same. 'Well, like I already told you, my name is Kyle. Before all of this happened,' he says, gesturing broadly outward, 'I was just living in the city, getting by with part time jobs after I graduated from Tenvale. I was an English major, if you were wondering. In my free time, I was trying to write a novel, and make a career as a writer. This whole mess shot that down somewhat, though I'm not giving up completely.' He pauses, and looks more intently at you. 'And what about you? What's your story?' You take a few moments and summarize your experience to Kyle. 'That sounds like quite the experience, friend. I'm glad you came into the store, and that we had this talk. If you ever want to talk more, just stop by, and we can come back here again.' After your conversation, both you and Kyle leave the back room, returning to the bookstore.";

After that I spent a while working various small jobs while trying to write my novel. I was mostly just stable while doing that, at least until the world basically ended. That was definitely something.' Kyle pauses for a moment, and moves a few books around. 'I thought it was just a normal day, and I'd been looking a few things up in the library for reference. On my way back from the library though, that's when it all started. Everything was going crazy, people transforming around me, it was a disconcerting time. I ran back to my apartment to try and get away from it, and was lucky enough to make it there safely. But when I got there, that luck ran out. I opened my door and was attacked by what I suspect used to be my pet snake.";
	say "     He pauses his story, and gestures down at himself. 'It wasn't long until I looked like this. Thankfully I'd read enough apocalyptic novels to have the idea to take refuge at the mall, and managed to get here safely before I had a minor breakdown.' Kyle shuffles around some of the papers in front of him before continuing. 'Besides, I've made out a lot better than some. I'm still mostly humanoid, I have my sanity, and my eyes work perfectly now.' He taps one of his scaled fingers against his glasses. 'These are actually plain glass lenses. I only wear them because I feel strange without them. Plus, they look great on me.' He grins at you. 'So that's my story, far as I can remember.'";

Most of my inquiry has been about other places with books, since I've been focusing on my novel. The mall you're familiar with, at this point. It's a fairly safe place to spend time, and much more collected than most of the city. The bookstore certainly doesn't hurt, which is the main reason I spend so much time here. I've heard a bit about the central library from some of the others here, and I know that isn't somewhere I want to go right now, since it's apparently locked down tight, and in a more dangerous area than the mall.' He shudders briefly, interrupting his own speech.";
	say "     'I'm not much one for fighting, so I don't stray far. I did go with a few others once and took a look at Tenvale, which was... safer, certainly, but it was still a bit much for me. Certainly too much going on to effectively focus on anything. Slightly more hopeful were other bookshops in the city, though I haven't braved them myself. Sometimes my friend Gerty will make expeditions to bookstores in the city to get more books, though.'";
	say "     'So, what about you? What sort of sights have you seen in the city?' Kyle looks at you questioningly. You spend several minutes telling him about the strange things you have seen and encountered in the city since you emerged from your bunker. He looks at you interestedly when you finish. 'Wow, that's some pretty impressive stuff. If I need some serious adventuring done, I'll have to call you. Next time you see something neat, you'll have to come and tell me. Maybe it'll give me some ideas.'";

I've been working on it since my senior year at Tenvale, in bits and pieces. After I graduated, I spent most of my free time working on it or researching for it. I was actually trying to look into publishers for it when all of this went down. Sadly, I lost a lot of my work when I came here. I remember what happened, but without those details, I'm having to rewrite and redraft a lot of work. I'm not going to let a simple apocalypse stop me from finishing this book. Besides, I can just self-publish it if necessary, I'm sure. And that's why I spend so much of my time here in the back of the bookshop, really. Outside is alright, but in here I have real room to work and focus. Beverly is just as excited for me to finish as I am, I think, which is one reason she lets me use this.'";
	say "     'And the other step to help my novel flourish is my friend Gerty, who volunteered to do illustrations for it. His ability to do so even after the disaster is impressive indeed.' He looks directly at you for a moment. 'Maybe some of your experiences will make it into the final draft. Either way, you'll be one of the first to get a copy, friend.' Kyle then spends a few minutes showing you a few excerpts from his works, which were scattered amidst the papers in front of you, and getting your opinion on them.

When he was changed in the disaster, he ended up without arms. Instead he worked with an acquaintance of his to design some prosthetic limbs he could still manipulate, and even though it's barely been any time, he can already handle himself about as well as he could before.'

Wasting no time, you grab the side of the waistline and yank, lowering his pants just enough that his now-hard member becomes partially visible.

'Okay, I'll admit, this whole situation is pretty funny.' He looks down at you and the pile you're laying on. 'Though maybe we got slightly out of hand. Next time we'll have to be more careful.' Kyle stands up, and reaches down to pull you up with him. 'And there's definitely going to be a next time, love. That was fantastic, believe me.' The lizardman suddenly leans forward and kisses you.

Soon he shifts forward, and engulfs your dick in his reptilian mouth, starting to bob up and down, adding to the sensation offered by his skilled tongue.

You don't leave it alone to do so, however, as you drop to your knees in front of him, and grasp it in your hand.

After a short while of this, you pull off of his cock, and instead transition to licking up and down the sides, letting your tongue run along the unique shape of his shaft. As you do this, you look up from your task, and once again meet Kyle's eyes, seeing that behind his glasses, they're intently focused on you, and your actions.

Your other hand reaches up to fondle the lizard balls hanging under the shaft you're swallowing, adding to your performance. Your efforts are clearly working, as you can hear Kyle moaning above you now, audibly enjoying the results of your labor. At this point you can taste not only the dry scent of his cock, but also the flavor of precum on the back of your tongue, letting you know just how close he is.";

His eyes are closed, and his face relaxed in pleasure, showing you the fruits of your labors. After a few more pulses, the flow of cum eventually stops. You pull off of his cock, giving it a single lick, before standing up and locking eyes with Kyle. He's still panting slightly, but you can see how satisfied he is. Before you have a chance to say anything however, he kisses you passionately.";

You can feel his ring sliding down around your shaft, gripping you tightly as you sink deeper into him. After what seems like an eternity, he comes to a stop, sitting back on your lap again, the few inches change making all the difference in the world.

Time seems to get away from you, blurring into a sexual haze as Kyle continues to ride your cock like there's no tomorrow. Eventually the growing pleasure begins to surge, cutting through the haze, and bringing the scene back into sharp clarity just as you start to come. Your erection throbs, and you can feel yourself releasing deep into Kyle, as he holds himself pressed down all the way, taking your shaft completely. As you cry out in orgasm, Kyle follows soon after, his member jerking and firing spurts of seed across each of your chests.";

I'd probably be a bit more verbose about it, but I don't think I'll be able to concentrate properly for a while yet.' He laughs. 'Anyway, can't wait to do this again, so come back soon, okay?'

	say "     You tell Kyle that you're fine with staying in the mall, and spending some time with him there. He smiles in response. 'It may not be the most spectacular, but hey, it'll be a pretty great date no matter what, as long as we're spending it together, right?' You nod at Kyle in affirmation. 'Great. Now, I've spent enough time here to know my way around fairly well, so come on. I'll give you a tour.' For the next while, Kyle leads you around the mall, showing you the various points of interest, and telling you things about them that only a mall local would know. Some time is spent at the various mall stores that are still functional, browsing collections, discussing items, and generally having an enjoyable time. Finally, the two of you come back to the atrium of the mall, and the two of you sit in the center, looking at the fountain. Though it's now just a stagnant pool of water, you can still see clearly how it used to look.";
	say "     As the two of you lean into each other in front of the fountain, Kyle speaks. 'Hey, I had a really good time, even without leaving the mall. Spending time with you is nice, and I'd definitely like to do it more.' Kyle looks away from the still water of the fountain, and meets your gaze. 'I think that I'm ready for this to be a relationship, now. I was nervous before, I'd never really done anything of the sort. Always too much of an introvert, never looked very hard. But this? This is good. I definitely want to do this again.' Kyle's voice is somewhat tense, a measure of nervous energy putting him on edge. You smile at the lizardman, agreeing on may of those points. Rather than let him engage further in his nervous speech, however, you answer him affirmatively, by leaning forward and catching his lips with a kiss.";

	say "     As the kiss goes on, Kyle relaxes, and leans further into you. After a short while, you finally break apart to breathe properly, and Kyle smiles. 'Well, I suppose I can take that as an agreement, can't I? Well, I may have said it already, but it bears saying again. The date was wonderful, and you were wonderful. I'm glad we did it, and I can't wait for more.' Kyle suddenly shoots forwards and gives you a hug. 'I'll see you soon, I hope, back at the shop, love. Oh, that sounds great. Love. Anyway, even the best date has to end somewhere, so see you later, love.' Kyle stands up and walks back towards the east wing of the mall, leaving you sitting by the fountain in the atrium, enjoying the warm feeling you still have.";

You reassure him that you know what you're doing, and that you'll make sure to protect him while you're there. He looks slightly worried, but nods regardless. 'Alright. I trust you. Let's go to the park, then.' You spend a short while escorting Kyle to the park, avoiding confrontations with several ferals along the way. Finally you both arrive, safely at the entrance to the city park.";
