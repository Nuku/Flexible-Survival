		say "     Zeke looks visibly delighted that you took him up on his offer. 'Hey, glad you came.' He then gestures broadly around the room. 'As you can see, I have a very nice setup here, and a lot of games to choose from. Since I don't have enough of an idea of what you like to know where we can really cut loose, I figure we should start with something pretty broadly fun, yeah? Make sure we both have a good time and all.' He steps towards one of the several shelves around the room, and spends several moments scanning across the titles it holds, before selecting one. 'Zephyr Kart 8, almost guaranteed to be fun for anyone regardless of skill. There are few better places to start. Shall we?'";
		say "     In no time at all, the two of you are seated among the collection of comfortable chairs and beanbags set up in an arc before his TV. With a practiced hand, he quickly sets up the game system, and before you know it, the title screen is displaying, and you're ready to play. Once the game begins, you can see that Zeke has spent a lot of time playing, as his skills are rather impressive. On the other hand, you're somewhat out of practice, with the situation being as it is, but you don't do too badly yourself, coming out just well enough to not feel bad about your own performance.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Once the two of you have completed several games, and spent the better part of an hour playing, and occasionally trash talking, you finally call it good for the moment. As Zeke put away the game, he comments on your performance. 'Hey, for someone without a fortified game basement, you weren't half bad. Once you get a little more practice playing against me, with a few more games, you'll be almost as good as me. Almost.' You shake your head, and tell him that you'll get good enough to beat him eventually. He chuckles in response. 'If that's your goal, you're definitely going to need to come over and play more games. I'm always up for more, so feel free to stop on by whenever.'";

Other than that though, I don't get out much, just stay here where it's relatively safe, and very comfortable. But it can get kind of lonely at times, with nobody to really hang out with.

At the moment I have plenty of fuel, hopefully enough to last until somebody fixes the power.

You break the stillness first, moving right up against the fox, until you stand a scant few inches away. Slowly, you press up against him, until your cock is pressed up against his shaft. Then Zeke begins to reciprocate your motions, and presses back against you as well, the combined motion causing a slight friction as your dicks start to rub against each other, a sense of warm pleasure beginning to build up.";

At the same time, your hands drift downward, joining the mess of pleasure below, adding stroking and tugging to the rubbing sensations. You can feel the veins of his knot against your own member, and the feeling of them in contact with you finally pushes you over the edge. Your cock begins to jerk as you feel the pleasure peaking and flowing, shots of seed splashing over the both of you. Immediately following your own climax, Zeke's dick erupts as well, adding more semen to the mess.

But anything more serious than this, you'll have to try your luck with some competition. The reward is more fun with a risk.' He follows up his comment by winking at you, before he settles down into one of the beanbags, legs spread, and the slowly hardening cock beginning to stand free. You step over to Zeke, and then fall to your knees in front of him, bringing your eyes level with his vulpine dick. For a moment, you sit there, your eyes following the slight twitches of the shaft before you. Eventually the temptation becomes too much for you to wait any longer, and you lean forward, capturing it in your mouth.";

You glance upwards, and can see Zeke panting in pleasure from your ministrations. A few seconds after, he meets your eyes, and grins at you. 'You're, ah, pretty good at this. You must have played a lot of games when you were younger, gotten a lot of practice at cartridge blowing.' He smiles at his own joke, but you simple keep at work, ignoring his terrible sense of humor. Soon enough, your efforts bear fruit, and you can feel his member pulse in your mouth, and start releasing your reward. You take your head down his shaft and hold it in place with your mouth just meeting his knot, and let his seed fill you. Far too soon, it comes to an end, and you swallow, before licking his cock clean, and leaning back. Your eyes meet his again, and he smiles at you as you stand back up.";

Deciding to move first, you lay yourself down on the couch. You start stroking your member lightly, building it up towards full hardness, and give the fox your best inviting look.

Soon enough, you can feel that your task is nearing completion, clearly evidenced by the way his shaft is starting to twitch and pulse in your mouth.

After several moments of his cum shooting into you, the same release happens to you, with your own cock firing off jets of semen into the fox's mouth. Your lower body involuntarily jerks upwards slightly as this matching pair of orgasms flows between the two of you, the electric senses of pleasure seeming to connect you in a continuous circuit. After a time, however, the sensation fades, and you are left with the fox laying comfortably atop your body, and the two of you remain lying in comfort for several more minutes.

You spend several more moments stroking your member to full hardness, making sure you're ready to act. You barely give him any time to adjust before you start using him, practically slamming your cock into his mouth.

Once he seems to be ready to take your full length, however, you thrust in fully, sinking your shaft into his throat.";

You can feel the tight seal his mouth makes around you, accompanied by the very audible noises made by your thrusts. The pleasure begins to build, and you can feel the wave rising, and your speed increasing until it eventually peaks. You thrust in as far as you are able, hilting yourself, with your balls resting on his face, and you release. Your cock throbs, and unleashes a stream of spunk into the fox's mouth, quickly filling him.

A thrill runs through you at the knowledge of what is about to happen, knowledge that is confirmed further as you feel the vulpine cock come to rest on top of your ass, moving back and forth ever so slightly. You feel a warmth on your back as the fox leans further over you, his chest pressed against your back. A shift in the position of his member, bringing the tip to a stop right up against your hole, tells you exactly what comes next.";

For several moments, he holds that position, his cock stretching you open, but as intense as the sensations flooding through you are, this is only the beginning. The fox starts pumping in and out, his cock ending up deeper inside you on each thrust, stretching you yet further. Once he gets even deeper in you, his thrusts are enough that his knot begins to collide with your ass on each thrust.

There is no hesitation in your mind, and you immediately begin begging for him to fuck you. The fox doesn't answer you, but his response is still clear, as he resumes his earlier work even more energetically than before. You gasp in shock and pleasure as he immediately begins hammering you, and sinks his entire shaft into you in one swift thrust, only straining for a moment before the knot pops into you as well.";

Soon a fresh warmth lets you know that Zeke has hit a pleasured peak as well, with his cock pulsing inside you and releasing its payload. That is the final thing to push you over the edge, and the strength of that pleasure is enough that you almost feel about to pass out. In the end, however, you hang on, simply in a pleasurable daze, until finally the two of you have finished. The fox cleans everything up as you lay over the edge of the couch, recovering from the act. When he's finished with that, he comes back over to you. 'You were quite the ride there, weren't you?

	move player to Game Store;
	say "     As you enter the game shop, you notice that there is someone else browsing the shelves, currently leaning over and unintentionally showing off a fluffy tail poking out through a hole in a pair of jeans. After a few moments of watching it swish around, he stands up, a case in hand, and turns away from the shelf. Now that he is fully visible, you can see that he is clearly a fox, albeit on two legs, and in addition to a pair of jeans is wearing a slightly worn shirt displaying the text <MESSAGE REDACTED>. When he realizes that you're there, he starts briefly, and then speaks. 'Oh, hey. You here for some games too? Wait, that's a silly question. Why else would you be in the game shop, after all?'";
	say "     The fox takes a momentary pause, and extends his hand. 'I'm Zeke, by the way. And you are?' You shake his hand, and introduce yourself. 'Well, nice to meet you. You might have guessed, but I tend to play a lot of video games. Even with this whole disaster going on, I still have a pretty nice setup. If you ever want to hang out and play some games, you should visit. I haven't had a lot of opportunity for anything multiplayer lately, and it's nice to have a little variety. Plus, I don't know why, but you seem to me like the sort of person who enjoys video games. Actually, hang on a moment.' Zeke takes off a backpack, which you hadn't noticed he was wearing, and puts the game he was carrying into it. Then he digs out a scrap of paper and scribbles something on it, before handing it to you. It seems to contain directions. 'Now you should be able to find my place, when you want. See you around, I hope.' With that the fox picks up his backpack, and leaves the store.";

Game Store is a room.
The description of Game Store is "     The store is almost nothing but shelves and shelves full of games and game accessories. There are plenty of places that have been cleaned out on the shelves, but for the most part it all still seems to be there. It seems there have been other priorities to collecting video games.".
Mall East Wing is north of Game Store.
