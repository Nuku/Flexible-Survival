However, when you step into the main area, you can't see any such creature in the space by the display. For a moment you're confused, wondering where something so large could have hidden, but then you see that there's a small table set up in the corner, almost hidden by shelves, and seated at the table is a large minotaur. Contrary to what you would expect from such a tall and dangerous looking creature, this minotaur is carefully perched in his chair, taking care not to break any of the dishes around him as he slowly turns the pages of a book. Further, he is attired in something one would expect more out of an eccentric uncle or university professor than a savage beast, with a pair of slacks sized for his frame, a collared shirt that seems fit to burst from trying to contain his musculature, and to top it all off, a pair of reading glasses resting on his nose.";
		say "     Your surprise leaves you waiting for several moments, reeling slightly from the sight before you. The pause is long enough that the minotaur has a chance to look up from his book and notice you. His eyes widen in matching surprise, before he starts to compose himself. 'Oh, I didn't realize anyone else was here.' He fidgets around slightly. 'Normally I'm the only person to come in here, nowadays. There aren't really any sort of supplies, but I think it's very peaceful. Reminds me of simpler times, you know?' He gives a somewhat awkward smile. 'Well, I suppose if I'm going to start giving you my life's story, I should introduce myself. You can call me Aster. And you are?' The well-dressed minotaur extends a hand.";
		say "     After a moment, you reciprocate, sharing a handshake with him, and give him your name. 'It's nice to meet you.' The two of you spend a brief while idly talking about the area, when he looks down at a watch resting on his arm. 'Unfortunately, I don't think I can stay to chat much longer. But if you'd like to speak more later, get to know each other, I'd be happy to. I always welcome a friendly face, especially since I'm usually much more nervous when talking to people. Come by the [bold type]Museum[roman type] sometime if you'd like, since I'm trying to get a job assisting there.' You shake his hand once more as he gathers a few items from the table, and heads out the door. Maybe you'll see him again.";

It looks distinctly Greek, composed of stone in intricate designs, though the details of the works seem to be faded and worn with age. Everything about the structure paints it as something far older than should be in this park. Despite the strangeness of the world, this still stands out as particularly interesting, and the sight of it reminds you of what Aster asked you to look for.

Soon enough, you find an entrance, and when you enter you can easily see that the interior looks much more well-kept than the outer portions. The first thing to catch your eye when you enter is a tall column, with text inscribed on the front in large lettering. At first, it seems to be in an unknown language, but as you examine it in more detail, it seems to resolve itself into something more familiar. While it seems almost like a riddle, you're reasonably certain that it describes a trial necessary to obtain the 'treasures' within. If you're going to get that amulet, you'll have to play along.";

He stands before you, and gives a small bow. 'Your skills are more enough to prove your bold nature. As proof of your accomplishment, you may claim your prize.' With that, he extends a hand, holding a small amulet, with a symbol of a lion on the front, clearly the prize you have been searching for. You thank him, and take the amulet before leaving the amphitheater. When you look over your shoulder on the way out, however, it seems to have disappeared.";

Perhaps you may someday succeed, but for now, you have failed.' When he finishes speaking, you feel a strange sensation and your vision goes dark for a moment. Before you have time to panic, however, your sight returns, bringing with it vision of the park, with no amphitheater in sight.";

Hopefully your day is going a bit better than mine.' Curious, you ask him about what happened to get him down. 'Well, I tried to get a job here, since history is a big passion of mine, and this place is in better shape than a lot of other areas around here. But I blew it. I didn't even get rejected, I just froze. I'm always like this at the worst times.' He shakes his head before lowering it back into his hands.";

I remember a lot of running, but I still don't know what could have gotten me and caused this.' Aster gestures broadly at himself. 'It's all very ironic, really. I've always been a fan of history, and I especially loved various kinds of mythology. I got it from my parents, who were big fans of Greek myths themselves. That's where my name comes from. My full name is Asterios, after the original Greek minotaur, but I've always thought it was too much of a mouthful. And now here I am, turned into a minotaur myself.

If I could just be more confident, It would be no problem at all.' He looks directly at you, a great deal of his former misery wiped away. 'So that's what I need, then. A way to be more confident. With all the strange things around, I'm sure we could find some sort of... relic or the like, that could give me that confidence.' You see a flash of inspiration in his eyes. 'I think I have a good idea of what to look for, actually. I need to do a bit of research first, though. Why don't you come by again tomorrow, and I'll tell you what I've found?'

An amulet that was said to have been once worn by Odysseus, the famous hero of the Odyssey. Supposedly, it gives the wearer incredible courage. I don't know if it would truly work, but if it does, it could certainly solve my social problems.' He pauses to gather his thoughts, and you nod at him in return. 'There have been some rumors that for some reason it can be found in the park. As unlikely as it might be, I think it's worth checking out. Supposedly, this trinket has an image of a lion.

'Whoops, getting a bit ahead of myself. I can hardly believe that something this historic was actually so close. I'm very impressed you managed to track it down, and even if it turns out to be just a trinket, I'll be grateful.' With that, he looks down at the talisman you collected once again, and you can see him muster what confidence he has. 'Alright, here we go, time to see if it works.'";

He pauses for a moment, thinking. 'Then again, I'm not used to it, so maybe this is what confidence should feel like? Only one way to find out, I suppose. Stay right here, and I'm going to go talk to Valerie again.'

'I got the job this time! I guess this thing really does work, and just in time. I was getting kind of antsy about what else I would do if I couldn't work here.' At that, the newly minted minotaur claps a hand down on your shoulder. 'And I couldn't have done it without you. I think I'm going to start getting to work with my newly acquired job, but feel free to drop by any time, friend!' He then gives you a suggestive look infused with every ounce of his new confidence.

Finally, the entire head is past your lips, and you're able to begin in earnest.

You spend some time swallowing down his load, gasping for air in between spurts, until at last his orgasm abates.

You waste no time in listening to the confident minotaur, and in moments you're lying on your stomach across his desk, with papers and books strewn about you. Being so exposed, out in the open museum atrium, adds a thrill to what's about to happen. He doesn't leave you waiting, and in almost no time at all you feel a very sizable shaft drop down onto your rear, allowing you to feel all the weight of his package resting on you.";

The tip drags its way across your back, tracing a line directly towards your opening. For a scant few seconds, he is motionless, poised to take you without actually doing so. Then the seconds pass, and without warning the broad head of his shaft is resting deep within you as you gasp for breath. From there Aster begins to hammer in and out, plowing you right in the open. The thrusting of his member starts to build a well of pleasure within you, growing significantly alongside the force of his thrusts. Finally it rises to a peak, and with one final slam he hilts his dick in you, flooding you with his bovine essence.";

'Hey, you were a pretty excellent fuck, I've gotta say. I'd love to stick around, but I have some more work to get to. Go ahead and take five to get yourself together, though. If you need to get properly railed again later, you know who to call.' With that, the studious minotaur leaves you, presumably to perform some menial task.

	say "     The minotaur begins to ride you with far more fervor than you expected, and with a skill that can only be born of the amulet you gave him. The up and down motion combined with the way his hole grips your cock bring you incredible pleasure, enough that you can do nothing except wait and allow him to have his way with you. The only thing you can focus on is the feeling on your dick and the sound of his voice. 'Ha, even when I let you use your cock, it's still me in charge, and it always will be. Isn't that right?' You can only nod in response, as your helpless state more than proves him right. 'Well, I only need you to do one more thing. Cum for me, now!' Driven on by his words, you find yourself climaxing, faster than you expected, unloading your cream directly into the bull. As you do so, he comes a stop, allowing it to fill him, before he smiles. 'Well done, just like I asked. Now, I'm going to get up, and then you'll need to get up as well. I still need that chair.' After the experience he just gave you, there's really nothing to do but what he requests.";
