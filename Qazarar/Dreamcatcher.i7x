Curious, you go to follow and see what [SubjectPro of Diego] is planning this time. You keep a safe distance, hoping that this isn't merely an elaborate plan for yet another trick played on you from the coyote. Intentionally or not, [SubjectPro of Diego] seems to be leading you on a merry chase for a time, until finally when you round a tree, [SubjectPro of Diego] seems to have vanished. The only remaining sign that the coyote you were following might have been here is a simple dreamcatcher laying on the ground, maybe dropped by mistake, maybe left for you to find. Carefully, you pick it up, watching for any apparent tricks, but nothing seems obviously suspicious to you, and you simply pocket the dreamcatcher. Perhaps a trick will reveal itself in the future, but at the moment it seems safe enough.";
