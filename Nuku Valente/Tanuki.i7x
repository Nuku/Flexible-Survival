Shinto Shrine is a room. "How odd for an American city. A shinto shrine lays nestled in a small bamboo forest in this part of the park, tucked just off a narrow gravel trail and looking reasonably well kept. It is made of stone and features a number of carved pillars holding up a typically Japanese roof, gently curved and crowned by forked roof finials. In the midst of the structure, a large bronze mirror disc rests on an elaborate half-circular stand. There is a small box for donations, and a miniature iron mallet beside a bell. Perhaps it could be [bold type]rung[roman type]? The air smells of cherry blossoms and spring. You feel safe here.".
