Version 2 of Zephyr Inc by Nuku Valente begins here.
[Version 2.3 - Nanite Monitoring Device task moved here (Main Storyline 2 / Hospital Quest 2)]

"It's about time for Zephyr to show up around here."

Section 1 - Zephyr Office

This is the zephyrad rule:
	say "     Playing around with your radio in an attempt to gain some information about what is going on, you find a channel that seems to have a cycling message. 'Good day to anyone listening. This is Zephyr Incorporated. We wanted to you know that even during this current crisis, our branch office in this fine city remains open. Coordinates follow.' After making a mental note of the description, you listen on to the rest of their recording. 'We here are Zephyr Inc are dedicated to the betterment of mankind through science. And of course we also want to help people outlast what is currently going on. Therefore we are going to award company credit - also known as freecred - to those who contribute to keeping the more aggressive infected in check. A number of ways of observation are in effect in the city, and you will be credited for every hostile you pacify. Swing on by and spend your freecred on useful survival gear. We look forward to meeting you shortly.'";
	say "     The radio continues, 'Please be advised that your Zephyr local branch now stocks our newest technological advancement - the Zephyr Personal Communicator, featuring satellite navigation in a device that fits in your pockets! Never get lost again, with the ZPC. Available now at a limited time offer of only 350 freecred. Visit your Zephyr branch now for more information!'";
[	WaitLineBreak;
	say "There is a brief pause and then a three-tone chime. A new voice comes in. 'As an added announcement, a recent creature migration has taken place. The fact that this coincides with Zephyr's planned lupine relocation program is purely coincidental. We shall provide information on this occurrence, but take no responsibility for those inconvenienced by ferals moving into their new habitats. Details follow. Deet-deet-deet.'";
	say "- Feral and Alpha Wolves successfully relocated to the Urban Forest.";
	say "- Football Wolfman and Wrestling Wolf successfully relocated to the College Campus.";
	say "- Other creatures having migrated to the Urban Forest include the following: Awesome Tree, City Sprite, Cougar, Dryad, Elf, Elk, Elven Hunter, and several varieties of Skunk.";
	say "- As expected with the decrease in local wolves, the Ewe and Ram numbers have risen. Expect increased sightings.";
	say "- Bunny Jock threat level reassessed to level 4.";
	say "- Ebonflame Whelp threat level reassessed to level 2.";
	say "- Panther Taur threat level reassessed to level 4.";

	say "     This is a small Zephyr Inc branch. Their power is hard to argue with, as they actually have power, with bright, fluorescent lights shining down from above. The floor is clean and swept. To the left are some chairs next to a table with old magazines on it. A few people loiter around, eating doughnuts and chatting, all in various stages of mutation. Your eyes are drawn to a [link]price sign[as]look price sign[end link] that hangs above the counter.";

Her eyes then dart quickly between watching you, her terminal and some lights on her desk. She does her best to compose herself and presses a few buttons to stop the lights. You notice that the place's discreet guards are no longer quite so discreet, having moved up beside your large, mephit form even as another pair enter from the back.";
			say "     'Please be calm, [if player is female]ma'am[else]sir[end if],' the woman says in a cheerfully rehearsed tone. 'This is purely routine. Please go with these gentlemen for a complementary examination.' From the way the guards are resting their hands on their holsters, it's clear this complementary examination isn't going to be a voluntary one. Deciding to go along with this, at least for the moment, you allow yourself to be escorted into a small, vaguely medical room. The room is rather cramped given your [if skrp is 1]tauric [end if]Skunkbeast form.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The four guards outside the door talk nervously in hushed tones, stopping only once an examiner arrives. He's clearly a little uneasy and insists on having one of the guards inside the increasingly cramped room with you. You're quickly checked over, photographed and analyzed by some unfamiliar scanners. The doctor, technician or whatever he is never gives his name and steadfastly refuses to explain anything or even talk to you beyond asking you to move from time to time. Finally, a blood sample is taken before you're escorted back into the lobby by the edgy guards.";
			say "     Approaching the front desk, you ask the woman there what that was all about. 'Oh... Ah... I'm sorry about that. It was just a routine examination. Nothi-' She cuts herself off as you give her a stern look, your imposing form looming large over the counter. 'Okay, I'll level with you. When you came in, you'd set off an outstanding notification and triggered an automated alert. It seems HQ'd sent out a team to... investigate a creature similar to your current infection, but they didn't make it back. But don't worry about it. You seem [if humanity of player > 66]pretty[else if humanity of player > 33]fairly[else]somewhat[end if] stable and the data from the examination didn't bring up any major warnings.'";
		else:
			say "     There is a soft chime as you enter the branch office, startling Larissa from her crossword puzzle. Her eyes dart quickly to the terminal and some flashing lights on her desk. She quickly presses a few buttons to stop the lights even as she waves her arm to stop the two guards discreetly approaching you. Another pair enter the lobby from the back and she tells them to stand down and wait. They remain on edge, watching you from the doorway while she talks with someone over her headset. Partway through the call, she puts them on hold to address you.";
			say "     'We're going to need you to go into the back for a routine examination,' she says in a cheerfully rehearsed tone while motioning for you to come up. 'It shouldn't take too long and there's nothing to worry about. I'll fill you in after,' she adds in a hushed tone. Knowing you'll just have to trust her on this, you allow yourself to be escorted by one of the guards into a small, vaguely medical room. The room is rather cramped given your [if skrp is 1]tauric [end if]Skunkbeast form.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The guard, having gotten some reassurance from Larissa, is fairly relaxed if stoically quiet. The examiner, on the other hand, is clearly a little uneasy and insists on having the guard inside the increasingly cramped room with you. You're quickly checked over, photographed and analyzed by some unfamiliar scanners. The doctor, technician or whatever he is never gives his name and steadfastly refuses to explain anything or even talk to you beyond asking you to move from time to time. Finally, a blood sample is taken before you're escorted back into the lobby by the guard.";
			say "     Approaching the front desk, you lean in to chat with Larissa. 'I'm sorry about all that. The system had an outstanding notification about a creature like you, so you'd set off an automated alert. It seems HQ'd sent out a team to [']investigate[']' she says, making the air-quotes, 'the beast, but they didn't make it back. But you shouldn't worry about it... You seem [if humanity of player > 66]pretty[else if humanity of player > 33]fairly[else]somewhat[end if] stable and the data from the examination didn't bring up any major warnings. I can't really tell you much more. Seems it's all classified stuff above my pay bracket. Still, if they let you go after, it'll probably be alright,' she teases cheerfully.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Taking another glance around the room, she motions for you to lean in a little closer. 'How'd you come by an infection so high up on our alert status?' Do you tell her what happened?";
			if player consents:
				say "     You tell her how you'd stumbled across the battle between Zephyr and the previous Skunkbeast Lord. You gloss over some of the details while enhancing the epicness of your struggle with the monstrous mephit. Leaving out the orgiastic nature of your transformation process, you do reassure her that the previous Lord was deposed.";
				say "     So you're in charge of those skunks in the forest now?' she asks with more than casual curiosity in her tone. Remembering who she works for and how they reacted to you even having the infection, you decide it probably wouldn't be healthy to let that be known. 'No, no,' you say with a dismissive wave. 'The skunks leave me alone, but that's about it. There's plenty more of the skunkbeast ones around, so one of them has probably taken over or something.' She seems to buy it and asks you for a few more details before saying she has to get back to work. While you're browsing in the lobby, she seems calm enough as she types away. From the way she glances over on occasion, a paranoid corner of your mind does suspect she's filing some report about what you've just told her.";
				decrease morale of player by 3;
			else:
				say "     Given what you'd just gone through, you decide to play it safe. You tell her you'd picked it up from a mess you'd ended up stepping in (which is true enough, after a fashion). She nods and comments that she hears about that sort of thing happening often. She does end up asking you when and where this happened, what it looked like and so on. She tries to seem casual about her questioning, but you can tell she's fishing for details. You make some generic answers, suspecting they'll all end up in some report. And sure enough, as soon as your chat's done, she's busily typing away at her computer.";
