Story Skipper by Nuku Valente begins here.

Trixie is a person. Trixie is in Grey Abbey Library.

The description of trixie is "Look, it[apostrophe]s Trixie, the story fairy! She's about three inches tall, large for her particular breed. She has bright reddish-purple hair and smooth brown skin. Wielded in her right hand is a relatively large wand of old world oak with a great fancy bauble at the end that looks like a cutely renditioned skunk girl head, grinning at you no matter what angle you view it from. Trixie is well shaped, with, relative to the rest of her mass, B cup breasts and wide hips. Her feet are covered in shimmering gold sandals of sorts. Her chest is covered in a T Shirt that reads 'Let[apostrophe]s skip to the good stuff!'.";

The conversation of trixie is { "Hello. I will teach you a magic word. To use it, just stand in front of me and [bold type]recite[roman type] the word back to me. This will let you bend time and probability, returning you to the condition you were in when you first said the words.... Mostly. I will do my best, but my powers are not infinite. Also, I'm 'Out of Character', so you really don't see me. Confused yet? Good! Here's the magic word:[line break][line break][magic word][line break]" };

To say magic word:
	say "[strength of player]}[dexterity of player]}[stamina of player]}[charisma of player]}[perception of player]}[intelligence of player]}[level of player]}[maxhp of player]}[humanity of player]}[score - 50]}[hp of doctor matt]}[bodyname of player]}[facename of player]}[skinname of player]}[tailname of player]}[cockname of player]}[SatisfiedTanuki]}[hospquest]}[cocks of player]}[breasts of player]}[cunts of player]}[breast size of player]}[cock length of player]}[cock width of player]}[cunt length of player]}[cunt width of player]}[weapon object of player]}[location of Snow]}[location of Sandra]}[if Hyper Squirrel Girl is resolved]1[otherwise]0[end if]}[if Needy Rabbit Girl is resolved]1[otherwise]0[end if]}[location of coleen]}[coleentalk]}[coleenfound]}[coleencollared]}[coleenalpha]}[coleenslut]}[coleenspray]}[hp of doctor mouse]}[coonstatus]}[featunlock]}[butterflymagic]}[catnum]}[mateable]}[gryphoncomforted]}[shiftable]}[medeastuff]}[mtp]}[hyg]}[nes]}[mtrp]}[boristalk]}[borisquest]}[progress of alex]}[angiehappy]}[angietalk]}[deerconsent]}[deerhappy]}[mattcollection]}[orthasstart]}[fancyquest]}[hp of sven]}[lust of sven]}[sarahslut]}[sarahtalk]}[sarahpups]}[progress of alex]}[alexbrunch]}[treasurefound]}[tmapfound]";
	say "[line break]'It seems this magic word gets longer every time I say it. Here is the second half,' she says, taking a breath before speaking on:[line break]";
	say "continuedchant}[orthasstart]}[fancyquest]}[hp of sven]}[lust of sven]}[sarahslut]}[sarahtalk]}[sarahpups]}[progress of alex]}[alexbrunch]}[treasurefound]}[tmapfound]";
	say "[line break]'You'll need to recite that part on its own after telling me the first one.  Don't ask me to explain why.  It's magic!' she says in a teasing tone with a big grin.'";

Reciting is an action applying to [16 things]one topic.
Understand "recite [text]" as reciting.

	if trixie is not visible, say "Your words seem to have no effect." instead;

	repeat with z running from 1 to number of words in x:

		if "continuedchant" matches the text b:
			now upit is 1;
			next;
		change the text of the player's command to b;
		if upit is 1:
			increase z by 58;
