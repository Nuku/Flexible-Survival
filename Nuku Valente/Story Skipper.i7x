Story Skipper by Nuku Valente begins here.

Trixie is a person. Trixie is in Grey Abbey Library.

The description of trixie is "Look, it[apostrophe]s Trixie, the story fairy! She's about three inches tall, large for her particular breed. She has bright reddish-purple hair and smooth brown skin. Wielded in her right hand is a relatively large wand of old world oak with a great fancy bauble at the end that looks like a cutely renditioned skunk girl head, grinning at you no matter what angle you view it from. Trixie is well shaped, with, relative to the rest of her mass, B cup breasts and wide hips. Her feet are covered in shimmering gold sandals of sorts. Her chest is covered in a T Shirt that reads 'Let[apostrophe]s skip to the good stuff!'.";

The conversation of trixie is { "Hello. I will teach you a magic word. To use it, just stand in front of me and [bold type]recite[roman type] the word back to me. This will let you bend time and probability, returning you to the condition you were in when you first said the words.... Mostly. I will do my best, but my powers are not infinite. Also, I'm 'Out of Character', so you really don't see me. Confused yet? Good! Here's the magic word: [magic word]." };

To say magic word:
	say "[strength of player]}[dexterity of player]}[stamina of player]}[charisma of player]}[perception of player]}[intelligence of player]}[level of player]}[maxhp of player]}[humanity of player]}[score - 50]}[hp of doctor matt]}[bodyname of player]}[facename of player]}[skinname of player]}[tailname of player]}[cockname of player]}[satisfied]}[hospquest]}[cocks of player]}[breasts of player]}[cunts of player]}[breast size of player]}[cock length of player]}[cock width of player]}[cunt length of player]}[cunt width of player]}[weapon object of player]}[location of Snow]}[location of Sandra]}[if Hyper Squirrel Girl is resolved]1[otherwise]0[end if]}[if Needy Rabbit Girl is resolved]1[otherwise]0[end if]}[location of coleen]}[coleentalk]}[coleenfound]}[coleencollared]}[coleenalpha]}[coleenslut]}[coleenspray]}[hp of doctor mouse]}[coonstatus]}[featunlock]}[butterflymagic]";
