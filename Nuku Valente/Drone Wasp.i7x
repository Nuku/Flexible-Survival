Section 3 - Endings

when play ends:
	if bodyname of player is "Drone Wasp":
		if humanity of player < 10:
			if bee girl is tamed:
				say "     Hearing a faint buzzing in your mind, you are drawn back to the park, followed at a distance by a worried Honey. There you meet up with several others from the wasp nest and join them. When Honey is spotted in the bushes nearby, the other drones charge in to attack to kill the rival insect, but you stop them. Still sensing a faint connection in your failing mind, you are able to coax the scared bee girl into your arms and, with the help of the others, help her to become a lovely wasp like yourselves. She moans in ecstasy, climaxing repeatedly as a new, permanent stinger grows in to replace her lost one, becomes a strong and beautiful member of the wasp nest and a lifelong companion to you.";
			else:
				say "     Hearing a faint buzzing in your mind, you are drawn back to the park. There you meet up with several others from the wasp nest and join them, lustfully giving yourself over to the pleasure of your insectile bodies. You go along with them, following the buzzing sound you're sensing back to the nest which has been set up in one of the park maintenance buildings. There you enjoy a pleasant life of work and sex with the other beautiful wasps.";
		else:
			say "     Your unusual body is analyzed by the military scientists, but you are given little concern. You do happen to befriend a helicopter pilot, chatting with him while you're in a waiting area, and he's come in with reports after another extraction. He chats with you for a while and even visits you a few times at the compound where you're being held with a large group of others";
			if player is female:
				say ". Claiming that you've been called over for consulting on some of the areas you witnessed in the city, he manages to get some alone time with you in his chopper one evening. There he makes sweet love to you, a wonderfully exciting time with the risk of being caught looming over you to make it all the more invigorating.";
				say "     But at the moment of climax, you instinctively sting him. You apologize profusely, and after his initial anger wears off, he kisses you and promises he'll not tell anyone. He quickly makes up a plan to claim he'd gotten stung on his next mission. Keeping his helmet on over his growing antennae and his fatigues over the chitin covering his legs, he returns you to the compound.";
				say "     When he does not return from his next mission, fallen prey to the drone wasps drawn to his altered body, you are heartbroken. The only solace you can find is that he joined the wasps he found so sexy and is probably very happy with them. To assuage your guilt, you join the military's air force, training to be a helicopter pilot to replace the one you cost them through your foolishness. You are much more cautious in the future, and even after being rendered non-infectious, you make sure to get regular treatments to prevent it from ever happening again. The child he gave you that one night grows up to become a lovely wasp girl who turns the heads of all the boys at the military academy.";
			else:
				say ". You become fast friends and he convinces you to join the military. Becoming a gunner, you join his helicopter crew, helping to defend your friend on his missions into infected zones.";
