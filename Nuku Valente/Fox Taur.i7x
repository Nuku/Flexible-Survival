Starting at your chin, the fur is white and continues down the front of your neck towards your chest."

Warm tingles erupt along your new, lower, belly as a thick udder bubbles into being even as your cock swells right up, pressing along its back and underside as it screams almost as loudly as your sopping wet cunt for action."	"You have a whole second torso extending from where your buttocks would normally be. It looks like that of a fox, complete with red fur on the body, and white fur along the belly. Along your underside, you can feel four rows of teats, jiggling slightly with each of your movements.

	if tf table of rear is not table fox taur:
		say "You feel a bit silly a moment holding the milkers before they seem to leap at you with a mind of their own.

		infect rear with fox taur;
		continue the action;
	say "Slipping the milkers over your new udder causes them to draw your vulpine cream from you. It's very pleasing, causing you to get harder and wetter at once, but does little productive besides that.";


to say foxtaur ending:
	say "Detecting incoming danger, you immediately flee the city on your swift fox paws. Avoiding all contact until you're more than a state away. You stumble across a farm and find it to be inhabited only by an old married couple that look years from death. They are quite surprised to find you one morning, attached to the milking machine and relieving the pressure that was building down there. Feigning harmlessness, they accept you as one of their animals, if the strangest one they ever saw. This works out well enough until the husband falls over while feeding the chickens. You easily leap over the stall wall and scurry over for a look. It appears that age had claimed him and he was dying. Thinking of no better way to assist, you gather him up and let your hungry womb consume him.";
	say "The wife is quite distraught when she can't find her husband and spends days fretting until she comes to you, tearful and sobbing. She tells you about her life with him and how she can't even think about life without him. You can't hold your silence any longer. You reach for her and gently pet her grayed hair and offer her a chance to join him. She is quite startled to have her exotic animal talking back to her instead of placidly listening to her bawling. After some hesitation, she agrees, if it means she can be with her husband. Your womb becomes full shortly after. You remained on the farm ever since, with your two 'younger' children, taking care of the animals and living fondly with one another. Your family does grow over the years, as your rejuvenated children suggest neighbors that could benefit from a life as a fox taur.";
