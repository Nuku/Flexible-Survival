Section 1 - Alex & Alex's Condo

Alex is a person. Alex is in Alex's Condo.
lastAlexfucked is a number that varies.  lastAlexfucked is usually 500.
alexbrunch is a number that varies.
alexdiego is a number that varies.
alexleeinfo is a number that varies.
gettinglee is a number that varies.

The description of Alex is "[if alexbrunch < 4]A mostly humanoid male with ferret-like ears and a long sinuous tail.  He has a twitchy animal nose with whiskers around it.  He has a slightly rumpled suit on, still looking good despite his changes.  He is a pleasantly enough looking person who looks even better in those moments when he's not stress or worried by his clients.[otherwise]Alex is a sexy ferret male, with a cute mustelid head.  His twitchy animal nose has an array of whiskers around it.  He has a slightly rumpled suit on, still looking good despite his changes.  You find his new look quite pleasing to the eyes and he certainly seems much happier and friendlier of late.  It seems the changes he's undergone are for the better.[end if]";

Alex's Condo is a room. It is fasttravel. It is private.
The description of Alex's Condo is "     Near the top of the high rise condo building, Alex's room has an good view of the area, if partially blocked by several of the other surrounding high rises.  His place is fairly well-maintained, the mustelid tidying up occasionally.  It does have the faint, tangy smell of mustelid musk, but it's not too strong.  It is well-furnished, with expensive, trendy-looking furniture and decor.  The big screen television and large stereo are silent, but fill a sizable portion of one wall.  Several pieces of classy art adorn the others, all matching nicely with each other and the room decor as a whole.  There are several legal briefs and law books open on the coffee table in the living room.  Scattered around the floor are several colourful, rubber objects, clearly outlets for any ferretty urges[if alexbrunch > 3].  There has been an increase in the number of rubber toys and shiny things scattered around the condo as the lawyer's gotten more ferrety[end if].  A glance in the kitchen shows that it's not as tidy, and is equally ultra-modern, if now useless.  He's set up a small camper stove on his stove top and is using that for cooking.  Between bouts of manic ferretness, the mustelid lawyer is sitting on his couch, focusing on his papers.";


Section 2 - Conversing with Alex

Instead of conversing the Alex:
	if progress of alex is 0:
		say "     'Have you come back to reconsider my offer?  I could certainly use your help on this.  And remember, I'm willing to get you supplies for your assistance,' the mustelid lawyer says with a smile.  Do you agree to help him? (Y/N)";
		if the player consents:
			say "     'Oh, fantastic!  Trust me on this, I'm definitely going to make it worth your while.  My first client is named Lorenda.  She lives in the Red Light District.'  You are about to ask why she lives there, when he can see the question in your eyes before you even ask it, and sighs.  'Lorenda is a landlady there, who owns the buildings where many of the shops are set up there.  She prefers to live there so she can keep a close eye on her tenants.  Now, would you go get her?'  He seems impatient.  Of course, being a high-level lawyer brings a sizable ego.";
			now progress of alex is 1;
			now find lorenda is unresolved;
		otherwise:
			say "     His smile falters a little, but he tries to remain positive.  'Please continue to consider my proposal.  I think we'll both benefit from it.'";
	otherwise if progress of alex is 3:
		say "     Alex, just coming off a bout of ferretness, puts down the chew toy and looks up at you as you try to tell him you found Darrell.  He looks side to side for the missing sports star, then at you in with a mix of confusion and anger on his face.  'Where's Darrell?  I thought you were saying that you'd found him.'  This is where you have to explain to Alex that Darrell survived the incident, but not in the same way he started it.  Upon hearing that Darrell was still sane and relatively secure mentally, Alex is pleased enough, anyway.  'He can still pay me,' says Alex, 'and that's good enough.  Here's your next installment.'  He hands you another bit of food and water as payment.";

		increase score by 20;
		extend game by 2;
		say "[line break]     'Alright, there's only one client left, and this one's gonna be a doozy, I'll wager.  This last client of mine is an aide to a City Council Member - well, possibly ex-city council at this point.  He doesn't have a whole lot of money, but his case'll be pretty big news if I can get a court to listen to him.  So as far as publicity, this is a huge case for me.  I need you to find him and bring him here.'  He sighs a bit, and his nose wiggles, almost cutely, you think to yourself.  'I'm not sure where he is, honestly.  He was a bit of an outdoorsman, so you might be able to find him at the park or the beach.  Other than that, I can't offer you anything else, besides his name, which is Lee.'";
		now progress of alex is 4;
	otherwise if alextalk is 0 and progress of alex is less than 5:
		say "     Alex's whiskers twitch as he looks at you sternly.  'I need you back out there,' he grumbles before relaxing.  'Sorry, I'm just on edge lately.  My clients may need your help out there, too.  I'm worried about them.'[line break]     He points to his body.  'Besides, look at me.  Once we get out of this mess, out there in the real world, I'll be a joke if I don't have some big clients to get me started again.  I know there'll be a lot of legal ramifications from all this and I want to be poised to represent those who want a normal life despite their changes[if humanity of player is less than 100].  And from the looks of you, you may even end up wanting my services.  If you can come through, I'll even give you a big discount[otherwise].  And if something goes wrong out there before you're rescued, you may even end up wanting my services.  If you can come through, I'll even give you a big discount[end if].";

	otherwise if progress of alex is 1 and a random chance of 3 in 5 succeeds:
		say "     'Please continue looking for Lorenda.  She's in the red light district.  Given what's happening in the city, I think she needs your help first' he says meaningfully.  You nod in understanding, as that part of town would be particularly vulnerable to this outbreak.";
	otherwise if progress of alex is 2 and a random chance of 3 in 5 succeeds:
		say "     'I need you to track down Darrell,' the weaselly lawyer says.  'Being a pro sports star, his case could be worth a lot to me.  He should be at the Smith Haven Mall.'  He points out his window, indicating the large shopping center in the distance and the main route leading to it.";
		Now Smith Haven Mall Lot is known;
	otherwise if progress of alex is 4 and a random chance of 3 in 5 succeeds:

to say alexrandomtalk:
	say "     Alex's whiskers twitch a little as he looks up from his legal briefs to talk with you for a moment.  [one of]'Thanks for agreeing to help me on this.'[or]'Yes? Something I can do for you?'[or]'The city's become really dangerous lately.'[or]'I tried talking to one of those wolverines out there before I met you.  Watch out for them - they've really lost it.'  He rubs his side, which is clearly still sore from the encounter.[or]'From my window, I saw a feline cop.  I thought he might be able to help me, but he assaulted one of the weaker mutants and laughed as fucked her hard.  He was twice my size, so I- I stayed inside until he was gone,' he says softly, ashamed of his weakness.[or]'I have to wonder if this is some sick joke,' he says sadly as he points to himself.  'A lawyer made into a weasel.'[or]'I spotted a peacock out there with my binoculars.  It seems to entrance its victims somehow before leading them off somewhere.'[or]'I was never a very physical guy.  I've gotten through this mess mostly on luck for now, but I'm not strong enough to go out there and explore.  Thankfully, I'm safe enough in here.'[or]'The few other tenants I've seen left in here seem benign and leave me alone.  But please don't go snooping around or bothering them.  I don't want to risk upsetting them.'[or]'I've got to keep focused on my work.  It helps keep these strange instincts at bay.'[or]'There's a beautiful, butterfly creature fluttering around out there at times.  It's very pretty, in an odd sort of way.'[or]'One of my neighbours had a pet ferret.  I wonder if I caught this because of it.'[or]'I'd really like a moment to relax and unwind, if you know what I mean.'[or]'I've always been a sensitive guy, I think.  All this fighting, insanity and death is really upsetting.'[or]'Ahhh!  All this waiting is so frustrating,' he growls before getting up and running around and over his couch like a manic ferret for a bit.  Eventually, he settles down and collapses on the couch, panting and feeling much better after releasing all that pent up energy.[or]'Do you like my place?  I decorated it myself.  I'll miss it when we go,' he sighs softly.[or]'I've kept an eye out from my window using these,' he says, holding up a pair of binoculars.[or]'I don't like leaving here too often, as there are so many stairs to climb whenever I get back.'[or]'Being pent up in here makes the ferret in me go stir crazy at times.'  He grabs a nearby rubber ball and chews at it for a few times, chirring softly as he does.  'If I don't give it some release, things can get... messy.'[in random order]";

His ears have mutated to become somewhat pointed, and now rest near the top of his head. He has a small button nose, with prodigious whiskers on either side, and a furry tail swivels from behind him.

[if humanity of player is less than 100]despite your changes...[end if] I figure you might be able to help me. If you're out exploring the city, it means you can handle the monsters out there.' His nose twitches, as do his whiskers, as he seems to be pondering something. 'Before the incident, I was a high-priced lawyer, and once rescue comes, I plan on returning to that job. But I have three wealthy clients that won't be able to pay me if they get turned into creatures without a thought in their heads but sex.'";

'Here's my proposition,' he says. 'I have access to a pretty solid stockpile of food and water. For each of my clients you manage to bring back to me, to my condo in the high-rise over there,' he points, 'I'll give you one of each. How's that sound?'";

Ostensibly, Alex hires them on as housekeepers, but pays them incredibly well to basically be permanent houseguests.

As a candidate[']s views, politics and platform could radically change away from the electorate that selected them, this is a reasonable concern, but it also keeps good, sane officials from being removed for inconsequential changes.
