Science by Nuku Valente begins here.

When play begins:
	repeat with x running through research:
		now x is a part of the nerd	;

Book - Science Advisor

Nerd is a person. "A science advisor awaits your attention. They have a name, but most just call them the [bold type]nerd[roman type]. Perhaps you want to discuss [bold type]research[roman type].".
Nerd is in Village center.
Description of nerd is "[science advisor of tribe of Player]".

After examining the nerd:
	if progress of current of nerd < cost of current of nerd:
		say "Current Research Topic: [current of nerd]([progress of current of nerd]/[cost of current of nerd])";
	say "[line break]To begin a new topic, type [bold type]research (topic)[roman type].";
	say "Type [bold type]research[roman type] alone to see available topics.";

Nerding is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "nerd" as nerding.

check nerding:
	say "The nerd is a person, not an action. You could try looking at them?(look nerd)" instead;

Part - Change Topics

Researchlist is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "Research" as researchlist.

Check researchlist:
	if nerd is not visible, say "You need your trusty ner, er, science advisor, to conduct matters of research." instead;

carry out researchlist:
	say "Available Topics: [no line break]";
	repeat with x running through valid research:
		if x is complete and x is definite, next;
		LineBreak;
		say "[x]([progress of x]/[cost of x])[if x is indefinite](Level: [level of x])[end if][if current of nerd is x](Current Topic)[end if][no line break]";
	say "To begin a new topic, type [bold type]research (topic)[roman type].";

Researching is an action applying to one thing.
Understand "Research [research]" as researching.

Check researching:
	if nerd is not visible, say "You need your trusty ner, er, science advisor, to conduct matters of research." instead;
	if noun is complete and noun is definite, say "You seem to have already completed that topic." instead;
	if noun is current of nerd, say "Your advisor assures you that it is already being worked on as hard as it can be. Maybe if we had more scientists?" instead;

Carry out researching:
	say "[description of noun]";
	say "[line break]Begin?";
	if Player consents:
		now current of nerd is noun;
		say "You begin researching [noun].";
	else:
		say "Aborted.";


Book - Define Research

A Research is a kind of thing.
A Research has a text called Description.
A Research has a rule called validation.
The validation of a Research is usually Warvailable rule.
A Research has a number called progress.
A Research has a number called cost.
A Research has a rule called Completion.
The completion of a research is usually nothing rule;
A research has a text called perk.
A research can be indefinite or definite.
A research is usually definite.
A research has a number called level.

This is the nothing rule:
	do nothing;

Definition: A Research (called J) is valid:
	follow the validation of J;
	if rule succeeded:
		yes;
	else:
		no;

Definition: A Research (called J) is complete:
	if level of J > 0, yes;
	if progress of J >= cost of J:
		yes;
	else:
		if the printed name of J is listed in perks of tribe of Player:
			yes;
		else:
			no;


Part 2 - Research Topics

The nerd has a research called current.
cur is a text that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved]

Local Survey is a Research.
Description of it is "Surveying our immediate surroundings will better prepare us for the unexpected (Perception +5%)".
The cost of it is 30.
The completion of it is Local Survey Rule.

This is the local survey rule:
	now perception of tribe of Player is ( perception of tribe of Player * 105 ) / 100;
	say "The perception of your tribe is now [perception of tribe of Player]";

An everyturn rule (this is the SCIENCE rule):
	if science of tribe of Player < 1, continue the action; [ No research without research points ]
	if current of nerd is complete and current of nerd is not indefinite:
		say "Your current research topic is complete. You should pick a new one.";
		continue the action;
	let foragers be workers of researcher;
	increase foragers by 1; [The nerd is always there. They love you!]
	[First check for easy to grab salvage, will become more scarce over time]
	let x be a random number from 80 to 120; [mild variance]
	increase x by (Intelligence of tribe of Player) / 5;
	if "Brilliant" is listed in perks of tribe of Player:
		increase x by 20;
	now x is x * foragers * 2;
	now x is x / 100;
	let z be x;
	if z > science of tribe of Player:
		now z is the science of tribe of Player;
	if x > 0: [ There is science to be done ]
		if z > 0:
			say "Your science advances: +[z]";
			increase progress of current of nerd by z;
			if progress of current of nerd > cost of current of nerd:
				say ". [bold type][current of nerd][roman type] is complete!";
				follow the completion of current of nerd;
				if the perk of current of nerd is not "":
					add the perk of current of nerd to perks of tribe of Player;
			decrease science of tribe of Player by z;
			if current of nerd is indefinite and progress of current of nerd > cost of current of nerd:
				say " Research continues on [current of nerd].";
				now progress of current of nerd is 0;
				now cost of current of nerd is cost of current of nerd * 2;
				increase level of current of nerd by 1;
		now x is x / 2;
		if x < 1, now x is 1;
		increase science of tribe of Player by x;



Farming is a research.
