Moving over your legs, she starts licking and kissing at your shaft, then presses her bosom around your [cock size desc of player] [cock of player] penis. The soft flesh of her breasts slide against your shaft as she gives you a tittyfuck. Her tongue and lips move in from time to time to work at your glans. The whole time you are lost in a wave of adoration for this beautiful creature, eventually crying out in joy as you cum messily across her tits and face. She grins at you and licks her lips while spreading your seed across your bosom in a wanton display that would make you rock hard again had you not cum so hard for this most lovely of beings.

The whole time you are lost in a wave of adoration for this beautiful creature, eventually crying out in joy as you cum messily and her hot juices soak your face. She grins at you and licks her lips as she spreads the juices that are running down her chin over her hard nipples in slow circles. Your pussy quivers, almost cumming again from this wanton display from this most lovely of beings. She grabs you again with her foot talons and carries you back to the ground.";

She moans and chirps in increasing pleasure as your eager tongue pleasures her, eventually driving her to a powerful climax that leaves her hot juices running down your face and her feathered legs. She grins at you and rubs her talon-hands over her wet cunt, then rubs her own juices over her nipples and then at your bare groin. 'Mmm... maybe there's hope for you yet. Let's see if this will help you along,' she says softly before grabbing you in her foot talons and carrying to back to the ground and flying off.";

Between the wet motion of her hot lips across your shaft and the show she puts on groping her breasts, you are fully hard almost immediately. Once satisfied you're ready to go, she lifts her feathered rear and lowers herself down onto your shaft with an avian squawk. Her hot, wet pussy grips and squeezes at your throbbing penis. 'Mmm... yes, my lover... do it... fill me with your eggs...' she cries out as she cums hard and her inner walls grip down tightly on your cock, driving you to cum as well. Your hot seed rushes into her, filling her needy womb with your semen, breeding the lustful harpy.";

Wouldn't that be wonderful,' she says in a crooning voice. You moan and chirp in response, your besotted mind willing to agree to nearly anything for your feathered lover. You switch to her other breast for more of her delicious milk. You nurse from her until she has no more milk to give and you've had several powerful orgasms from her continuous attention to your quivering cunt.
