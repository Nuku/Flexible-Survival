The soft flesh of her breasts slide against your shaft as she gives you a tittyfuck. Her tongue and lips move in from time to time to work at your glans. The whole time you are lost in a wave of adoration for this beautiful creature, eventually crying out in joy as you cum messily across her tits and face.

She moans and chirps in increasing pleasure as your eager tongue pleasures her, eventually driving her to a powerful climax that leaves her hot juices running down your face and her feathered legs. She grins at you and rubs her talon-hands over her wet cunt, then rubs her own juices over her nipples and then at your bare groin. 'Mmm... maybe there's hope for you yet.

Once satisfied you're ready to go, she lifts her feathered rear and lowers herself down onto your shaft with an avian squawk. Her hot, wet pussy grips and squeezes at your throbbing penis. 'Mmm... yes, my lover... do it... fill me with your eggs...' she cries out as she cums hard and her inner walls grip down tightly on your cock, driving you to cum as well. Your hot seed rushes into her, filling her needy womb with your semen, breeding the lustful harpy.";

Wouldn't that be wonderful,' she says in a crooning voice. You moan and chirp in response, your besotted mind willing to agree to nearly anything for your feathered lover. You switch to her other breast for more of her delicious milk. You nurse from her until she has no more milk to give and you've had several powerful orgasms from her continuous attention to your quivering cunt.

This is the Harpy Infection rule:
	if Player has a body of "Harpy":
		trigger ending "Harpy Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			if centrallib is 7:
				say "     As a harpy in the library, you quietly tend to the stacks as do the others. The guard outside makes sure that you are rarely disturbed, leaving you and your sisters to quietly read most of the time. On occasion, you fly out into the city to pluck up a [if Player is female]male to satisfy your needs and give you an egg for the season. Sometimes, if he's cute enough, smart enough and quiet enough, you [']allow['] him to stay, making him into the newest harpy of the aerie[else]female or herm to satisfy your lusts, screwing her until you're sure she'll grow round with a harpy egg. Sometimes, if she's cute enough, smart enough and quiet enough, you [']allow['] her to stay, making her into the newest harpy of the aerie[end if][if Player is male]. The other harpies also enjoy your cock often, many of them getting eggs from you[end if][if Player is puremale]. You have become an unusual creature of myth and legend, the rare male librarian[end if].";
			if hellHoundLevel > 0:			[Hellhound while taken by the librarians]
				say "[line break]     Lost to your new fate as a harpy at the library, you forget about your deal with the hellhound, troubled only be the occasional, unremembered dream or an uncomfortable feeling when reading stories about deals with the devil. But he does not forget; your foul contract was only delayed to better prepare you for your coming, unending fate.";
				say "     When that times comes, you are pulled into the pits of Hades and given a life of eternal servitude as a sexual slave to the countless foul hellhounds who guard the gates of Hell. You're chained down, never to fly freely again and made to mate with the hellish dogs. The fel beasts breed you incessantly[if Player is female], filling your womb with corrupted eggs[else], forcing you to mount bitches while the males climb atop you[end if]. The blood-red eggs hatch to release more hellhounds, but these have large, raven wings on their backs, allowing the hounds to fly. The flying hounds add to the dark forces of the underworld. They nurse from your [if Player is female]tits[else]cock[end if]and grow strong, eventually joining the others in mating you until the ends of time.";
			else:
				say "     You take flight and are rejoined with other harpies high in a secluded mountain. You are content with one another except when heat strikes. Once a year, each of you feels a 'special' need that cannot be met by your sisters and you descend on the small city below, plucking up a male to satisfy you and give you an egg to care for, until the next year. Most men prove to be pliable enough, and a few even stay, helping to tend to the aeries while the females do business and hunt.";
		else:
			if Harpyconsent > 0:
				say "     You are rescued and taken back to civilization. Though you greatly enjoy having access to flowing water and easy food, you never forget the tingle of her lips on your own. Eventually, driven by longing, you take flight back to that great city, and eventually find her. Convincing her to leave with you would be a whole other adventure...";
			else:
				say "     Adjusting to life as a harpy takes some getting use to. You find that a good perch works better than a couch, and your diet has a lot more nuts and berries than your old diet ever had. Still, you're mostly human, and getting by proves easy enough for such a young, pretty, looking thing.";


[ Edit this to have the correct name as well]
Harpy ends here.
