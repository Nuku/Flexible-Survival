When you feel sure that you can't see or hear anyone inside, you decide to pass through the remains of the door and search through the broken home. You find some old framed pictures on the wall of what you assume were the previous owners of the house, but other than that and some antique furniture, it seems that most of the house has been emptied of anything worth taking. When you realize that you won't find anything else worthwhile inside, you decide to look around outside and notice what seems to be a stable. Going over, you explore the stable in the hopes that you'll be luckier in your search, but only find the strong smell of horses permeating the structure.";
		say "     You take care where you step, avoiding the mess of dirt and hay, as well as the white puddles of equine cum which show that the people and creatures here likely became infected. Hoof-prints in the dirt around the stable head off out into the plains where the transformed horses probably live now in some altered form. As you approach one of the doors inside the stable, you hear noises coming from the other side, as well as noticing some fresh prints on the ground telling you that some of the horses may still be lurking around."; [Paragraph Length 800 - 1000] [steff:describe the outside of the ranch house when you first find it, what it looks like, the condition, if it looks abandoned or maintained etc.]

You take care where you step, not wanting to stand in any of the many pools of equine cum. When you approach the door of the stable, you hear the same noises coming out of inside the stable as last time as well as noticing some fresh prints on the ground, telling you that in fact the creature may still be lurking around.";

All but one, who is left behind due to it being tied down in one of the stalls. Upon taking a closer look, you see a small centaur mare that was forced to be on a milking machine repurposed as a sex toy. Upon taking a closer look, you see a small centaur mare lying on her belly that, judging from the rope bindings and ball-gag, it is safe to assume that she most likely has been hooked up to the milking machine not by her own decision.

In a corner you see a three-way of males, the first one lying on his belly while the second is on top of him on his knees, and lastly the third one is fully standing letting the whole speed go by the movements of the middle one. Beside some hay bales, two mares are in each other's embrace, lips locked and fingers caressing their partner's breasts.

With a wink, he then turns back to his compatriots in the building, to chill out and maybe clean up a bit after themselves.
