Old Plaza is a situation.
ResolveFunction of Old Plaza is "[ResolveEvent Old Plaza]".
Sarea of Old Plaza is "Red".

to say ResolveEvent Old Plaza:
	say "     While walking down the seedy streets of the town, you enter a old run down plaza. There is a large oak tree that dominates the center of the plaza. The tree is adorned with ornaments and other trinkets that have been worn down by time. A strong breeze blows through the plaza, rattling the ornaments which culminates in a soft windchime like noise. You examine the buildings in the plaza, all of which are significantly older any of the buildings you've seen. Floorboards creek as you enter the buildings, which smell of old wood. As you explore one of the larger buildings, you come across a large quilt that should be placed centrally in the room, but it is instead bunched up on one side of the room. Curious, you enter the room to find a trap door in the floor. The door opens easily as you pull up on the latch, revealing a descending spiraling staircase made of stone. Do you descend down the staircase?";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yeah, it seems interesting.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - You'd rather not, who knows what you will encounter down there.";
	if player consents:
		say "     Steeling yourself, you grab a torch and head down into the abyss. Minutes pass as you walk down these stairs, the air temperature drops precipitously to the point that you can start seeing your own breath. [if player is naked]You shiver, wrapping your arms together and lamenting that you decided to wander around the seedy streets of the red light district in the nude.[else]You pull your clothing up tightly, keeping in what warmth you can.[end if] Finally, after what seems like forever you reach the bottom of this stair case. You shudder at the thought walking all the way back up those stairs. Poking your head out from the stairwell, you see a large hallway carved out of the bedrock itself. However, your vision is cut short by a thick fog which obscures anything more than 20 or 30 feet away. This place is giving you the creeps, but you didn't come down here for nothing. Gathering what resolve you have, you enter the ancient catacombs.";
		move player to Ancient Catacomb Entrance;
		AddNavPoint Ancient Catacomb Entrance;
		now Old Plaza is resolved;
	else:
		say "     This place is too spooky for you, maybe you'll come back later. You begin the treacherous journey back up to the surface.";

Section 2 - Visions of the past

instead of navigating Ritualist Supply Room while (FirstTimeRitualistSupplyRoom is true):
	say "     After opening the creaky old wooden door, you find yourself in a large supply room filled with all sorts of odds and ends. The fog permeates into this room as well, limiting your vision. Still you can see bins upon bins of dried out plants to your left. Barrels line the wall to your right, each with a tap on it for easy extraction of the liquids inside. A large table sits in the center of the room, made of some ornate stone that you have not seen before. There are some goods from around the room sprawled out on it, it looks like a place where someone would prepare some materials, but for what you are not sure. Just at the end of your vision, you see a large shelf filled with candles against the far wall. You walk over to the table, running hand softly over the cold stone countertop. Without realizing it, you start to feel very sleepy and stumble onto the tabletop as you drift into a light slumber.";
	say "     Opening your eyes, you find yourself in another body, that of a young fit man with tan skin and a light dusting of body hair on your chest. Your arms are currently pulled behind your back by a large muscular man, who you can't see but find yourself trusting implicitly. Turning your attention to what's in front of you, you find a younger man bent over with his stomach on the table. He's fairly thin and quite pale, but his bum looks good enough to plow. You are manhandled into position by the stronger male, lining your sizable cock up with the tight puckered hole before you. Two large calloused hands run over your body appreciatively until they grab the necklace you're wearing and over you the lace to bite down on. With a cocky grin, you take the necklace into your mouth as if you were accepting a challenge. A small metal cross gently hands by your chin, suspended by the lacing of your necklace.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You close your eyes and wait with anticipation of what's about to come. The man behind you is extremely quite, waiting for just the right moment to act. Letting your guard down for just a moment is all it takes for the man to strike. His huge footlong cock is abruptly shoved into your ass down to the hilt with so much force that your own cock is hilted in the submissive man laid out before you. The force of the blow is only amplified by his two large and abnormally heavy balls smacking into your toned cheeks a moment later. This nearly knocks you off your footing, but you manage to catch yourself and push backwards into the firm hips of the dominant man behind you. With your jaw still clenching down on the necklace, you give the man a triumphant grin over your shoulder. The man draws his cock out of your ass slowly and then slams all the way home again, setting a slow but brutal pace. All he manages to get out of you is a few grunts, but the slut beneath you screams and moans incoherently.";
	say "     'I see the slut has already failed to keep his composure, but you're doing well young man. Let us see how you fair with a faster pace,' The dominant male whispers into your ear. The thrusts into your ass become faster and faster until he has you bouncing back and forth between him and the whore. He pulls your arms back so hard that they are beginning to get sore, but you use the leverage to drive your ass back onto the cock with enough force to cause the man to let out a groan. You would have smiled at that success, but your currently far to busy concentrating on maintaining this brutal pace all the while keeping this necklace in your mouth. Under no circumstance will you let out a moan now, not when you are so close.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     It's a very difficult tempo to maintain, especially with your mouth closed around this necklace limiting your air intake. Your body is covered in sweat, muscles are growing sore, and balls are getting empty having already spent two loads in the whore beneath you. After what feels like a eternity, you finally feel the man's cock swell inside of you. Your eyes go wide as his cock stretches you further than ever before, grimacing through it, you bite down on your necklace so hard that you bite clean through the lace. With a shock, you lean forward and manage to catch one end of the string in your mouth, causing the cross to slide down the string and clatter onto the ground. Fear envelops, you knowing that you might just have failed, though not in the way you expected. As rope after rope fills your toned buttocks, you sit there hoping that you've done enough to pass.";
	say "     You feel quite a bit bloated as the man finally finishes dumping his load into you. Despite your apprehensions you feel rather calm now, feeling more and more relaxed with every throb of his cock and jet of his spooge. Crushing your fears altogether, the man whispers into your ear, 'Excellent work boy, you've earned your apprenticeship.' He pulls you into a rough kiss, causing you to discard the useless string as you moan into his mouth. You kiss for several moments before he starts to withdraw his enormous cock, you're reluctant to let it go and groan as it scrapes by your prostate, exiting your ass with a satisfying wet pop. He slowly lets go of you and you spin around to get a good look at your new master. He's quite tall, maybe six foot six with short blond hair, a neatly trimmed beard, and a strange black tattoo on his face. His muscles are large and chiseled, cutting deep grooves into the skin to clearly define them. Between his legs lays massive cock that's wrist thick and just over a foot long, currently dripping with a large amount of cum.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     His massive frame intimidates you, you always thought yourself a strong man and most people would agree with you. However, you six foot tall, muscular, yet lithe frame just doesn't compare to the man before you. Your awe inspired gaze shifts up to his handsome face once again, and you stare into his ocean blue smoldering eyes that glow with magical power as you relish in the feeling that this powerful man wants you. Sinking to your knees begin to polish his mighty 'sword,' the strong taste of his seed soothing you, bringing your signature cocky grin back to the surface. [if WSlevel is 3]Without warning, a strong stream of piss hits you in the face. You sit still in shock briefly before coming back to your senses, dutifully opening your mouth and allowing him to spray you down. A minute passes as he uses you as his personal toilet, leaving your stomach full and covered in his stentch. [end if]The man spins around giving you an eyeful of his shapely ass as he grabs his cloak and tome off one of the nearby shelves. 'Come boy, let's go get you equipment fitting for your new station.' Excitedly, you chase after him eventually walking by his side down the corridor with his spooge dripping down your thighs [if WSlevel is 3]and body glistening with his piss[end if]. Neither of you pay any heed to the unmoving whore on the table, who appears to have passed out from the brutal fuck long ago.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You wake up with a gasp, heart racing as you experienced the rough fucking in what appears to be only a few seconds. Walking become a bit more difficult, your bum feels quite sore but you find it oddly satisfying. [if WSlevel is 3]Interestingly, the cold doesn't bother that much right now as a pleasant warmth emanates from your stomach as if you drank something warm and refreshing.[end if] During your vision, you recall a cross dropping down to the floor near the table. Looking down, you find the cross sitting there covered in dust. You pick up the cross, and find that is it emblazoned with a strange black symbol that you are not familiar with. Tucking this into your bag, you feel that it might be useful in the future. You turn your attention to the rest of the stuff in this room and are drawn to the candles in the back of the room. Smelling the candles to find the ones that you fancy, you take a few and put them into your bag. Having collected everything useful, you stop and think of what to do next. You recall the two men left the room and headed to the west, maybe you could explore a bit and find out some more.";

Section 3 - Discovering the Archives

instead of navigating Ancient Archives while (FirstTimeAncientArchives is true):
	say "     You walk through empty stone hallway for about a minute before it seems to open up into a large library. The fog is heavy here, making it hard to see clearly. The room appears to be set up as a large circle, with several rows of circular bookshelves placed around a central point. In the very center of the array of bookshelves is a pedestal with a massive tome placed on it. The circular bookshelves have a few clearings, allowing passage in cardinal directions. To the east is where you came from, the other directions must lead futher into the library. The bookshelves continue upwards past your vision, even though you can't see it you are sure it extends quite a ways. Confirming your suspicions, you see stairs to the west that lead upwards. A silent dread fills you as you stand in this room, for some reason you believe its very important to make as little noise as possible.";
	say "     You walk up to the pedestal, examining the massive tome that sits upon it. Flipping to the cover, you see the phrase 'Archives of The Brotherhood of Templars' printed on the front along with a large black symbol. Pulling out the cross you found in the supply room, you compare the symbols and find that they are indeed identical. So this book has something to do with that cultist and his apprentice. Perplexed, you open the tome to a random page and fortunately find a entry that lists a book 'A brief history of the Templars'. Looking at the numbering listed by the title, you give a brief inspection of a nearby bookshelf until you find the small tome. You see some small benches dotted throughout the library and settle down onto one as you crack open the book.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The books depict a 'Brotherhood of Templars' that started out as a small sect of knights and their squires. These brave warriors dedicated their lives to fighting monsters and other creatures of myth and fairy tail, a dangerous but rewarding line of work. You read several short stoires, tales of heroism by several different knights and depiction of the monsters they had slain. The stories then turn to the personal lives of these knights, they dedicated their lives to making others happy but sacrificed their own happiness in the process. An angel sought to free these men from their torment by having them turn to eachother for fulfillment. In a act of great sacrifice, the angel instilled these warriors with an undeniable lust for the male body. Instilling mortals with unrestrained lust was against the angelic code, and so the angel was banished from the heavens. They fell with a smile on their face, as they saw the joy they saw the joy that filled the hearts of the warriors as they induldged in eachothers' bodies.";
	say "     The Brotherhood of Templars officially came into existence shortly after this blessing, and they worshipped this angel as their new god. It was then that the Templars went from simple warriors to mage knights, their god gifting them with magical talent for their good deeds. This blasphemy along side their depraved sex acts caused conflict between them and society at large. The order became more secretive over time, doing its best to avoid conflict while continuing to go around and slay monsters. The common folk eventually tolerated their pressence, enjoying the peace and saftey that came with their services. However, angels, demons, and their respective followers did not get along with the Templars. The angels saw them as heretics who worshiped a false god and induldged in their sinful nature. The demons saw them as holy warriors and far to lawful for their liking. It is said that these Templars continue to face all sorts of foes on many different worlds.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The last chapter indicates that the order has set up small outposts on many different worlds. After reading a very long list, you come across a single entry that lists 'Earth'. Your bodies starts to tingle as it dawns on you that this story isn't fiction, but a history of events! Heart racing, you skip ahead to the entry on Earth itself and read the details. 'Once this world is threatened, a holy sword in the stone will find its proper owner. If the owner has not yet heeded the call, place candles around the sword and douse it in a man's cum.' The book shows a small picture of a resplendent sword burried in stone, with some trees dotted throughout the background. Maybe this sword is somewhere in the forest? [if demonologist is tamed]Recalling Xaedihr mentioning a demonic invasion, you think it might be wise to seek out this sword.[else]Okay so things are different now, people are more slutty to be sure, but that's not a threat to the world right? A real threat would be a demonic invasion that intends to enslave all of humanity, and you doubt something like that would ever happen. But if you do come across a hunky half demon who has been to hell and warns of impending doom, you'll know what to do.[end if] You put the book back where you got it and decide what to do next.";
