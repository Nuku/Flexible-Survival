At the head of the pack is a large wolf with large, poorly shaved patches his pelt, showing the pink skin beneath. The bag, sent flying by the collision, flips in the air and opens, spilling out what must be the shaved wolf's fur. Deciding that the soldiers must ultimately be responsible for his shaving, he and the other wolves attack.";

You watch as soldiers are forced to suck wolfcock or are buggered by the angry pack. The humans begin to transform, gaining fur, ears or tails as the lupine infection starts to spread. As some start to gain pussies, these new holes are stuffed full of wolfcock to breed pups in them. When the soldiers succumb enough to stop resisting, they are dragged off by the wolves, probably to their den to finish mating with them until they're fully members of the pack. The remaining wolves start sniffing around the area, spreading out. Worried they'll pick up the trail of your scent you think it best to make your escape.

Whether the accident set him off, his CO, or something else, you can't be sure. Your best guess is that they may have been under a lot of strain and everything is slowly wearing them down. After you begin to relax and move closer, you hear a snickering, the exact same snickering from before: directly above your head.

You're currently behind the soldiers, and close to a burned-out car. It is but one of multiple strewn-about wrecks blocking the road. You'd no doubt make a lot of noise if you tried to get around or over all of it, so you simply huddle behind the car. With a good hiding place, and sightlines, you examine the scene more fully. There's a fire truck blocking the road beyond where you're at, probably a good thirty feet from the current blockage.

Even without his voice, his posture and arms waving about give a good impression of his mood. Obviously tensions are running high, and the eight soldiers in the back are themselves looking quite beleaguered. Many pace about or simply lean against walls or in corners.

Their obvious anger forces you to back up, as the men seem eager to direct all of their substantial ire your way, at least before a yell breaks the tension: or redirects it. There were eight soldiers glaring you down seconds ago, but now there are only seven. The two who were yelling by the firetruck rush back to rejoin their squad. They all huddle up back-to-back as the CO looks your way. 'What is going on?' he questions. You only get a momentary second to shrug before he's yanked down into the ground, vanishing completely. Strangely, there aren't any holes or debris anywhere around where he was moments ago. Something's very twisted here.";

The ones farthest from you make a break for the firetruck, moving to clamber over it. As soon as one is almost up the side, a thin, bony hand shoots from the asphalt below and grabs his ankle. The others nearby try to kick at the arm, but there own assailants soon reveal themselves. More bony hands and insectoid-like appendages grip their ankles and wrists.

They break his fall, but they also keep him above ground, not quite yanking him below yet. Various new arms and growths surface from the asphalt like it was merely a placid sea. These new ones seem to be covered in tiny little hairs and no visible hands, but soon they're slicing and flicking through the air all around the soldier, leaving him to struggle as an odd dance is carried out before you. Within seconds every scrap of clothing sheds from the man's form, leaving him in only his bare skin as those new appendages sink back into the earth. The original arms and hands still keep a grip on him though, and hold him a few feet off the ground.";

However, they appear different than even what's often seen around the city. The lengths look almost bony at first, but soon the top halves split like petals in the morning, revealing dozens of red beads clumped together in what can only be described as a mass of throbbing spheres. It all comes together to form a rather thick and bumpy looking structure, and you can only imagine what it'd feel like inside your [if player is male]ass[else if player is female]pussy[else]mouth[end if]. Each bead seems to be about the size of a large marble, and the width of the phallic things is at least three of the beads across. It's hard to tell the true length though, as there could always be more to be revealed under the rest of the boney structure. All you know is that the current revealed length could no doubt reach deep, deep inside one's body.";

The man quickly breaks after that, releasing screeching moans as he begins to gyrate his hips, helping to sink the weird phallus deeper into his ass. His tongue also reaches out to the length over his mouth, lapping at it like a man dying of thirst. All of the limbs shutter at once, like they're all one being. It takes no time at all for both phallic shapes to begin taking action, one sinking into the man's mouth and throat, as the other begins to push in and out of the soldier's ass. Another shudder goes through the limbs as you watch the two dick-like things pulse and throb. A thick, white substance bursts from the man's mouth as his head lulls, the same liquid dripping from between his legs as his stomach swells. This keeps going and going, and neither cock stops pushing in and out of the male's form. The hands grip tighter around his arms and legs as he convulses and shakes.";

It's hard to tell entirely from where you are, but you're certain he's cumming what's left of his brains out. The limbs then begin to shrink, no, sink into the ground, dragging the soldier with them. Soon you only see the soldier's sweaty, cum slick chest, but moments later even that disappears beneath the asphalt. 'Well, that was fun,' came a voice above you.

They split up and jump towards the walls, looking as if they were expecting to find something leaning against them. Each man glances around before bony hands and appendages burst from the walls like breaching whales. But these insect-like things don't immediately drag them from view. They hold them in place, the bony hands gripping tight to their squirming forms. Soon, insect-like lengths that are covered in tiny hairs slip from the walls, surrounding them, slashing and dancing through the air around the pinned soldiers.

Other arms soon appear and split open to reveal red throbbing beads inside, they look and throb like dicks, but are made up of clusters of red beads compacted into a solid shape. They almost look like anal beads glued together into a thick, long construct. The beads are each the size of large marbles, and each of the lengths are three of these beads across, at least. They hover in-front of each man's face, and even as the males seems to try to lean away, their holes twitch ever more.

Unable to decide, but growing lost to lust, you simply step forward and grind against the ass closest to you, hotdogging between his muscular cheeks. With things growing more and more slick down their, and the twitching hole making his need obvious, you find your tip pops in without any attempt by you. With this, you wrap your arms around your temporary mate, shoving balls-deep into him as he gasps out. His gasp lets the throbbing, red length before him pop into his mouth. This seems to make your fucking all the better as the flesh around your cock grips even tighter, drawing your needs to new heights as you begin to pull out to the tip.";

Your efforts are short-lived however, as you feel your balls pull up and cock throb. You slam balls deep once more, holding your hips tight against the soldier's ass as you unload shot after shot of seed. Your cum fills him up enough to where it even begins to dribble out around your shaft. However, this isn't enough for you, and as he is yanked into the wall and off your cock, your eyes turn to his friend. His mouth is already filled with the phallic length before him, making his ass even easier to slip into. That, and all of the cum already caking your cock works as great lube.";

Your cock throbs and your hips slap into his ass a few more times before slapping and holding against his cheeks, unloading what feels like pints of cum. Once more the seed spills out of the hole and around your cock, making it easier for the body to be ripped away from you and into the wall. Hunching over, you realize how exhausted you are. Turning and glancing at where the other two were, you realize they're all gone now. Not even the weird disembodied limbs remain in your sight. Sliding down the wall you were just fucking the soldier's against, you rest for a few moments. Cries in the distance remind you that you have to keep moving though, drawing you to stand and return to your exploration.";

'Oh well,' a voice says from above. You glance up and see nothing, but are all too aware as to who, or what, it probably was. Straightening yourself up and making sure you're safe to move, you turn away from the pinned in alcove. You then head out and resume your exploration.";
