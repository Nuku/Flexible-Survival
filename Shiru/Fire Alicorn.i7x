He's tall, around 7ft or so, and his body is covered in short, pale red fur that does little to hide the definition of a muscular six-pack adorning his chest. His legs end in thick, black hooves, and a long, fluffy horse tail stretches out from his rear. Tustled ginger hair crowns an expression that seems gentle and caring, but based on how toned his body is, he'd likely have no trouble showing a tougher side when need be. On his groin sits a thick, furred sheath, with a sizable pair of balls dangling below. He isn't wearing anything to cover any of this up.";

			say "     You ask Fire about himself, and his past before all of this happened. He scowls a little, as if remembering some bad memories... 'Well... I mean, to start, Fire isn't even my real name. At least, I figure it isn't. I just... can't really seem to remember it anymore. Some things from before all this are starting to get a bit... fuzzy, y'know? Honestly, it kinda pisses me off. I dunno if it was getting kicked in the head by that unicorn, or what, but... well, it is what it is. Fire works fine for a name, I just wish I could still remember everything clearly.' He sighs, taking a swig from his glass. 'But, uhh... yeah, I think I told you I used to be a soldier. Served for a couple decades, did my duty, all of that stuff... I ended up retiring only a year ago or so, though. I'd seen enough of violence, and I wanted to settle down somewhere nice and quiet. Find a partner, relax and grow old together... you know, that kind of thing. I live on the outskirts of the city... or at least, I used to, before it all went to shit and got ruined. Sorta live here now, I guess.'";
			say "     'I dunno if I still want to do all that stuff. It's kinda hard to think about the future now... I certainly wouldn't want to bring a kid into this world, seeing as the only pastime now seems to be fucking as many different creatures as you can. Maybe if all this settles down, or if we manage to build a functioning society out of all of this... we'll see. Y'know guys can get pregnant now...? I've seen a couple of them down on the beach who, uhh... obviously had more than just chub on their figures. Weird to think about... I don't think I want any kids myself, but... I've had to consider what kinda person I'd want to be with now, seeing as how anyone can be packing just about anything!' Fire chuckles, blushing a little at the thought. 'Anyone'd be good, I think. I don't really mind what they've got, personally... so long as they're a good person, I'm cool with it.' He smiles at you. You wonder if perhaps he's insinuating anything by those comments... but decide to ask about that later, if you feel interested.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'How about you, though? What did you do before the apocalypse happened?' You describe what you were doing with your life before all of this, and how you found yourself at the bunker when all this started. '... Mmm, yeah. At least you've got somewhere safe enough to stay, too. If ya didn't, I might have offered a place with me! But, uhh... yeah, I'm glad you've got somewhere to be. Sounds big enough to bring anyone you want back there, too, and if it's defended well enough from random looters and passersby... well, good. And at least in the main city there aren't too many nasty critters lurking about... besides those wyverns, I guess. Can be pretty nasty if you aren't prepared to deal with 'em...' Fire trails off, a bit of a blush still on his face. You wonder whether that's from the worry he showed for you, or just from the drink. Regardless, you thank him for showing concern and reassure him that you're fine where you are and that nothing bad will happen to you. He smiles back earnestly, finishing his mug in one large gulp before replying. 'Well, yeah! I mean... I don't want anything happening to my new bud, heh. Just making sure you're safe.' You give him a big smile of your own, and the two of you chat for a few more minutes before you excuse yourself, telling him you'd be happy to chat more soon.";
		-- 2: [Chat 2]
			say "     You decide to ask Fire about his opinions on the current situation surrounding you all. You know he expressed annoyance at how wild everything is now and how everyone just wants to bang, but... is that all there was to it? The stallion sits down on the stool next to yours, resting his head in one of his hands and thinking. 'Well... I mean, I guess it's not all bad. In a way, it's sorta liberating, of course... now it's totally normal to walk around naked. I have to say, I do like that part... feels much more free. Especially with the wings and all, and the tail... it'd be a nightmare trying to find clothes that fit me! And, well... I guess it is kinda interesting seeing all the different infections that came out of all of this. There's some wild stuff... I still wonder how someone turns into one of those feral sea dragons down on the beach, or into one of those, uhh... pool toys I saw wandering around? Crazy stuff. I've accepted how I am now, and I kinda like it, I suppose... it's made me stronger, faster... I can fly if I want to. And then of course, I mean... it makes sex more interesting, I guess. But that's maybe a topic for another time...'";
			say "     '... I guess I do like that there's still enough of us around who are sane, and who are sort of... going through all of this together. I enjoy people watching, which is part of why I just sorta... hang out here and look at the various different patrons we get. There's a sort of... shared purpose, y'know? We're all in this shit together and we'll all make what we can of it, and get through it together. And, I guess, for most... it's an opportunity to let their wild side out and enjoy the apocalypse, heh.' You smile, nodding your head in agreement. There were definitely some silver linings to this whole thing, despite the struggles to survive and find enough food and water around...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     '... Saw something pretty entertaining the other day.' Fire smiles, recalling what had happened on the beach. 'One of those sea dragons came up onto the beach to try and find someone to fuck or eat or whatever. Only, the first thing it found was one of those living pool toys... the dragon shaped ones. Both of them had the same idea, obviously, and they went at it, beating each other this way and that... though, obviously, size and strength wins, right? Not in this case...' The alicorn grins. 'The sea dragon thought it had the upper hand when it was pushing all its weight down on the toy, but, surprise surprise... the air shifting around inside the thing made it shoot out to the side, and while the sea dragon was off balance, the pool toy went around and managed to mount the thing from behind! It was pretty funny to watch... pretty sure they both ended up enjoying it in the end, though.'";
			say "     You chuckle at the story, chugging down the rest of your drink while Fire laughs at the memory. It was pretty nice to have someone to chat with and share all of the weird things that happened in and around the city. You continue to talk with Fire about random topics for a while longer, before you notice the time and excuse yourself. He gives you a nod and smiles, letting you know he hoped to see you again soon.";
		-- 3: [Chat 3]
			say "     Deciding you'd just like to chat for now, you think for a second, before asking Fire if he has any interesting or funny stories to tell from his time spent people-watching. He ponders for a second, drumming the depths of his mind before coming up with something. 'Oh yeah, I've got one. There was this one time... it was a pretty quiet evening, we had a fair few people milling around, enjoying their drinks. Not much was going on... until this one guy bursts through the doors, his dick erect and trailing jizz everywhere, and yells out an order for the most expensive drink on the menu. Then, this other guy comes in right behind them, and tackles the first dude to the ground! They wrestle about on the floor for a bit, both of them looking like they literally just got done fucking, arguing about which one of them came first... turns out they'd made a bet that whichever of them came first owed the other free drinks for a month, or something. Neither of them particularly wanted to pay, though... heh. Had to chuck both of them out myself since they already seemed pretty wasted... and I didn't exactly want a bunch of drunkards turning the place into a wrestling ring.'";
			say "     You laugh along with Fire at the funny story, enjoying your drinks and the gossip you shared. In return, you tell him about some of the situations you've seen while exploring, and the fights between different creatures you'd been witness to. Nodding along with your tales, Fire seems to enjoy hearing more about how the world is outside of the restaurant and beach. He sips his drink slowly while listening to you, before he thinks of something else to share.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Oh, I got another... I was taking a walk one day along the beach. Everything was pretty normal, everyone was just hanging out as usual... but there was one chick surfing, and she wiped out pretty bad! Her board got washed up on the shore, but she didn't resurface along with it... obviously, sounds pretty bad right? I'm not exactly a lifeguard, but being pretty fit... I decided to see if she needed help, so I ran into the water and swam over to where she wiped out. I dove down under the surface to see if I could find her... and what do I see but the chick fucking herself silly on some coral that had grown into the vague shape of a dick? Seemed fine and didn't need my help... just insatiable. People nowadays... tch.' He shakes his head, chuckling at the memory and finishing his mug of beer. You tell each other another couple of stories each as you finish your drink, before you notice the time and get up from the stool. You tell him you'd love to chat some more later on, and with a reciprocated smile, you head off.";
		-- 4: [Chat 4]
			say "     Wanting to get to know the alicorn a bit better, you ask Fire if he has, or had any other hobbies besides the people-watching and volunteer bouncing. He settles into the stool next to you before beginning. 'Well... Not really anymore. The world being what it is now, there isn't really much you can do for recreation... besides the obvious. Though...' He stands, heading behind the bar and crouching down to retrieve something. Coming back around, he shows you - it's a small wooden statue, akin to a totem pole. It's quite intricate, clearly carved out of a larger chunk of wood rather than manufactured. 'I used to make these. Little idol things, just some small carvings... I used to like carpentry quite a lot. Still do, but... I mean, it's a fair bit harder to go out and find the tools I'd need to make things like that nowadays, not to mention the wood. Still, I've got a couple of them on me that I keep around in my bag... maybe for good luck, I dunno. I have some more back at my place. What do you think?'";
			say "     You smile and tell Fire that you like it a lot, and praise the quality of the craftsmanship. He grins back and picks the idol out of your hands, holding it in his lap and looking over it himself. 'Heh, thanks. It means a lot to me to have someone I can show this stuff to, y'know? I have to keep them kinda hidden away most of the time... don't want them getting stolen, or cummed all over or something! So, uh... what about you?'";
			say "     You and Fire talk for a while longer about hobbies and interests, and lament the fact that in the current world around you, you can't exactly spend too much time on leisure outside of pleasure. After a bit, you decide to part ways, giving Fire and smile and a wave as you depart.";
		-- 5: [Chat 5]
			say "     You decide to ask Fire about some of his experiences being a volunteer bouncer for the restaurant. You know how rowdy people can get nowadays, after all... you imagine he probably has some interesting stories to tell! He nods straight away. 'Oh yeah, for sure. I mean, if people aren't currently banging... they're probably just looking for their next fuck, right? That seems to be what most people are looking for at least when they come in. Okay, one time a girl comes in and sits next to another, and they both start flirting with one another. They buy a few drinks for each other, get totally hammered... and then, being real drunk, ask if they can use one of the back rooms to have a 'sleep' in. Off they go... until a few minutes later, when I hear some yelling coming from back there, and what sounds like stuff getting thrown around!";
			say "     I was about to go back there to check what the hell was happening, when both of them storm out of the room, yelling... one running away from the other. From what I could gather from the slurred screaming... both of them thought the other had a dick and they were both expecting to get fucked after all the drink buying, only to find out they were both just women! Wouldn't seem like a big deal to me, but after getting so shitfaced... both of them seemed pretty irate at getting 'tricked' by the other. I didn't even have to kick them out after that... they ended up chasing each other out and going off to fight someplace else. Either that, or they went to go find someone to fill both of them out... I don't even know, heh. I don't see why it was such a big deal - I mean, you can hardly walk around nowadays without tripping over the dick of someone who wants a quick fuck. But some people get wacky when they're drunk...'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     He shrugs, taking a swig of his own drink before continuing. 'It's why I don't like to drink too much myself - I usually stick to only one or two, and only socially - like I have with you! It's nice having someone around to just chat to, like old times... before all this, when people'd go down to bars with friends for a night out.' He grins as he reminisces. 'Though, when I used to get drunk back then... I'd wake up and I couldn't remember a single thing from the night before, no matter how hard I tried! It's why I mostly cut down now... no good doing fun shit and not being able to remember a second of it after, heh. Maybe when the world gets fixed... if it ever does, we can go back to being careless like we used to.' He sighs at the thought, then offers you a weak smile. You give him a sympathetic one of your own, giving him a pat or two on his fuzzy shoulder for reassurance, which he seems to appreciate. You finish up your drink while telling him about the things you used to do for fun with your friends before the infections broke out, which he enjoys. Afterwards, you grab your stuff and head out after telling him you'd be happy to come back for more chats soon.";
		-- 6: [Chat 5]
			say "     You think of a question that seems a little silly to ask, but decide to do it anyway. You ask Fire if the horn on his head can do anything special, or if it's just for show. He raises an eyebrow at the question, before you explain to him that unicorns had been depicted in a lot of media as having magical powers that seemed to stem from their horns. He chuckles, taking a swig of his drink before answering you. 'Might surprise you, but actually... yeah, kinda, heh.' He begins. 'Not magic, per se, but... well, I can do a couple things. Y'know all the nanites that caused this shit...? I can sorta... manipulate them a little bit with this.' He reaches up, tapping a finger against the horn on his head. 'Not much, before you ask. And it only really extends to my own body. I can't change my species or anything, or grow gigantic, or anything like that, but... I can do small stuff. You know, make my muscles bigger, or my dick, or anything like that. I don't know why, maybe unicorns do have magic powers... but if I concentrate hard enough on it, I can do stuff like that. It takes a bit for it to work though, heh... and I've gotta be in a good mood. But hey... it's something!'";
			say "     He smiles at you before drinking, chugging down the rest of his glass before thumping it down on the bar with a thud. 'Maybe it'll come in properly useful someday! Makes me wonder... if the world ever goes back to normal, I wonder what we'll all do? Maybe we'll all get jobs fitting our transformations, or something... that is, if we don't turn back. I dunno if the world will be like this forever, or if 'humans' will end up back as the dominant species, or form, or whatever... but I guess we'll have to see. I imagine things like wings would be in fairly popular demand for the utility they'd bring...' The two of you continue pondering the state of the outside world for a while while you finish your drink, before you eventually stretch and get yourself up off of the stool, starting to say your goodbyes for now. Fire smiles up at you and nods, getting up himself and heading over to his favorite spot against the wall to lean against, before giving you a small wave as you head back out into the world.";

I haven't in a while, but I used to win these kinds of contests all the time!' he boasts, ordering the first round of drinks for the two of you to get started with.

Another round up, and you're starting to slow down a bit... you weren't that thirsty anymore, and you were beginning to feel the effects of the booze on your head. Fire seemed pretty unperturbed, merely smiling at you and chugging down his third mug... though, it did take him slightly longer for that one. He notices your slowing pace, and laughs a little, giving you a wide, toothy grin. 'C'mon, you can't be giving up yet! You're not THAT much of a lightweight, surely...' he teases, chuckling at you as you finish your third mug. You assure him that you can handle your drink, and handle more of it, and he laughs before ordering round number four.

You start knocking back your next glass, stopping midway through to breathe and let out a belch before resuming. He laughs at the sight, finishing his own mug and putting it down on the bar... though, he wobbles a little as he does so, giggling drunkenly.

Musta drunk wayyy too much... urgh, this is why I don't like doing that nowadays...' You comfort the other male, patting him on the back as you force yourself up and out of the bed. You should probably get back to your usual activities, after all... as tempting as it was to laze around recovering with Fire, you had things you needed to do. You tell Fire as much, and he nods to you, grunting in pain as he does so. 'Heh, fine... we must have had some fun last night, clearly - I wouldn't drink this much otherwise normally. Feel free to come back for more anytime...' he mumbles, before turning over in the bed and letting you depart.";

Your own cock quivers underneath your belly, twitching needily and starting to leak as he slams his groin into your ass over and over[else]. Your cunt drips needily onto the sheets, ignored yet still wet as Fire pounds your ass[end if]. Over and over he thrusts, his fat balls slapping noisily against your groin as he pounds into you as hard as he can, too drunk to really care about being gentle.

Looking into the mirror, you can see Fire's horn starting to glow... you didn't know if it was intentional or not, but he was clearly doing something! As he continues pounding into you, you feel your body starting to tingle all over as you slowly begin shrinking and changing. As he strokes over your sides, you begin to realize that his touch felt... very good. Sexually good. He moans more as he keeps fucking your ass, and you begin to feel your body starting to twitch along with his cock inside you. You slowly keep shrinking, and as you do, you can see your body starting to turn black in the mirror.

As the nanites within you work to convert you into more horse meat, your vision starts to dim slightly, making it harder to see yourself in the mirror - but you can see enough to look at your body, nearly fully transformed into horse cock. Your flesh turns shiny and black, and your facial features slowly start disappearing... succumbing to the transformation and Fire's drunken command. Your limbs, already mere stumps where they used to be, begin merging into your body as you let out another happy gurgle of pleasure. You can feel more pre welling up inside you, spurting out of your mouth as your head transforms into the huge, flared head of his cock.";

You spurt his fat load out of your mouth, jizzing rope after rope of cum out onto the bedsheets and the floor beyond. Fire moans in happiness as his orgasm seems to last minutes, and every second of that time is an orgasm of your own. His own pleasure wracks your entire body, and the feeling of him cumming is essentially the same to you now as cumming yourself. Part of you wants that feeling to never end... but eventually, his orgasm slowly peters out, his thick ropes of jizz becoming a mere trickle of cum onto the bed.";

Almost entirely... because his hands wrap back around your length, beginning to pump up and down on his new and improved shaft. You've added quite a lot of mass to it, making his dick twice the length and girth it was before... and every inch of that throbbing pole of meat was twitching in glee as he jerks you off. You can still faintly see, in a way, and you can watch his red hands moving up and down your shiny black length, your flesh wrinkling and stretching as he pumps up and down. You twitch and throb needily, wanting to spurt out another orgasm, and you see Fire put his head back onto the pillow and let out a long, low groan of pleasure as he massages up and down his shaft.";
					say "     Eventually, you feel another load welling up inside you, and it isn't long before you're shooting ropes of spunk out of your mouth yet again. It feels amazing, and as your entire body pulses and writhes in joy, you wonder if this could last forever...";

Now fully spent, the tiredness from a night of drinking and debauchery had caught up with him... and as he drifts off to sleep, the same feeling overtakes you. Despite the nanites tirelessly continuing to work away inside you, working to convert your entire being into nothing more than shiny cock flesh, your consciousness fades along with Fire's as you dream of the days to come.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Many, many hours later, Fire comes to, lifting his hand up to his forehead and groaning in pain as the hangover greets him. Grunting in pain, he sits up, yawning and sleepily opening his eyes. 'Urgh... now I know why I stopped drinking so much. What did I even do last night...?' he mumbles to himself, stretching and shuffling down the bed, moving to sit on the edge of it in front of the mirror. His cock was hanging out, a typical case of morning wood... and at the sight of how enormous it was now, Fire's eyes went wide. 'What the hell? Was my drink spiked or something...? This is... huge...'";
					say "     His hands move to wrap around his length. Overnight, you had been entirely converted into horse cock by the nanites, and not much was left of you in there - but a part of you lives on, merged with his shaft and living for nothing but pleasure. To your delight, he starts stroking you again, his hands gliding up and down his supple flesh experimentally as he tests out his new, improved length. He lets out a low moan, the feeling from his enormous shaft far more sensitive now... it felt amazing, far better than jerking off had felt before. Slowly, he moves to grab something from his bedside table, packaging rustling for a few seconds before you feel something wrapping around your head. He slowly slides a thick, extra large condom down your body, the latex wrapping around your form and gently squeezing you in a pleasurable manner... though, with his length now being far bigger, the condom only went a little over half-way down his shaft before running out of length.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Fire shakes his head, making a mental note to go find some new ones in a bigger size later... but for now, he goes back to stroking himself off. The many nerves that covered your sensitive, black flesh were on fire, in ecstasy from both the latex wrapped around you and, more importantly, his big hands sliding up and down your length. You were already beginning to leak pre, filling the end of the condom with a few spurts of the stuff, and it wasn't long before the pleasure got to Fire - he began pumping his shaft up and down with renewed vigor, determined to take care of his morning wood as quickly as he could. You were practically seeing stars as your body felt like it was exploding in delight, and it was only a few mere moments more before he began cumming.";
					say "     Fire threw his head back and moaned loudly, his dick pulsating and twitching as it pumped rope after rope into the condom, the end of the thing drooping down like a water balloon. His orgasm lasts a minute or so, filling the condom almost to breaking point... every second of that orgasm was an endless amount of pleasure for your writhing form. After eventually recovering, Fire lets out a long sigh and tugs the condom off, tying the end of it up and dumping it to the side to deal with later. 'Damn... this size is a bit big, but... god if that didn't feel amazing... I've gotta find out what I drank to make this happen.' he murmurs to himself, idly caressing your length. Now fully spent, you slowly begin shrinking back into his sheath over the next few minutes as Fire goes about his morning routine.";

Now filled with the lust and libido of two whole people, he finds himself getting hard a lot more often than before... and with how pleasurable jerking off is for him now, he doesn't mind at all taking the time to sneak off to his room and tease another fat load out of you. Every orgasm is better than the last, and every rope of jizz you spurt out for him feels magnitudes better than the orgasms you used to have. And thankfully for you... it'd stay that way for good, with Fire never realizing the reality of where you had ended up. For you, however... you were more than happy with your new life, loving every second of the pleasure he gives you. As the days turn to weeks, and then months, you slowly forget all about who you were before, or the fact you'd even been anything BUT his fat dick... existing only to pleasure both you and him - and that was just perfect for you.";

You do so, grabbing your drink and belongings and following him behind the bar, and down a small corridor off to the side. You could see one door leading into the kitchens, but on the other side of the corridor, there was another door... which he led you towards. Going in, you found a small bedroom! There was a double bed, a couple of nightstands, and a couch to relax on, which Fire promptly sits down on and beckons you towards.

I guess it was probably made for the manager of the restaurant or whatever, but it's mine now. Anyway, how about we finish our drinks first before we... get started?' He gives you a smile, and a knowing wink. You nod, sitting down beside him on the couch. It was a fairly small two-seater, and with Fire's built up body, you had to get pretty close to him in order to fit... your thighs pressed against his own, and you could feel the warmth radiating from his fuzzy body. He didn't seem to mind at all, though, and was happily sipping away at his drink while you settled into position.";

I'm just imagining how this'll feel...' he remarks, leaning back and relaxing on the seat, making it so his groin was pointed straight upwards. You quickly finish up the rest of your mug, wanting both hands free for what was to come... and as soon as you put it down on the side table, you reach across and gently begin to stroke your hands along Fire's length. His cock twitches and quivers under your touch, more of it slipping free until his entire foot-long length was out and stiffening up in your grasp.";

It was hot, and just the right amount of slimy after being packed away in his sheath until now. The stallion lets out a loud sigh of air from his nostrils, closing his eyes and clearly enjoying the feeling of you stroking his length. As his cock pulsated in your grip, the veins bulging out of it prominently, you began to speed up a little, now jerking him off in earnest. [if Player is Herm]The act was making your own shaft stiffen up, standing to attention in your lap but unfortunately ignored, for now[else]You could feel your cunt starting to moisten at the experience, clearly readying itself for what was to come[end if].";

He beckons you over to the bed, and you quickly get up and shuffle over, laying down right in the middle and rolling over to face upwards. Fire climbs up over you, his large body and wings blocking out the light from above and ensuring all you could see was him. His cock was twitching and ready, aimed right towards your cunt as he held himself over you. 'Ready...?' he asks, waiting for you to give him the go ahead.";
	say "     After a moment's hesitation, you nod, giving him the signal to begin. Fire smiles, and pushes downwards, pushing his flared head against your pussy. There was a small amount of resistance as your hole adjusts to his size, but he manages to slip in quickly and several inches of his shaft follow. You let out a moan already, feeling yourself stretching to accommodate the stallion's huge horse cock... to which Fire grins, and starts to thrust back and forth into you properly. With each push, he shoves another half-inch of cockmeat into you, gradually getting his entire shaft into your pussy and making your belly begin to bulge. Fire begins grunting with his thrusts, enjoying the pleasure as your wet cunt grips his shaft, and you moan again as you feel his flared head pressing against the wall of your womb, filling you utterly full and leaking pre inside you.";

The room fills with the sounds of wet slapping, flesh smacking against flesh as he thrusts his entire length into you, pulling back only half-way each time before surging forwards once more. His full balls slap against your taint, letting you know the size of the load he'd be filling you with. With each thrust, the ring around the middle of his shaft pulls out, stretching you a little more every time and making you whimper in pleasure, right before he thrusts it back in[if Player is Herm]. Forgotten about, your shaft smacks against your belly every time he shoves his body against your own, drooling precum onto your body[end if].";
	say "     Fire's grunts grow louder, and he starts pistoning into your pussy with abandon. Your lips quiver around his cock, and you can feel that the both of you are getting close. The stallion's massive shaft was spearing you wide, and with its size, it was easy for him to hit your g-spot every time he slams into you. You squeeze your eyes shut and moan loudly, begging for him to fuck you as hard as he can. Fire does exactly that, letting out a moan of his own as his cock leaks even more pre within you, giving you a taste of the load to come.";

As Fire embraces you, you feel your cunt begin to tingle a little, a feeling that radiates outwards across your whole body. Soon enough, you feel it all across your form, as Fire's influence over the nanites increases and begins to take form. Looking down at yourself, you can see your body beginning to shrink in towards his crotch, and you feel your hands slip away from where you were holding onto him. As the feeling of change takes over your whole body, you throw your head back and let out a moan, but when you do so, you find that you can't move it afterward! Your limbs slowly start disappearing, merging into your body as your entire being is transformed around Fire's cock, your flesh starting to shift and darken, slowly turning to a shiny black color, much like his shaft.";
	say "     Fire groans loudly, loving the feeling of your body merging with his own, and he continues thrusting into you the whole while. Eventually, though, as more and more of your form is converted into cockflesh, that turns to thrusting you directly, as Fire shifts his stance and wraps his hands around your sides. Starting to jerk up and down, he pleasures the both of you as you find that his movements bring you closer and closer to orgasm, despite just stroking over your 'sides'. After a couple more seconds, you find that you can't really move much at all anymore... only twitch and squirm, a movement that pleases Fire greatly and causes him to let out a louder groan of ecstasy! You can feel the orgasm welling up within you, and it's all you can focus on even as your facial features start to slowly disappear, your vision beginning to blur and fade slightly as your head is slowly subsumed by his growing shaft.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As your body slowly finishes merging with Fire's shaft, fully becoming nothing but shiny black dickflesh like the rest of it, your orgasms become one, and Fire yells loudly as he begins shooting ropes through your form, spurting jet after jet of spunk out of your 'mouth' and painting one of the walls of the room white with stallion jizz. He continues stroking you all the while, and to you... it's one of the best orgasms you've ever had, one that wracks over your entire form and leaves you twitching and pulsing in his grasp. Fire pants loudly, catching his breath after his stream of cum slows, and he gives you another stroke, a slow, loving touch. 'Heh... Sorry about that. Can't quite control myself when I get too riled up... don't worry. I'll let you out in a bit...' He says, smiling down at you while idly caressing you up and down. You try to reply, but find that all you can do is quiver and let out another trickle of jizz, a movement that causes Fire to chuckle. 'Mmm, god... I do love how you look between my legs, [name of player]. We oughta do this more often... you make for a good horse cock, you know?'";
	say "     If you had any cheeks to do it, you'd find yourself blushing at the remark. Fire continues to fondle you, spending a few minutes simply stroking you slowly and paying attention to every inch of your form... you had made his cock far bigger, after all, and he wanted to enjoy it. His hands explored all the way down from your flared head, slowly stroking down your whole, now two-foot form and tracing over the bulging veins in your body... It was an experience he loved, and the one part of the nanite-filled apocalypse he enjoyed. He gripped your base firmly, pulling his hands upwards along your shaft while squeezing you tightly, wringing out the last few drops of his orgasm and watching as they trickled down your sides and clung to your sticky head. You pulsed gently one last time, now fully spent. After a few more moments of him showing you his affections, you could feel your body starting to go limp, and soft... your form slowly beginning to shrink as Fire's dick began to go flaccid. While you retreat slowly back into his sheath, Fire lays down on the bed, his horn beginning to glow gently while he closes his eyes for a short nap...";

	say "     A short while later, you awaken, back in your usual body again! You're laying in Fire's embrace, his arms wrapped around your torso while he spoons you, keeping you nice and warm, while his sheath and balls press gently against your groin. Seeing you awake, Fire smiles at you kindly, pulling back a little to talk to you. 'Good, you're awake! Sorry again, heheh... I just get really worked up when I'm getting close to cumming, and what happened is, uhh... the natural reaction that usually ends up happening. Still... hope you enjoyed it, and I meant what I said...~' he teases, stroking one of his hands down your front in much the same manner as he did before. 'Maybe if you want to, you can come back and we can... do it again. Or something else...'";

You lay happily in his embrace for a few more minutes, cherishing your intimate time with him, before you eventually force yourself to get up and get ready to head back out into the world. Fire does the same, getting up with a stretch and heading to the bathroom to wash himself off before returning to the restaurant... but not before cleaning up the mess the two of you made all over the room. Giving him a wave as you depart, you ponder to yourself what a unique experience that whole thing was...";

Bobbing downward slightly, you coat the first several inches of fat shaft with saliva, your tongue swirling around his head and pressing against his fat flare in order to properly lubricate it as much as you can.

Fire chuckles, one of his hands patting your head gently as he stands, his cock almost slapping you in the face from the sudden motion. 'Well... go ahead and lay down. I suppose we should get started...'";
	say "     Clambering up onto his bed, you lay down on your front, ass raised up into the air as you turn your head to look back at him. The bed creaks as Fire climbs up onto it behind you, kneeling down between your legs and flopping his huge cock down between your cheeks, most of his length spilling out onto your back. He reaches over to the small nightstand next to the bed, opening a drawer and pulling out a small bottle of lube, before squirting a hefty helping of the stuff onto his length and beginning to massage it in, focusing especially on the lower half. He looks up at you while doing so, a sly smile gracing his features. 'Heh... I mean, as much as you helped, I don't think you got everything. And, well... I'm big. Gotta make sure this doesn't hurt... too much, for ya.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You swallow in response, giving him a little nod as he finishes up his preparation. 'Alright... ready?' he asks, to which you can merely give him another small nod, your heart pounding in your chest as you await the inevitable. Fire nods back to you, smile wide as he pulls back, his length slipping free from your cheeks as he begins lining up with your hole... and then the pressure builds. His head presses against your pucker, straining to get in, and you can feel the resistance of your tight ring trying to stop the intrusion... but as pressure continues to mount, Fire presses harder, your hands grip the sheets below you... and finally, with a slick pop, his head eventually manages to push past your resistance and into your hole. Fire lets out a pleased sigh, and you almost bite your lip trying to cope with such a wide presence inside of you[if Player is Male]. Your cock[smn] quiver needily under you, throbbing and pulsing as he finally fits inside of you, leaking pre onto his previously clean sheets[else]. Your pussy aches needily, almost as if craving to be filled instead of your rear, moistness almost dripping from it already[end if].";
	say "     '... Huff. Alright, that's that... going to start moving now...' Fire mutters, slowly starting to push forwards into you. With the hard part over and done with, it was easy for him to simply push forward, his length sliding deeper into you seemingly easily... seeing as his head was practically the widest part of his shaft, it didn't take much for him to push more in. After half a foot of dick was buried within your depths, you met his medial ring, the ridge around his shaft providing you with a little more trouble... but Fire slowly places his hands on your sides, holding onto you and pushing firmly, quickly managing to break past your resistance once more and shove his ring into your ass[if Player is Male]. Each firm push he does like that causes your dick[smn] to bounce, globs of pre spraying off of them as his pushes rock your body forward[end if].";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     One smooth, gradual push later... and Fire hilts himself inside of you. His warm crotch presses against your ass, his fat, shiny nuts practically clenching and throbbing as they warm your taint. You feel bloated, your stomach feeling like it was practically bulging out as you hold his foot long meat inside of you... you're merely trying to settle down and adjust to his immense size. Your arms and legs quiver from the strain of such an intrusion, and it was all you could do to get past the uncomfortableness of such a large shaft filling you... but it feels amazing. After giving you a couple more moments, Fire lets out a little snort, gripping your sides tighter and starting to pull back out. 'Heh... good job. Alright, hope you're ready...'";
	say "     Slowly, he pulls his length back out, past the medial ring... emptiness fills your body, like a void where his shaft once was. Soon enough though, he fills it right back up, surging forwards and gently slapping his groin against your own with a quiet, moist slap. The stallion holds onto you tightly as he begins to fuck you properly... pulling back and shoving forwards in smooth motions, his speed picking up now as he settles into a regular pistoning motion[if Player is Male]. Your cock[smn] throb and twitch, hard as diamonds, and leak all over the bed below you[else]. Your pussy practically cries out in need, begging to be filled, wet femcum starting to build and slowly drip from your moist opening[end if]. Fire's thrusts rock you back and forth, the bed creaking beneath the two of you as it adds to the growing noisiness in the room. Your moans of pleasure are joined by Fire, the stallion snorting and let out soft whinnies of ecstasy as he bucks himself against your trembling form.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Fire speeds up again, and with every thrust, it feels like he's leaving more and more of his length inside you. Pulling out only a small amount before pistoning back in, the alicorn grips you tighter and tighter as he shoves you forward and back, your body moving with his thrusts as he buries himself within you, length barely leaving your hole now. Your limbs tremble as you feel like you can barely hold yourself up, your strength seeming to fail as you crumple down onto the bed below you... or at least, you would have, had Fire not been holding you up. The stallion continues bucking, letting out moans of joy as he holds you tight, his hands starting to travel up and down your sides as he moves the two of you. Slowly, your entire body fills with a sort of gentle tingling sensation... the nanites within the horse beginning their work as Fire closes in on his orgasm. Your limbs slowly begin to shrink away, starting to retract back into your body as your form gradually begins to be absorbed into Fire's massive, throbbing cock[if Player is Male]. Almost as if it was their last chance, your dick[smn] begins spurting, ropes shooting out from your groin as you cum from the pleasure of both the filling, and the transformation[else]. Your pussy drips in fem cum, as if trying to get it all out before it fades, as you experience a shaky, trembling orgasm[end if].";
	say "     Fire's hands pump up and down your length as your body begins to change color, and texture... your skin becoming supple and leathery, your color shifting to a dark, shiny black... much the same as the stallion's huge shaft. As more and more of your body converts into dark cockflesh, Fire speeds up his thrusts, your body shoving back and forth in the air as his hands jerk up and down your sides. He was close... you both were, since you could feel his orgasm welling up deep within your body. You twitch and throb, your entire form aching in need, desperate to cum... and as your facial features slowly begin to fade, becoming subsumed by the growing flesh of his immense shaft... you let it all out, the stallion neighing and crying out as he blasts the wall behind his bed with a gigantic load of cum. Rope after rope shoots out of you, the cock slit that was previously your mouth spurting out what feels like liters of jizz as Fire's orgasm goes on and on... lasting a solid minute or two before he slowly begins to calm down.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The alicorn slowly slumps down onto the bed, knees weak after such a mind-blowing orgasm. He looks down at you with a smile, his hands gently kneading into your supple flesh as he slowly pumps you up and down, milking the last of his load out of your body. You merely tremble and twitch under his touch, finding yourself unable to do much to express yourself or your lust other than attempting to wriggle and pulse in his hands. 'Haaaa... aah, I can never get over how that feels. S-Sorry about that, heh... I... can't exactly stop that from happening when I cum. It just... feels too damn good. Don't worry, heh... I'll turn you back. Just gimme a min...' Any reply you try to make merely comes out as another throb, the last few little spurts of cream squeezing out of your head. Fire rewards you for your dedication, stroking you up and down a good few more times, really making sure to milk every last little bit out of his tight nuts. 'Hrrf... y'know, we should do this more often. You look good on my groin... and I think my cock looks good on you, too.' Fire teases, smiling down at your twitching form as he idly strokes you. If you could, you'd likely blush at such a remark, but... alas, that would have to wait.";
	say "     When the strength in his legs returns, Fire gets up from the bed and goes to admire your form in front of the mirror. You can still sort of see... your vision darkened, and seen through his own, but you were able to see what you had become. Nothing more than more black, shiny flesh... your mass having added another foot to his cock, your newly grown form standing proud between his legs. The stallion strokes over you proudly, allowing you to bask in how amazing you looked like this... the sight alone made you squirm and throb, clearly excited. With a chuckle, Fire steps back and flops down onto the bed, exhausted after all that fun. 'Heh... t-though, doing that really takes it out of me. Don't worry... I'll turn you back... just, let me have a short nap...' he murmurs, closing his eyes and relaxing back onto sticky sheets. Your body slowly begins to shrink, your previously huge length slowly tightening up as you retreat back into his sheath... and as your new form was slowly packed away into his groin, the tiredness washes over you as well, and everything goes black.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     ... Shortly after, you feel everything returning. You open your eyes slowly, looking around... you're still in Fire's room, safe and sound in his arms as he nuzzles into your back. Your movements stir the stallion, his eyes slowly opening alongside you as he caresses your form... you were back to how you were previously! Everything was intact, thankfully... though, Fire teases you by stroking his hands over your hips, gently caressing you as if you were still his. 'Mmm... that was fun, phew. Sorry about that, again, but... I hope you enjoyed it, heheh. You certainly seemed to, down there... and, like I said... that was a good look for you. If you want... come back anytime I'd be happy to give you another go...~'";
	say "     You smile back at him, assuring him that you did indeed enjoy your time with him, and that you'd think about his offer. Satisfied, the two of you snuggle for a few more minutes, before duty calls and you pry yourself from his warm embrace. Understanding that you had to leave, Fire gets up too, the two of you heading first to the bathroom to wash up before going back to the restaurant. As you go to leave, you give Fire one last wave and a knowing smile, which the stallion eagerly returns, having enjoyed his time with you very much.";

	say "     Knowing exactly what Fire is capable of... you decide to ask him if you could get straight to the fun, and have him transform you into his shaft. His eyes widen just a little, and he takes a moment to consider before replying. 'Uh huh... most people I've been with don't ask for another go, seeing as it's a little too 'weird' for them, heh. But I mean... if you want to, then be my guest.~ I'm sure we can make this very fun for the both of us...' The stallion begins walking to the hall, leading the way back to the room you were now familiar with. You find your heart beating faster as you follow him, knowing exactly what you were signing up for... the thought of how this would go makes you excited. As you enter Fire's room, the alicorn sits down on his couch, relaxing back and letting you see his package, his growing shaft already at half-mast between his legs. Clearly, he's just as excited about the prospect of a willing participant in this particular transformation as you are.";
	say "     'Well... heh. How about you give me a little something to get this going... it's a lot easier for me to... 'lose control' and get the changing started when I'm getting worked up, y'know? So, uhh... feel free to do your thing.' Fire says to you, a coy smile on his lips. Knowing exactly what he was wanting... you nod gently, before slowly sauntering closer and kneeling down between his strong legs. Fire sees what you're wanting, and shifts his stance, spreading his legs wider and planting his hooves down on the carpet to the sides of you, shifting forward on the seat to thrust his hardening shaft right towards your face. You reach forward, raising your hands to meet him and wrapping them gently around his enormous horse cock, feeling it twitch and throb under your touch. Gingerly wrapping your fingers around his dick, you slowly start to pump it back and forth... loving the feeling of his fat dick tensing in your grip, his medial ring pressing gently against the palm of one of your hands.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You move your head closer, barely an inch away from the flaring tip of his penis... close enough to feel the warmth emanating from it against your face. Still, close enough wasn't quite close enough in this case... so you open your maw and push forwards, slathering your tongue over the head of his shaft. The stallion lets out a pleased snort of air, one of his hands slowly moving down to you and pressing against the back of your head. For now, he gently rubs you, as if in appreciation for the attention you're giving him... but after a couple of moments, he gently starts pushing you further down onto his shaft, his head straining against your teeth for a second before squeezing between your jaws and deeper into your mouth. You let out a muffled moan of pleasure as his fat head fills you, forcing your jaws wide and ensuring that you had to take this slowly... but such a speed was perfectly fine for the both of you at this point.";
	say "     Fire allows you some time to adjust to the strain, letting off on pushing you any deeper, but once you appear ready enough... he resumes pressing you forwards, his strong palm guiding you down his shaft at a slow but steady pace. You manage to fit about half of his cock into your mouth before you hit your next roadblock... his medial ring teases against your lips while his fat flare presses firmly against the tight entrance to your throat, right at the back of your mouth. It seems almost impossible to go further, his shaft seemingly too big to fit down into your gullet, but the alicorn didn't seem fussed - in fact, his second hand joins his first, rubbing over the back of your head before moving gingerly down to your neck. 'Alright... let me help you out. Just take a deep breath through your nose and relax as much as you can... let me do the rest.~'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You can merely mumble out some muffled moans in response, his dick far too big to let you talk, but you do what he says and relax as best you can. You try your best to loosen your throat, and Fire grips you a little harder, slowly ramping up the pressure against your opening as he pushes forward with growing intensity. The stallion grits his teeth gently as he pushes against you, pressure mounting as he manhandles you carefully, pushing and maneuvering you into the best position he could... and finally, after a few moments and plenty of force, his head pushes hard enough to pop into your tight throat with a wet shove inside of you. The squeezing of your tight gullet around his shaft has him already leaking pre directly down your esophagus, milking his shaft as he pants in pleasure. 'Heh... good job. Now... hope you're ready...'";
	say "     Whether you were or not, Fire's now pushing deeper into your throat. The hardest part out of the way, it was easy for him to slide his fat dick further down your throat, your maw stretching wide as you take not only his medial ring down into your gullet, but the rest of his shaft too... and within only a few more moments, your nose bumps lightly against his fluffy groin. His balls tense against your lower jaw, and the horse huffs and shifts his hands down your body, tracing them lightly against your form until they settle around your sides. By now, he's standing over you, hands holding onto your body firmly as he adjusts the both of you into as comfortable of a position as he can - and then you begin to feel that familiar tingling sensation all over your body, radiating outwards from within. Fire grins, continuing to pant happily, and his hands begin gently stroking along your hips.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Oh... god, I can't wait. I've been dreaming about this moment again... I love how you look down there. You really were meant to be horse cock, [player]...' the stallion huffs out at you, clearly enjoying himself as the changes gradually begin. Though, seeing as you're facing backwards this time... you realize this might make for an interesting experience unlike your first encounter. You emit muted grunts and moans, pleasure heightening across your entire being as everything seems to grow more intense... it felt like you were not only sucking him off, but being sucked off at the same time... as if you were the shaft within your own mouth. Your eyes close as waves of joy crash over you, your body starting to lift gently off of the ground as Fire flexes, tensing his immense shaft and leaning back to wrench you free from the carpet as your limbs slowly begin to recede into your body.";
	say "     You give each of them one final wiggle, flailing them gently about as you begin to lose feeling in them... and not just feeling, but color too. Your flesh darkens, blotches of black, supple cock flesh appearing on your form, growing outwards and joining up with one another as the changes slowly take over your entire body. You try to wriggle about, to squirm in pleasure, and the movements merely make the stallion's fat shaft bob up and down in the air as it absorbs your body. Fire's hands stroke up and down, jerking over your sides, the feeling of his touch only growing more and more intense with every moment as your sides merge into the sides of his own cock, his stroking becoming even easier for him as your flesh glides up and down more freely[if Player is Male]. Below you, your neglected cock[smn] twitches and wobbles about, the pleasure coursing through you causing your own orgasm to pump out of you while it still could, cum painting the bottom of his couch with rope after rope, before your member[smn] proceeds to slowly be absorbed back into your loins[else]. Your pussy[smn] quivers and drips, the pleasure of the moment rushing through your body and making you practically drip all over the floor beneath you. Slowly, your folds begin closing up, flesh melding against itself as it's absorbed gradually into the horse's prick[end if].";

Fire trails off, panting louder and losing himself in the pleasure of the experience as he starts stroking over you faster and faster. You couldn't do much but squirm with joy under him, the movements making his dick twitch and throb. Your body is almost completely assimilated by now, nanites working tirelessly to convert your form fully into nothing more than living cock meat, the climax of which was fast approaching as your facial features begin to slowly fade... your vision blurs, starting to darken as your head began to melt into his groin, merging down with the base of his girthy, throbbing shaft. You can barely make a noise anymore, most of your attempts at communication or action merely wobbling his fat cock about, and the noise of his thrusts was becoming more and more muffled...";
	say "     ... and finally, with a roaring climax, Fire begins spurting his well-deserved orgasm out of his new and improved cock, all over the door to the room. His length now doubled, his hands grip your sides tightly and squeezed, milking every last rope out of his balls he could. You can feel his orgasm flowing through your entire being, pleasure rocking your body as every inch of you filled with ecstasy, the feeling almost unbearable as you writhe in joy in one of the most all-consuming orgasms you'd ever experienced. You can feel his seed spurting through your form, as if he was pumping it right down your throat... and out the other end, rope after rope shooting out of your hole in your flared 'rear'. Moments seem to draw out into an almost unbearable eternity of joy... until at last, the pleasure finally begins subsiding slowly as Fire pants, hands squeezing against your sides and milking the last of his cum out of you.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     There's a few moments of quiet, the silence broken only by Fire panting gently above you. Slowly, your feelings begin to return... though, you were experiencing everything through Fire as a proxy. You could see yourself now, through his eyes... your immense, throbbing form leaking gently over the carpet as he looks you over. His hands, before jerking you off feverishly, now gingerly caressed you up and down, exploring every inch of his new, bigger prick. The veins were more prominent, his ring protruding out of his shaft more, and the entire thing was far larger, girthier... better. The stallion chuckles breathlessly, holding you in his palms as he tests the weight of your body.";
	say "     'Huff... hrfff... h-heh. Whew, that sure was something... and I bet it felt amazing for you too down there, huh?' He murmurs, his voice rumbling through your being as if heard directly in your mind. You wish you could reply, but... as usual, you can merely make yourself throb and pulse beneath his touch, to which Fire chuckles. '... I'll take that as a yes. God... I said it before, but you really do make the most amazing cock, [name of player]. We'll have to do this more often... Now... I changed you back too soon before. I want to really... experience you this time. And I'm sure you're gonna love every moment...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Fire slowly trudges over to his bed, flopping down on the edge of it with a loud creak of mattress springs. He faces the mirror, leaning back and pointing his shaft upwards, towards the ceiling... ensuring that you can see every little inch of your new body, both in the reflection, and through his own eyes. His hands grip your pliable skin, fingers squeezing into your form and causing your flesh to wrinkle and squish under them, your entire body firm but malleable. He smiles as he takes in your entire length... the sort of cock that might not be too outlandish out in the city, but for him, was a rare sight indeed. Fire begins slowly experimenting with different levels of flexing your form, twitching you up out of his hands, then letting you flop back down into them... every movement sending throbs of pleasure through your body. 'You sure are heavy like this... even for a horse dick, heh. And... you're even big enough for me to...'";
	say "     After a few more moments, the stallion leans in, his snout pressing gently against you, near the top of your length. His tongue comes out, gently slathering a small trail along your flesh... letting him taste the flavor of your shiny, black self. After a moment, he retracts, smiling and beginning to slowly pump his hands up and down you once more. 'I'm not much of a bottom... but, y'know. You are long enough for me to do that now... figured I might as well give you a try.~ But damn... I just came, but having you like this... I'm still horny. Hope you don't mind...' Fire trails off, murmuring the last of his words as he slowly begins jerking you off once more. He starts slow, as you feel particularly sensitive under his touch after the massive orgasm he just pumped out... but he slowly starts to get going, his fingers pressing into your body and gripping you tight as he starts to thrust his hands up and down his massive length once again. He throws his head backwards on the bed, moaning out loudly enough that even people in the restaurant might be able to hear! The thought of someone coming in and seeing you in such a state... they might not be able to know it was you, but the mental image still makes you blush red - or it would if you could, of course.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     '[name of player]... mrph, damn... you don't know how much I want to just keep you right now... t-this is too much...' Fire breathlessly sighs out, pants breaking up practically every other word. He grunts, gritting his teeth together and squeezing his eyes shut, plunging the both of you into darkness. Now, you can do nothing but feel what was happening... and as his palms glide up and down, pants growing harsher and louder, you can feel that amazing, overwhelming pleasure beginning to bubble up inside you once again. Starting from your head and flowing downwards, your entire body trembles and throbs intensely, and the stallion's balls start to clench up and wobble beneath you. After a painful few moments of anticipation for you, Fire's hands clamp down, squeezing you tightly as he throws his head back, whinnying loudly and groaning out, filling the room with noise as you begin spurting out his next incredible load.";
	say "     Horse jizz hits the ceiling fan, shooting over the ceiling like fireworks and he cries out, every rope of cum pumping through you almost painfully, so soon after the last orgasm... but the pleasure was unspeakable, causing you to thrash about and throb oh-so-needily as you milked his balls dry. Somewhere, in the back of your mind, you realized how amazing a life of pleasure like this would be... nothing but orgasm after orgasm, every single one of them wracking over your entire body and turning you into nothing but a throbbing mess in Fire's lap. The thought only causes you to spurt out the last few ropes of cream even harder, the stallion's intense orgasm lingering over you for a few more moments, before waves of tiredness wash over your form.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Fire slumps backwards on the bed, panting loudly and gulping down lungfuls of air as jizz slowly drips from the ceiling onto his body and the bed around you. Seeming not to care, his hands slowly ease up on your body, grip loosening and slowly sliding down off of you, his strength having left his body after such a mind-blowing climax. One falls down into his lap, while the other remains on your underside, cupping you gently towards him as the last of your seed seeps slowly from your entrance and drips down onto his chest. 'I just... hrrf... n-need to rest a little...' he breathes out to you, his panting gradually beginning to slow as the alicorn passes out. After such an intense couple of orgasms and session of teasing, you wouldn't have blamed him even if you could... but as he falls asleep, you feel a similar weight of drowsiness hanging over you. As you also pass out, your consciousness fading, the last thing you feel is your body slowly starting to droop, your immense weight hanging down and gradually pressing down against Fire's chest as you shrink.";
	say "     ... A while later, you awaken, feeling groggy. Your eyes slowly blink open, and you look around - only to realize you were draped over Fire's body, back in your proper body, weight pressing down on top of him. The stallion slowly opens his eyes at your movements, hands moving up to find your body and hug you gently against him. The two of you lay there wordlessly for a few moments, enjoying the subtle euphoria that seems to hang over the two of you still... before you eventually shift together, rolling over in order to sit up and look around properly. The room was a mess, cum covering the floor, the ceiling, one of the walls... and the both of you, too. Fire chuckles as you survey the damage. 'Heh... phew. This'll be a lot to clean up... but it was worth it. That was incredible... Needless to say, I hope you come back and do it again. Did it feel as amazing as I hoped it would...?' He questions, to which you reply very affirmatively. Grinning sleepily at you, the stallion embraces you for just a few more moments, before helping you get up and head to the washroom with him. The two of you clean yourselves up, and you leave him to clean up the mess he made in his room. Before leaving, you give Fire one last wave and a smile, a blush faintly teasing your cheeks as you relive your time together in your head. You're sure that if you came back for more, it would be another unforgettable experience.";

	say "     Taking a seat at the bar, your eyes wander to a figure you haven't seen in the area before. Leaning up against the wall is some kind of stallion, covered from head to hoof in short red fur, with a pair of magnificent, feathery wings adorning their back. Atop their head is a singular horn, much like a unicorn's... but you don't recall hearing about unicorns that also had wings. You take the figure to be a male, from the abs showing faintly on his chest under all the fur, as well as his head in general - his snout had a square-ish shape and he had short, tousled red hair atop his head. He seemed to be merely surveying the restaurant, watching over the place like a sort of bouncer... you didn't exactly think the place needed one, but with all the monsters and infected beasts out there, perhaps it was better to be safe than sorry.";
	say "     Catching you staring, the stallion slowly began to shuffle over to where you were sitting, standing against the section of wall closest to you now. Walking towards you, you noted that he wasn't wearing a thing... His body showed off his toned chest, and you get a peek at his nether regions - a large sheath, and a couple heavy looking balls dangling beneath it. Looking you up and down quickly himself, he decides to break the silence between you. 'Hey. Haven't seen you around here before...' he says, an eyebrow raised. You quickly introduce yourself, telling him about the fact that you lived further into the city. 'Ah. Figures. I decided to get out of the city myself... too ruined for my tastes, and after what happened...' He looks down at himself, presumably talking about the transformation he's taken on. '... I wanted to find somewhere a bit more chill that I could settle down. There's a fair few decent people around here, at least, so this place isn't as dangerous as a lot of other areas. My name's Fire, by the way. Nice to meet ya.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You inquire about his interesting appearance, noting that you hadn't seen any stallions possessing both a horn AND wings around here. Fire chuckles a little and sits down on the stool next to you, taking out some water and having a swig before talking. 'Ah, yeah... I guess I'm what you'd call an alicorn now. I had a rather unpleasant run in with both a unicorn and a rather horny pegasus at the same time. I used to be a soldier, so I have a good amount of combat training, but... I mean, all the training in the world can't exactly help you when you've got one horse kicking you in the face while the other tries to mount you at the same time. Being outmatched, well... I mean, you can probably guess what happened, heh.' Fire spreads his arms out and gestures down at himself, showing off the results first hand.";
	say "     'How about you, though?' You tell Fire about the encounters you've had since this whole mess started. He listens intently, obviously enjoying having someone to properly talk to. 'Yeah... this whole thing is a mess. I wound up in this town after I retired 'cause I thought it would be pretty peaceful here, but... well, you know how it goes. Now it's just fighting and fucking in streets. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's fun... occasionally, with someone you like. But the way it is out there? Pretty awful, if you ask me...' You nod, grabbing something to drink from the bar - and one for your new friend, too. He smiles, thanking you and taking a big gulp.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Now I act as a sort of... I guess bouncer around here? The twins seem to appreciate the safety, and if people want to eat and drink here, then... well, it gives me a sense of normalcy, y'know? The world's gone to shit, but at least here we can have a gathering of sane folk and pretend like society's still functioning... mostly.' He chuckles, rubbing the back of his head and looking around the bar. At the moment, it was pretty empty, with just one or two other patrons at the bar... but presumably, it'd fill up a bit more later. 'I feel pretty tough now. Like, I already was before... but after these transformations? I could wrestle a wyvern to the ground. And don't ask me if I have.' He laughs, taking another strong gulp of his drink. 'You?

I guess there are plenty of places in the city to go check out, after all... in a way, it's sort of interesting to see all the different infections that have populated the different areas... well, I'd find it more intriguing if they weren't all hostile, at least. Still!' He gets up, having finished his beer, and he goes back to the edge of the wall, leaning against it and surveying the area once more. 'At least there's some decent people around. Hey, if you ever end up coming back here... we can chat again, if you'd like. I'd appreciate having a beer buddy in times like these...' You nod to him, getting up off of the stool yourself and telling him that you'd like to talk more to him sometime. He smiles and nods to you, and you make a mental note to give him a visit next time you found yourself in the area.";
