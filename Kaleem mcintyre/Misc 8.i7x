While not very strange a thing to see with the city the way it is the sight of the black wolf's companion, a smaller auburn wolf with a bracelet wrapped around its left front paw, nuzzling and licking at the large wolf while prancing around like mad really took the cake. The large wolf doesn't seem to mind the other's antics as he wrinkles his muzzle while letting his long tail sweep behind him playfully.";
	say "     When the smaller auburn wolf stops suddenly with its nose touching the black wolf's, you take a step back in shock as you watch the smaller lupine turn around and then present [']himself['] to the larger male. The black wolf doesn't take much time to hesitate as he sniffs the upturned tail of the smaller male and then climbs up onto the submissive wolf's backside. When the black wolf begins to thrusts into the other, the hard slaps of thighs against thighs echoing loudly in your ears, you decide that now would be a good time to leave.";

to say ResolveEvent Peace:
	say "     Jogging across the plains, you come across a large bipedal blue and white furred wolf meditating in the middle of an orangish-yellow patch of grass. From the look of the other, with his imposing physique, strong jawline, rich azure and ivory furry and yellow belt strapped around his waist, the strange wolf seems to be oddly out of place given the normal mutants that roam the plains. Not that there was anything wrong with being odd, especially given the fact that this [']is['] a crossed legged blue and white lupine you're seeing after all.";
	say "     Not having a reason to bother the other you simply continue to watch the wolf for several more minutes. When a sudden strong breeze causes the odd colored lupine's long and fluffy tail to start to sway behind him you find yourself chuckling at the peaceful smirk that draws itself up across the wolf's muzzle. When you feel that you've spent enough time watching the other you turn around and then head off in another direction to continue on your journey. Making your way about your business, you fail to note a golden pair of eyes looking at where you are going as the wolf cracks its eyelids open to track your movements.";

to say ResolveEvent Champion:

The graceful form of the large and slightly shaggy furred creature makes you look on in awe as you note the way the wolf is moving around while striking out at his own darkened form mimicking him against a nearby brick wall. With a pair of black jeans strapped onto his lower end and an open orange vest clinging around his back and shoulders, the other doesn't seem the least bit out of sorts, given the circumstances that have taken over the city.";
	say "     Not quite knowing what to think about this, you are taken by surprise when a large... mole wearing a martial arts uniform and a bandanna across its head pops up out of nowhere after stepping out of a large cloud of smoke. Beady black eyes watch the wolf, who hasn't so much as twitched an ear at the appearance of the other. Not sure what is supposed to happen next, you turn away to go about your business. You're sudden departure causes you to miss what happens next as the silver wolf turns to regard the mole and the charges for the brown furred creature with fists raised. The mole is more than ready for the challenge and ends up clashing against the silver wolf in an epic battle of claws and fists!";

You find yourself stopping as these words enter into your ears just as you pass an open store front. Peeking inside you find a large gray wolf standing on the balls of his hind feet offering up something in the way of clothing to a smaller orange and white fox. 'Come on already. It's just for today,' the wolf growls. By the tone of the other's voice you can tell that wolf is male, the same as his foxy companion. 'And besides, you'd look kinda cute with this on!' The wolf's tail is wagging a mile a minute as rumbles a murr out from his throat while looking at the sexy looking vulpine.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     'Forget it, I'm not getting into this fetish of yours, even if we both do look like furry cosplay characters.' From the small smile that is blooming across the other's muzzle you can tell that the vulpine is wavering ever so slightly in his conviction. When the wolf tries again to get his companion to wear the clothing he had held in between his paws the fox turns to wag his long plume of a tail at the other in playful indignation. That proves to be a mistake on the vulpine's part.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With the kind of agility than only an animal can possess the wolf tosses the clothes off to the side and then tackles the fox to the ground. From what you can see as you lift yourself up higher against the window the lupine wastes no time as he lifts up his friend's naked rump up, unzips the crotch of the pants he happens to be wearing and then mounts the smaller male with a rough and eager thrust of his hips. Backing away from the window you don't feel that the vulpine is in any danger as the protective embrace the wolf has his companion wrapped up in speaks of a kind of passion only lovers or best friends could muster into being. The primal howls and yips of ecstasy that the fox lets out are another sign that everything is going to be alright with the pair.";

From what you can see the weasel is smoking on something that looks like a cigarette, but from the smell that's lingering in the air you can tell that what he's trippin['] on isn't tobacco. Finding yourself getting slightly lightheaded you walk over to the others without really knowing why.";

	say "     Traversing the inner sanctum of the hospital, you come across a room with a pair of vixens wearing nurse uniforms muttering over something sitting on a table in between them. Stepping into the room to take a peek at what the vulpines happen to be surveying what you see makes your mouth drop open in surprise. You blink twice just to be sure that what you are looking at is real, but upon the vision not dissipating you realize that you are indeed looking at a young fennec boy staring up to the two females with something akin to uncertainty written across his light brown muzzle. The fact that the other is naked and is trying to shyly cross his legs so that his sheath isn't clearly on display gives you a clue about what's taking place here.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Maybe we should try something else since that didn't work?' One of the nurses questions to her companion while giggling naughtily. 'You could be right.' The other agrees while nodding her head. 'How about we get the new serum that the doctor was working on? That might help things along quite a bit.' The youth grows still at that and from what you can see the uncertainty on his face seems to be growing into a light panic. Bizarrely enough, the fennec doesn't look as though he's going to complain about the situation he's somewhat wrapped up in. When one of the nurses goes off to fetch something the fennec turns his head to watch the gray furred vulpine with suspicious eyes.";
	WaitLineBreak;

'Now hold still dearie,' the fox holding the syringe chirps. 'This will only hurt for a second.' The fennec backs up into the bed with the clear indication that he wants nothing to do with the evil pointed object. When the other nurse reaches out to hold the youth steady the sudden feeling that you should do something rises up inside of your guts. Maybe you should speak up in the youth's defense?";

And what are you doing in here?' One of the females asks and you simply say you were stopping by before smiling imploringly at the nurse. 'That's nice, but I think you need to leave...now. We're in the middle of something rather important here.' Looking between the two vulpines and then to fennec huddled up against the bed in almost an upright fetal position you politely ask the nurses what's happening with the youth there.";

After politely telling him that the person he was searching for wasn't here anymore he started to raise a fuss, so we had one of the orderlies place him into this room until a doctor could come by to speak to him. Since all of the doctors are busy at the moment we two were sent here to handle this situation.' The nurse not holding the needle replies and you look to the fennec to try and get his side of the story.
