Object	Name
An Old Tale	"An Old Tale"

An Old Tale is a situation.
The sarea of Old Tale is "High".
When play begins:

	Add Old Tale to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Old Tale:
	say "As you walk through the high rises district you come across a large black feral wolf with a cross-shaped scar across its chest sitting down and scratching at its left ear. While not very strange a thing to see with the city the way it is the sight of the black wolf's companion, a smaller auburn wolf with a bracelet wrapped around its left front paw, nuzzling and licking at the large wolf while prancing around like mad really took the cake. The large wolf doesn't seem to mind the other's antics as he wrinkles his muzzle while letting his long tail sweep behind him playfully.";
	LineBreak;
	say "When the smaller auburn wolf stops suddenly with its nose touching the black wolf's you're take a step back in shock as you watch the smaller lupine turn around and then present [']himself['] to the larger male. The black wolf doesn't take much time to hesitate as he sniffs the upturned tail of the smaller male and then climbs up onto the submissive wolf's backside. When the black wolf begins to thrusts into the other, the hard slaps of thighs against thighs echoing loudly in your ears, you decide that now would be a good time to leave.";

Section 2 - Peace

Object	Name
Peace	"Peace"

Peace is a situation.
The sarea of Peace is "Plains".

Instead of resolving a Peace:
	say "Jogging across the plains you come across a large bipedal blue and white furred wolf meditating in the middle of an orangish-yellow patch of grass. From the look of the other, with his imposing physique, strong jawline, rich azure and ivory furry and yellow belt strapped around his waist, the strange wolf seems to be oddly out of place given the normal mutants that roam the plains. Not that there was anything wrong with being odd, especially given the fact that this [']is['] a crossed legged blue and white lupine you're seeing after all.";
	LineBreak;
	say "Not having a reason to bother the other you simply continue to watch the wolf for several more minutes. When a sudden strong breeze causes the odd colored lupine's long and fluffy tail to start to sway behind him you find yourself chuckling at the peaceful smirk that draws itself up across the wolf's muzzle. When you feel that you've spent enough time watching the other you turn around and then head off in another direction to continue on your journey. Making your way about your business, you fail to note a golden pair of eyes looking at where you are going as the wolf cracks its eyelids open to track your movements.";

Object	Name
Champion	"Champion"

Champion is a situation.
The sarea of Champion is "High".

Instead of resolving a Champion:
	say "While moving on your way down the streets of the high rise you find yourself pausing as you come across a shadow boxing bipedal silver wolf. The graceful form of the large and slightly shaggy furred creature makes you look on in awe as you note the way the wolf is moving around while striking out at his own darkened form mimicking him against a nearby brick wall. With a pair of black jeans strapped onto his lower end and an open orange vest clinging around his back and shoulders the other doesn't seem the least bit out of sorts, given the circumstances that have taken over the city.";
	LineBreak;
	say "Not quite knowing what to think about this you are taken by surprise when a large...mole wearing a martial arts uniform and a bandana across its head pops up out of nowhere after stepping out of a large cloud of smoke. Beady black eyes watch the wolf, who hasn't so much as twitched an ear at the appearance of the other. Not sure what is supposed to happen next you turn away to go about your business. You're sudden departure causes you to miss what happens next as the silver wolf turns to regard the mole and the charges for the brown furred creature with fist raised. The mole is more than ready for the challenge and ends up clashing against the silver wolf in an epic battle of claws and fists!";
	increase XP of player by 10;
	say "Watching the silver wolf you think you've picked up a trick or two!";

Cosplay is a situation.
The sarea of Cosplay is "Red".
When play begins:
	Add Cosplay to badspots of furry;
	Add Cosplay to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Cosplay:
	say "'No, I am not going to wear either that jacket or that tacky red scarf. So just forget about it!' You find yourself stopping as these words enter into your ears just as you pass an open store front. Peeking inside you find a large gray wolf standing on the balls of his hind feet offering up something in the way of clothing to a smaller orange and white fox. 'Come on already. It's just for today,' the wolf growls. By the tone of the other's voice you can tell that wolf is male, the same as his foxy companion. 'And besides, you'd look kinda cute with this on!' The wolf's tail is wagging a mile a minute as rumbles a murr out from his throat while looking at the sexy looking vulpine.";
	LineBreak;
	say "'Forget it, I'm not getting into this fetish of yours, even if we both do look like furry cosplay characters.' From the small smile that is blooming across the other's muzzle you can tell that the vulpine is wavering ever so slightly in his conviction. When the wolf tries again to get his companion to wear the clothing he had held in between his paws the fox turns to wag his long plume of a tail at the other in playful indignation. That proves to be a mistake on the vulpine's part.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "With the kind of agility than only an animal can possess the wolf tosses the clothes off to the side and then tackles the fox to the ground. From what you can see as you lift yourself up higher against the window the lupine wastes no time as he lifts up his friend's naked rump up, unzips the crotch of the pants he happens to be wearing and then mounts the smaller male with a rough and eager thrust of his hips. Backing away from the window you don't feel that the vulpine is in any danger as the protective embrace the wolf has his companion wrapped up in speaks of a kind of passion only lovers or best friends could muster into being. The primal howls and yips of ecstasy that the fox lets out are another sign that everything is going to be alright with the pair.";
	increase libido of player by 5;

Fantasy is a situation.
The sarea of Fantasy is "High".
When play begins:
	Add Fantasy to badspots of furry;
	Add Fantasy to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Fantasy:
	say "When a large red wolf runs pass you on all fours with a blue furred feline, carrying a spear across its shoulder, right on its trail you can almost swear that you've seen those two somewhere before. Not really sure where you simply shrug before going about your way. That is, right before you end up coming across a massive beast of a collie standing at about twelve feet in height. The horny shemale growls happily as it looks to you and suddenly you realize what the other pair was running away from.";
	challenge "Shemale Smooth Collie";
	say "With that problem taken care of you grunt in annoyance at as you realize that video game characters must seriously have it rough if they have to deal with things like that every day.";

Controversy is a situation.

The sarea of Controversy is "High".
When play begins:
	Add Controversy to badspots of humorous;

Instead of resolving a Controversy:
	say "Walking down the street you find yourself coming across a boarded up mini mart with a fat black bear wearing a long overcoat and a skinny weasel with long dirty blonde hair draped down off the side of his head bobbing their heads in time with music playing on an old fashioned boombox in between them. From what you can see the weasel is smoking on something that looks like a cigarette, but from the smell that's lingering in the air you can tell that what he's trippin' on isn't tobacco. Finding yourself getting slightly lightheaded you walk over to the others without really knowing why.";
	LineBreak;
	say "As the weasel hands off the joint he's puffin' on to the black bear you find your head nodding in time to the music that's playing on the bulky looking jam machine. The rhythm of the music is an 80's remix and for some reason you find yourself really getting into it. 'Yo little homie, what's up?' The weasel asks all of a sudden and you can only shake your head at him. 'S'ok. Wanna hit this one time?'";
	say "     [bold type]Looking at the roach the bear is taking a hit of you wonder if you should.[roman type][line break]";

Taking it, putting it between your [facename of player] lips and sucking on it once you feel the heated smoke trail down into your [bodyname of player] lungs and then cough as you choke the foul stuff out. 'Whoa, whoa, not too fast man,' the weasel says and you get a few thumps on the back by the bear before nodding and handing him back the joint.";
		say "Thanking the guy for the hit you let the smoke fill up your lungs as best you can before sighing and then letting the buzz of the stuff flow through your mind. Hearing some laughter from the weasel you smirk at the other before deciding to make some small talk with the two. Asking them what they're doing here out by themselves seems to be the first thing that comes to mind.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "'Me and my friend here came down from Jersey to try and find some hot and immoral babes to fuck,' the weasel says simply. 'But wouldn't you know it, just when we got here this plague shit hit and all the women around here got dicks now. Man, what the fuck is up with that?' The weasel snorts before taking the roach back from the bear and puffing on it once again.";
		say "Not sure what to say you can only shrug as you look to the blonde weasel before turning to look around the area you're in. While it may be the high rise district the place you're currently hanging around at looks more like the slums.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Hanging out with the weasel and black bear for almost thirty minutes just shootin' the breeze, you find yourself leaving the duo a few minutes later as your slightly fogged brain remembers you what it was that you had come through this side of town for. 'Catch you later man!' The weasel throws up his hand to wave at you before you can leave and the bear simply nods at you. Making your way down the street you don't get far before the sounds of motorbikes fill your [facename of player] ears causing you to freeze. When you hear whooping and hollering a second later you have just enough time to duck as something whizzes over your head.";
		say "Lifting your head you find yourself surrounded by some gnarly looking bikers dudes, but from the look of them these are [if Grant is in the Hyena Hideout or HP of Grant > 0]not the normal hyenas you've come to know and slightly respect[else]friendly motorcyclists out for a pleasant ride[end if]. These guys... well they look like something that crawled out of the devil's asshole as their faces are messed up with a mixture of different mutations and their bodies are bulging with enough muscles to put a silverback gorilla to shame. When one of the bikers, who happens to currently waving a massive chain around into the air in his right hand, suddenly lets out a growl you prepare yourself for a fight.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "'Snooch to the Nooch!' Is all you hear before hell breaks loose as two dark forms drop down from the sky to wail on the bikers surrounding you. Not knowing what's going on you can only stand there in shock as you watch the weasel from before and his black bear companion tear the badass thugs new holes with some seriously impressive fights skills. The bikers find themselves quickly outmatched by the duo and end up driving off quick, fast and in a hurry with more than a few bruises for their troubles. When the last of the bikers are gone you turn to watch the pair, who don't have a scratch on them, give each other dap before turning to look at you. 'You okay?' The weasel asks and you just nod to him in astonishment.";
		say "'Man, you know this town is getting bad when assholes like those can just ride around on the street like they own the place. You may want to get to someplace safe cause me and my bro here are going back to Jersey so we ain't gonna be able to save you again if they come back.' Telling the weasel that you'll take his advice to heart you watch as the blonde mutant nods to you before hitting his ursine companion with his elbow and then nodding for him to follow up after him.";
		WaitLineBreak;

When play begins:
	Add Dr Feel Good to badspots of furry;
	Add Dr Feel Good to badspots of girl;

Instead of resolving a Dr Feel Good:
	say "Traversing through the inner sanctum of the hospital you come across a room with a pair of vixens wearing nurse uniforms muttering over something sitting on a table in between them. Stepping into the room to take a peek at what the vulpines happen to be surveying what you see makes your mouth drop open in surprise. You blink twice just to be sure that what you are looking at is real, but upon the vision not dissipating you realize that you are indeed looking at a young fennec boy staring up to the two females with something akin to uncertainty written across his light brown muzzle. The fact that the other is naked and is trying to shyly cross his legs so that his sheath isn't clearly on display gives you a clue about what's taking place here.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "'Maybe we should try something else since that didn't work?' One of the nurses questions to her companion while giggling naughtily. 'You could be right.' The other agrees while nodding her head. 'How about we get the new serum that the doctor was working on? That might help things along quite a bit.' The youth grows still at that and from what you can see the uncertainty on his face seems to be growing into a light panic. Bizarrely enough, the fennec doesn't look as though he's going to complain about the situation he's somewhat wrapped up in. When one of the nurses goes off to fetch something the fennec turns his head to watch the gray furred vulpine with suspicious eyes.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "Upon returning with a syringe in her hand the fennec's eyes nearly pop out of his head as his hazel orbs lock on to the point of the needle as though it were a missile about to impact in on him. 'Now hold still dearie,' the fox holding the syringe chirps. 'This will only hurt for a second.' The fennec backs up into the bed with the clear indication that he wants nothing to do with the evil pointed object. When the other nurse reaches out to hold the youth steady the sudden feeling that you should do something rises up inside of your guts. Maybe you should speak up in the youth's defense?";

And what are you doing in here?' One of the females asks and you simply say you were stopping by before smiling imploringly at the nurse. 'That's nice, but I think you need to leave...now. We're in the middle of something rather important here.' Looking between the two vulpines and then to fennec huddled up against the bed in almost an upright fetal position you politely ask the nurses what's happening with the youth there.";
		say "'Well nosy, this one came in here not too long ago looking for someone. After politely telling him that the person he was searching for wasn't here anymore he started to raise a fuss, so we had one of the orderlies place him into this room until a doctor could come by to speak to him. Since all of the doctors are busy at the moment we two were sent here to handle this situation.' The nurse not holding the needle replies and you look to the fennec to try and get his side of the story. When the young one looks up at you and then drops his head into his knees you can see that what the vixen had to tell you was the truth.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Asking the nurses what they are about to try and give the other you find the two of them jerking back slightly and then turning to give each other a nervous glance. Instantly you find your danger senses blaring at you in warning and when both of the nurses turn to glare at you...";

				say "'Thankyouthankyouthankyou! They were going to try to...! And...I was so scared! And then you came and saved me! And!' The constant babble goes on for about a minute and you patiently wait it out while patting the youth on the back in an effort to soothe his trepidation. When he finally gets some control of himself the fennec teen pulls back from you to give you a cheeky smile.";

I'm going back home to go wash off and then I'm going to go wait for her at her place! If she doesn't show up then...' Mildly you wonder how the other is going to [']wash off['] considering that the water for the city is off, but before you can voice you inquiry the fennec is heading over to the corner and then pulling out something.";
				say "When he comes back over to you he reveals that what he went to go retrieve was a doctor's uniform, complete with the standardized coat and white pair of pants. 'Here, you can have these. I was going to use them try and sneak around in here to look for my girlfriend, but I think that these will work out better for you.";
