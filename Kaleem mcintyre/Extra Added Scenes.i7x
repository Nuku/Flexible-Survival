Section 1 - Strange Sight

Strange Sight is a situation.
The sarea of Strange Sight is "Park";

Instead of resolving a Strange Sight:
	say "Walking through the forested area of the park you slowly get the creepy feeling that something is watching you. Mind instantly on edge you find your senses spreading out around you as you try and locate the unknown entity, and then whip your head over to a clump of bushes as you hear them rustle suddenly. Memories of the days before with seeing what happened with mutants taking the unwary and then fucking them in many different, not to mention unwanted ways makes you eager to turn tail and flee. You really don't want to be around here in case something comes out to try and bring bodily harm onto your vulnerable person, but on a deeper introspection you realize that the feeling you're getting right now isn't exactly foreboding, so much as it is just...uncomfortable.  Like someone is staring at you from across a room without saying anything, instead they're just studying you. Steeling your resolve you find your feet taking you over to the bushes before you can weigh the pros and cons of giving into your curiosity. Getting up-close to the foliage you take a few calming breaths before reaching out with a shaky hand to part the clump of leaves. Once you do though your mouth just drops to the ground at the sight before you. Standing regal on four legs with the face of a human but the body of a horse, but one with scales of multiple colors instead of fur is the most bizarre creature you have seen to date. Its entire body seems to almost shine as the other's armor-like hide covers the creature's neck on down to its chest catching the surrounding light in strange and yet mysterious ways. Up on top of the monster's, no, more like deity's head, stands an impressive white spiraling horn that has to be almost twelve inches long, if not longer. A shaggy mane of green hair spills out around the side of the beast's neck but can do nothing to hide the human face of the other staring back at you";
	say "Not knowing what to do or say as the lips of the stallion-like animal rise up to smile at you the only action you find your body taking is freezing on the stop as you blink rapidly fluttering eyelids at the creature. The strange amalgamation gives you a small nod, as though approving of you in some way, and then turns to scamper off somewhere through the park. A long and bushy tails whips behind its back just as it disappears out of sight.";

Section 2 - Wish 

Wish is a situation.
The sarea of Wish is "High";

Instead of resolving a Wish:
	say "Jogging through the area where the high rise district is located you come across and interesting sight as you find yourself looking up to stare at young black, orange and golden furred, calico cat looking mournfully up at the sky from out of an open window. Eyes seeming to be focusing on nothing, and yet everything at the same time, you find yourself captivated by the other as the feline clasps his/her hands together, clenches their eyes tight as though trying not to cry, before bowing their head. You can just make out the other's muzzle moving in a steady utterance, but from the distance between you, you can't really tell what the calico is saying. You'd guess that the other is praying, but maybe not because as soon as the feline lifts its head up you watch as the calico takes out a piece of paper from behind its back and then tears it into pieces. Reaching out to let the torn shreds float down onto the ground a stray wind sweeps them away before the white paper fragments can get half way to the concrete. Your own eyes widen in awe as you track the pieces of paper continue going overhead before they disappear completely. When you turn back to look at the Calico the other is gone and the window closed.";

	Now Wish is resolved;


Section 3 - Loving Bond

Loving Bond is a situation.
The sarea of Loving Bond is "High";

Instead of resolving a Loving Bond:
	say "The sounds of someone speaking making you slow down from your jogging as you try to look around for the speaker. You realize that this is a dumb thing to do as you could be possibly be putting yourself into danger by doing something like this, but a strange feeling wells up inside of your chest and suddenly you find yourself coming to a full stop in the middle of the empty road. Turning your head this way and that you finally have to look up as you notice two figures, a black canine of some variety and a white sandy brown vulpine of another other, two stories above you conversing with each other while music is playing the background. And though you can't hear what they are saying exactly you do note that the song they are playing seems awfully familiar for some reason. You try and ponder why though, and when it finally hits you as to what's going on your eyes light up like fireworks as everything clicks into place. The reason why the song being played is so familiar is because it is the melody that's usually played at weddings! Not sure how that could be right considering that the high rise area is nowhere near a church, you scratch at you head as you continue to stare as the two figures, both being male from what you can see because of the lack of any breasts, exchange rings with one another. Placing the small bands around each the middle fingers on each other's right hands you blush furiously when the two give each other passionate kiss, the likes of which could fog up a glass window, before the two newlyweds began to grope and fondle each other lustfully. The music in the background soon changes to something more of an erotic beat and flushing slightly you decide to hurry on about your way, especially when the black canine hefts his new mate up, bridal style, and then takes the giggling fox back into their loft apartment. Who knew that love could find a way to prosper in this mad town? Guess the saying is true that love conquers all.";

	add Challenge of the Alphas to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Challenge of the Alphas:
	say "Finding yourself coming across an Alpha Husky and Alpha Wolf circling each other you have to blink in uncertainty as you wonder what are the two males doing together in the middle of the street as they are now. That is, right before you take a cautious step back when both mutants bare their fangs at each other after drawing up their fleshy black lips. Body postures suddenly going rigid the two stop dead in their tracks while glaring bloody murder at you for intruding, as if they weren't already wishing death on the other. Uncertain of what to do in this situation, you can see the rage rolling off of both creatures making your spine lock up almost, you continue to watch as the two lay their ears flat against their heads while their tails snap directly up into the air in a sign that their battle will grow physical in a matter of moments. Fur bristling so much that both look like aggravated porcupines, you feel your heart hammer tightly into your chest as you watch the two canines bark and growl and drool down the sides of their muzzles as the loose themselves to their inner animals. If something's not done soon, you know that this will end bloodily with either one or both of the males dead since neither seem to be taking the better choice to flee rather than fight. Yet is this really any of your business? What do you care what two mutants do to one another? ...but still... (Y=Stay, N=Run)";
	if the player consents:
		say "Something inside of you makes you stay right where you are. This... this savagery can't continue. But what should you do? Getting in between one another might get you torn limb from limb. Should you pick sides? (Y=Alpha Wolf, N=Alpha Husky)";
		if player consents:
			say "After rushing to tackle the Alpha Husky for the Alpha Wolf you find that the lupine is somewhat confused about your interference between their inopportune, yet destined, brawl. Having caught the Alpha Husky off guard you manage to deal with the other in a somewhat sophisticatedly violent manner with some well place punches and kicks to the gut and then watch as it rushes off, the other Alpha hadn't been expecting the extra added help from an outsider. Breathing slowly at being able to stop the two from possibly killing one another you wipe your forehead just in time to feel the breath of the Alpha Wolf behind you come up to sniff at you rump. Freezing slightly you hope you haven't made a big mistake by aiding this shaggy furred mutt. Of course, luck seems to be with you as the big Alpha Wolf simply nods at you in a sign of respect and then trots his way off down the road, thankfully opposite of where the Alpha Wolf had gone. Watching the slightly matted fur of the lupine trail off into the distance you suddenly feel as though you've done a good thing today. Looking down at the ground, you see a small mound of food place at your feet. Tilting your head slightly to the left you wonder if the Alpha wolf left that for you. Maybe? But if that's true then just how intelligent are these so-called aberrations of nature?";

		otherwise:
			say "Looking for an opportunity you take the Alpha wolf by surprise and tackle the other to the ground. Before the disheveled lupine can so much as mutter a whine you're laying into the other with punches and kicks to the chest and torso. The Alpha Husky is somewhat confused by what in the world is going on but is soon lolling out his tongue as he watches his rival scurry away...for now. You have a little time to brush off the side of your face where the wolf managed to scrape at your face with his claws before a large figure is looming over you. Eyes snapping up to look into the Alpha Husky's slightly drooling face you wonder if you've made a mistake in coming to the other's aid. When the slightly dirty looking canine manages haul you up onto your feet by the shoulder you're not prepared to receive wet doggy kisses of affection. Sputtering and trying to not get any in your mouth you find everything coming to a sudden halt as something is pushed into your hands right before the Alpha Husky pulls away from you and then takes his leave of your presence. Blinking and then looking down you find a medkit placed firmly into your hold. It takes you a second to connect the dots but when you do you realize that the mutant must have been holding onto this in case his fight went against his favor. Maybe these creatures are much smarter than you and everyone else thinks?";

	otherwise:
		say "This is none of your business. Gathering your courage you turn and run as fast your feet can carry you, just in time to hear the two canid males howl and then fly at each other. The wet sounds of flesh and fur being ripped away will probably haunt you forever in your dreams as you can only imagine what's happening back there.";

Section 5 - Anxiety

Anxiety is a situation.
The sarea of Anxiety is "Park";

Instead of resolving Anxiety:
	say "Seeing a group of soldiers going about their way throughout the park, you find your spirits lifting some as you run over to them to ask for help. You find that this move has turned out to be a big mistake because soon the armed humans are pointing the barrels of guns at you while yelling at you to halt. Skidding to an immediate stop you find yourself somewhat confused as the uniformed men and women glare at you before turning their heads to talk to one another. The conversation that occurs in front of you has your stomach knotting with butterflies while at the same time your heart freezes inside of yourself chest as the words [italic type]contaminated[roman type] and [italic type]neutralize[roman type] keep coming up too many times between the assembled group of soldiers. Being that there are five people in total, and you are not sure that you've gained a [italic type]bullet proof[roman type] hidden ability you don't think that it would be wise to try and test your luck against them. Especially given the twitchy fingers quivering along the triggers of the assorted weaponry facing in your direction as the soldiers continue to look back and forth from you and then to each other. Deciding that maybe it's time to get lost you flip your head to the left and then gasp and wave one of your hands around frantically while shouting [italic type]monster[roman type]. Instantly the five soldiers are swinging their guns in the way you point and then start firing frantically. You're flying on fast feet before they can even realize that they've been tricked.";

	add Secrets to badspots of hermaphrodite;

Instead of resolving Secrets:
	say "While walking through the streets of the town you find yourself coming to an old public bathroom and decide to stop in to see if the water is working in here. You doubt it though, but then again you can't be sure without checking, right? Getting into the public facility, you step carefully to avoid the globs of cum, milk and urine littering the once white tiled floor and walls, you wave your hand in front of your face to dispel the smell punching you into the face as you make your way to the women's side of the restrooms since you already know the guys side is probably a biohazard zone by now. Right before you head to the sinks, which are amazingly free from any kind of stains, you freeze in place as an all too familiar noise reaches your ears. Hearing stretching out wide just to be sure that you are not hearing things you find that the sounds of moaning and thumping are resounding from off of the walls of the public washroom and instantly you want to get out of here before trouble finds you. However, before you can beat a retreat one of the bathroom stalls pops open, the banging you had heard was coming from the cheap tin frame and not the far wall, and quickly two half dressed soldiers pop out and onto the ground. Both are still united as the larger of the pair, both of whom are indeed female, slaps her hands onto the floor to keep her bigger bulk from crushing her fuck buddy. You find it odd that two women could be making so much noise in the small enclosed space, all things considered, but rapidly your confusion is lifted in face of understanding as you turn your head to the side to see a large feline shaft connecting the two women together. It would seem that the larger valkyrie has been tainted by this unclean world.";
	say "You don't say anything as the blonde haired tigress-in-the-making quietly whispers to her fallen company, her eyes hastily checking over the other to make sure that the smaller brunette is alright. The pig tailed and bespectacled amazon underneath her can only shyly smile and then nod before reaching up to wrap her delicate hands around her would-be mate's neck. While only the blonde seems to have had any changes done to get genital area you take note of the dark stripes slowly growing onto the brunette's face, especially when the bigger woman starts thrusting into the smaller female's slightly weeping puss. Muscles seem to be forming on the valkyrie's chest and torso though as you watch six heavy set breast rise much more fully onto the blonde's already tight chest. Below the smaller brunette is slimming down and becoming somewhat more demure than she already is compared to her bigger lover as the glass wearing female shivers and shudders while arching back in pure rapture. The sloppy squelches of the tiger cock between them hammering into the smaller woman has you biting at your lower lip while reaching down to rub at your aching groin. The pay no attention to you, despite being three feet way as the two moan and growl together, their infection probably spreading on a deeper level internally before going to attack the outside of their beings. You can't help but feel that you have little right to impart yourself on this shared moment between the two lovers once you see the lust and love they have for each other shimmering inside of their respective green and brown colored eyes. Deciding not to bother them you hastily back away from the pair and then turn to haul ass out of the public bathroom, but not without shutting the door to the ladies room closed first. Idly you wonder if maybe some actual good has come from this entire fiasco with the out of control nanomachine, just in time to as a thunderous feline roar shakes the very foundations of the building your standing in. Definitely, it's time to go now.";
