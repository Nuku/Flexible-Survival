Section 1 - Old BoomBox

Old Record Store is a situation.
The sarea of Old Record Store is "Outside".

Instead of Resolving a Old Record Store:
	say "     Walking along and scouting for danger around every other turn, you find your steps taking you to someplace that you aren't particularly familiar with. Surprised by the fact that your body has suddenly gained an awareness all its own, you don't think to stop yourself as you follow an unseen path to an old music store that looks as though it has seen much, much better days. Even before the so-called apocalypse, you don't actually remember having seen a music shop in the neighborhood where you lived, not even in the big city really.";
	say "     After ipods, cell phones and the likes started to come out and the internet became a hospice for people pirating bootleg music via unsecure web links, music stores like this one had become a relic of a past no one remembered or cared about.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A queer smile slips across your [facename of player] face as you make your way over to the window of the shop. Trying to peek to the best of your ability, you can't really get a good look of what's inside of the building, despite having restored power to the city. Grunting and then shrugging, you prepare to turn away from the music store when you hear the telltale -click- of the front door being opened. Hastily, you crouch down to get on your guard and wonder if this is about to turn into some kind of devious mutant trick.";
	say "     When nothing happens after several seconds, you feel your nerves start to calm and your muscles unclench as a sense of safety washes over you. Not knowing what's going on here, you find yourself wondering if you should take a chance and go into the darkened storefront.";
	say "     [bold type]Should you go in?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yes.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - No.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     'Nothing ventured, nothing gained', someone once told you, and you can't help but think that said person might have been right for once. Taking a deep breath to draw up some confidence, you make your way over to the opened door, pull the barrier open, and then take a few timid steps inside. You instantly find yourself swarmed with the sounds of a weird style of music playing -- a strange mix of bluegrass and acid jazz that somehow seems to work -- as well as whispered words from unseen people having some sort of important discussion. At least you would guess the argument is significant by the tone of the utterances.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Eyes swiftly tracking the area of the store from left to right and then up to down, you find yourself growing very confused when you don't actually see anybody. The lights are flicking on above you, illuminating the surrounding area, yet this is kinda confusing since it didn't look like this was so from the outside. A trick of the light perhaps?";
		say "     Despite this, however, the whispers seem to grow somewhat quieter around you, as if your presence has become an inquiry to those unseen. Not believing in ghosts, since no such things could possibly exist, you wonder if this is some kind of strange mutant ploy. That's when the screech of a record needle scratching across a vinyl surface causes you to hiss in pain.";
		say "     Grunting in annoyance, you shake your head, wanting desperately to forget that noise ever happened, before you see a flicker from the back room that draws your attention. Not knowing what to do, you find yourself at the crossroads of yet another decision.";
		say "     [bold type]Should you go in or should you turn tail and flee?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Go in.";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Turn tail and flee.";
		if player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     Deciding to bite the bullet just one more time, you go for the backroom to check to see if someone is in there. There's no way this place can be totally empty; that would defy the most basic form of logic there is -- cause and effect -- as somebody had to have opened the front door to the store for you to get in here. Marching forward, with your shoulders pushed out in front of you and your chest puffed up like a preening bird, you convince yourself that you're going to straighten out whatever practical joker is trying to be funny with you! What you find when you shoulder the door to the backroom open is... nothing.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Well not exactly nothing, per say. Taking a look around the room, your eyes see that the surrounding area is littered with albums and CD's and... lo and behold... tapes! You don't think you've actually seen a cassette tape in the last five or ten years! Your eyes nearly bulge out of your head as you realize the treasure trove that you've stumbled upon. Whoever has left this place unattended is really doing himself a disservice as s/he's got so much to steal in here that it barely makes any sense.";
			say "     Shutting the door behind you and then walking around in awe, your mind slowly begins to ramble through your somewhat foggy memories as you try and recall all of the hit artists that are collected here in this place. Most have long since faded from stardom, but more than a few continue to shine brightly, even in the dimly lit room with the fifty watt bulb flickering on above you.";
			say "     The whispers, which you can still hear, despite them being somewhat muffled by the closed door, slowly grow louder as you place your fingers over and across the casings of many of the cassettes. Not really sure why you do it, you find your fingers tracing over two cassettes out of the hundreds present. Both tapes bear the vocals of a particular male and female artist, respectively, that you remembered being enamored with a long time ago.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Taking the tapes and then flipping them around onto the back to read the songs, just to see if you remember them all correctly, your eyes jump when you hear a radio come on all of a sudden. It is putting out what you can tell should be the local news, but you know there's been no radio broadcasts since this whole madness started. The weather and time seem accurate, making you scan around the room to again search for whoever is behind all this. Casting your sights around to see where the voice is coming from, you find your gaze narrowing down to a small table hidden from view off into the left corner of the room.";
			say "     Again, you find yourself confused as you wonder what the hell is going on here. First the spooky shop with the self opening door, the whispers, the music and now the news. Had you not known any better you could almost swear that someone is trying to get your attention. Laughter bubbles up out of your throat as you find the hilarity of the situation too much to stand. The slight crackle of fear and insanity coloring your hilarity must be in your head, you reason, as you are NOT afraid right now. Nope. No sir. Calming your laughs down into giggles and then into quiet chuckles, you pull yourself over the table to have a look-see at what's making all the ruckus.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     What you find is an old boombox staring up at you, almost as if in longing for your presence. The old fashioned machine is big and clunky, though nothing compared to your bedroll, with switches and knobs and the likes which signal its age. However, you do happen to note that the thing has a CD player attached to the top of it, so the machine can't be all that old. You shake your head as you turn away from the music maker, but soon you have to look back as you could have just sworn that you heard your name coming from the thing.";
			say "     Listening very hard, you almost have to strain to hear anything as the volume on the old boombox quickly silences itself. Pulling back to tilt your head in befuddlement, a scowl soon covers your [facename of player] face as you promise that you're going to make whoever is pulling this joke off on you pay when you find them. Whirling away from the jam machine, you head back over to the other side of the room to replace the cassettes that you have in hand. Just as you are about to set the twin tapes back, the boombox suddenly pumps up the volume loud enough that you nearly jump up onto the ceiling.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Gritting your teeth, once you come back down to earth, you figure that enough is enough! Walking over to the old boombox and then snatching the machine up, you switch it off and stomp your way out into the front and then shout for someone... ANYONE... to come out and get this little joke over with. Silence answers you. Not even the whispers from before can be heard as you look around desperately for a store clerk, manager or somebody to come and tell you what's going on.";
			say "     No one ever does.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Not knowing what's going on, but not liking this craziness anymore, you decide to split while the getting's good. Rushing out of the front door, the old boombox in hand, you make your way down the street and back to the bunker at top speeds. Behind you, the door to the music shops quietly shuts and then locks itself, but only after the figure of an old man walks by the window. Obviously, you've just been become the butt of someone's elaborate prank... right?";

		else:
			LineBreak;
			say "     You get the creeps from this place and decide to go back home, or to the bunker at least. The whispers around you seem somewhat saddened by your departure and the music playing in the background slows down until it finally falls silent. You don't notice any of this as you're out the door and down the street before the local mutants can spot your dust trail. Not that you're scared of course. Behind you the door to the music shop closes with an audible click.";
			now Old Record Store is resolved;
	else:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Deciding to err on the side of caution, you spin on your heel and then march straightaway from the creepy music store. And though you don't notice it during your posthaste retreat, another -click- resounds throughout the air, the building's door having shut tight once again.";

Section 4 - Playing Music

Boombox is a object.
It is fixed in place.

The description of BoomBox is "An old jam machine that looks as though it had once been something very popular. Strangely enough, and despite the age of the machine, there is little wear and tear on the outside covering of the device. Perhaps whoever owned it kept the machine in a secure place so as to make sure that it wouldn't get damaged? Even more strange, the music player works... without power. Maybe if you pressed [bold type]play[roman type] the machine might start to work?".

instead of sniffing BoomBox:
	say "     The faint scent of good old times seem to waft around the old jam machine. Memories of days gone by, some of them before your time, flitter through your head as you sniff the machine in question. For some reason though, that doesn't bother you much.";

	if BoomBox is not in the bunker, say "     You have nothing to play." instead;

Not really sure how to feel about this, you find yourself swaying with the notes as the instruments slowly work in concert to energize the bunker.[line break]   The feeling that you want to suddenly start dancing around passionately has you nearly shivering when the music takes on a sudden lively flare.

Going to sit down on one of the cots in the room, you let your head bob in time with the instruments, and you can almost hear someone singing in time with the melody.

Amazing what old music can do to someone. This would be a good time for you to go out and find some music, preferably with a male singer, for you (the player) likes to listen to as well.
