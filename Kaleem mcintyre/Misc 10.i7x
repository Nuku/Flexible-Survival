It's the sound of the other's voice that makes you stop dead in your tracks more than what the other just said. Having not become used to being addressed so casually you stop dead in your tracks and then turn to have a look over at the...[italic type]man[roman type], at least you think it's a man from the sound of the other's voice, standing in front of an overturned Cadillac. Some unfamiliar instinct has you lowering your guard as you step closer to the unknown person, who oddly enough seems quite human given his very [italic type]normal[roman type] looking gait.";

	say "     'Say, you look like the kinda persona that could use a little [italic type]somethin' somethin'[roman type] to help perk [if Player is male]him[else]them[end if] up. So why not try this?' The man calmly fishes through a backpack sitting on the ground next to him and then hands something over to you. Hesitantly you stretch out your hand out and then watch as the stranger drops three small capsules into your hand. Looking over them, you immediately wonder if you've just been given a narcotic, but before you can ask the question the other the mysterious stranger is chuckling and shaking his head at you.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Don't worry. It's not dope or anything like that - though something stronger than a gin and tonic might be a necessity in these strange times. Let's just call these little joys...[italic type]stamina boosters[roman type] and leave it like that.' The man chuckles at you from underneath the shade of the black detective hat that he has draped onto his head before picking up his pack and then slinging it over his shoulder. 'Be seeing you around.' And with that the other is gone. Not sure you blink as you watch the other go off about his way before shaking your head as you realize just where you are at the moment.";

A second or two later the pain subsides and you shake your head before getting back up onto your feet. Berating yourself for taking an unknown substance from an unknown person you pause and then blink before noting that you feel rather...odd...all of a sudden. Could the capsule have really increased your stamina or is this some kind of placebo affect?";

to say ResolveEvent Air Drop:

Not sure what this is all about, but curious anyway you head off into the direction the helicopter is going. It takes you some time but eventually you end up trailing the helicopter all the way to a seemingly abandoned junkyard.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     When the hook the container is attached to the hook is suddenly unclasped, probably by means of remote, you watch as the crate sails down and then crashes onto a cleared out area on the ground. Looking back up and watching as the whirlybird heads off in the direction it just came from you hear the screech of a flock of wyvern just before seeing several flying reptiles honing in on the helicopter. When the sounds of gunfire begin to assault the air you whimsically shake your head before heading over to have a look at what exactly the whirlybird just dropped off.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Upon getting to the container you find yourself flipping open the latch holding the doors of the crate closed on a whim and then gasp in awe as you find yourself looking at a plethora of food and water stacked to the brim before you. As your mind goes to wondering about the who, how and why of the situation you find the sounds of people racing into your general position teasing across the end of your field of hearing. Not wanting to be caught by people who probably wouldn't be too thrilled to see you looting their obvious provision you quickly grab what you can and then haul ass before the others can arrive.";

Not sure what's this on about, but hoping you're not about to be bothered by any weirdo mutants, you blink as you look down to find a...small wand-like object winking up on the ground in front of you. The fact that said object has a small piece of paper tied to it only serves to make increase your confusion as you kneel down to pick up the wand thing.";

	say "     Looking up at the sky in question, as if hoping someone will explain where this thing had just come from, you find yourself gazing up at the [if daytimer is day]azure sky[else]starry skies above[end if] unsurely before shrugging helplessly. Checking out the wand and then looking at the piece of paper tied to it you blink in confusion as the scrawl written down reads 'Sailor Star Power!'. The faintest memory of a TV show you had once seen before about magical girls pops through your head like a flash and silently you wonder if this is some kind of joke. Then again, given everything that happened in this town already you wonder if...";

Lifting the wand up and then shouting 'Sailor Star Power' you find yourself immediately regretting your action when a burst of rainbow colored light swallows you up. A sudden bout of confusion overcomes you as you first feel a wave crash over your body, followed by a feeling of nakedness and then finally something like ribbons strapping themselves all across your form before quickly everything slows down and you finally can blink open your eyes to see the world again. What you find however, turns out to be rather... extraordinary as you look down over yourself.";

You'd scream, but you're somewhat afraid of what may come out of the shadows to have a look at what the noise is all about so instead you shakily look for your backpack, which had mysteriously slipped from your shoulders during your transformation, grab said pack when you do find it and then hurry back to the bunker so you can make sense of all of this.";
		say "     As you run off, you never notice a black cat sitting on the ground watching you as you scamper away in fear. And maybe that's a good thing, because at seeing the casual smirk lining the feline's facial features, your fading resolve might have completely crumbled and you might have had that nervous breakdown after all.";

You blink twice to be sure, but yes, you are seeing a naked half-female, half-fish woman, sitting along one of the lower docks and talking to a young otter. The two seem to be chuckling over something, but you can't hear the conversation from where you are. Taking the time to watch the two of them you look to see the mermaid, with her long cerulean hair and ample bosom, as she leans over next to the otter, who is quite male from what your eyes can tell you of the other's gender, and then goes to town nuzzling the other somewhat fondly. It's only the sudden shout of someone calling out for someone else that breaks up this tender little moment.";
	say "     You watch as the otter shakes his head before pulling himself up and away from the mermaid somewhat sorrowfully. You continue to gaze at this sadly romantic scene even as the mermaid nods her head at the mustelid in understanding before diving into the ocean to go off about her way. The otter turns just in time to see a killer whale in a pair of cut-off blue jeans run up to him. The next few seconds are filled with strife between the two water mammals as they argue with each other, but at this point your attention wanes and you go off about your way.";

Moving further towards the edge of the docks, you wonder if what you are seeing is a naturally born whale or something else; however, upon noting that the dark shadow seems too long to be a whale and too big to be a squid, you find yourself mystified by what you are seeing. When the shadow suddenly moves away about a minute later, you figure that whatever you are seeing it isn't hostile, so there's no sense in contemplating on it further since it doesn't seem to want to make itself known.";
	say "     Shrugging, you continue to make your way down the docks to go off to do what you were here to do in the first place while putting the odd occurrence out of your mind. However, had you looked back to check one more time, you would have noticed a pair of faintly glowing yellow eyes radiating from inside of the sea following the path you are taking.";

Turning you search for the area in which the voice had come from you look to find a black furred otter holding up a fish in one of her webbed hands. Thinking that maybe having a little extra variety in today's meal might be good for your stomach you head over to the otter to ask how much. 'There's no charge dear. I'm giving away what I have to those who don't have much. So here,' the otter hands you two fish, 'take these and take care of yourself.' Nodding to the kind mustelid, you smile as you think about how nice some people can be, despite the craziness going on in the city.";

'Hey, you know how these Zephyr corp people keep coming around and advertising their company all over the city, especially down here at the docks?' a middle aged orca quietly asks his companions, a brown otter and a three headed bipedal hydra. 'Yeah, so what?' the otter asks, unimpressed. 'Well, rumor has it that they were in business long before the epidemic hit this side of the states,' the orca mutters somewhat quietly. 'Where'd you hear such a thing from?' the hydra's three heads ask all at the same time. 'From my cousin down south. She told me that they had these weird people come around and set up an office in the area where she is staying right before a serious of strange events started to take place down there.'";
	say "     'Strange like what?' the otter asks. 'Well, things like a rash of animal attacks, people going missing, and people reporting seeing strangers moving other's stuff out of their houses in the dead of night,' the orca mutters.

The rules are simply: whoever can show off the best moves while diving gets to put their group's mark on a board at the front of the pier for this week and be named Diving Champs. This sets the respective groups on fire and soon the contest to see who can dive the best gets quickly under way. You don't stay to watch the show, but you do notice how everyone seems to be getting along better now since they have a way to exert some of their pent up aggressions with one another. Maybe this will be a key to helping to figure things out for later, you think before moving on.";
