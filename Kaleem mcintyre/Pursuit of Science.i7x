Just imagine it - and entire group of wolves, lions and the like all marching together against a greater number of humans.'

Trying to understand what this is all about you get the oddest sense that you may not see Omio again after the city is rescued...or sanitized. However, that can't be right. The other just asked you to come by and help her out sometime later on. Maybe you're just feeling lonesome since you'll probably not have a reason to see the other quite so often.

Twisting your head around to make sure that you're not dreaming you find that - yep - [if Omiotalk is 1]Omio[else]the strange woman is gone[end if] and the other are gone. Weird.";

Making as much noise as possible to alert her to your presence you almost leap out of your [skin of player] when sharp golden eyes turn to regard you. At seeing that it's just you Omio lets her face until a friendly mask is placed over the redhead's formerly irritated features. 'Oh hey, I was just thinking about you!' With that look on her face you wonder if you should start running about now. When the redhead gets up to stretch you note all of hidden muscles she possesses in her arms as the sleeves of her blue Chinese styled dress slip down her bicep.";

You try to ask the other what she needs, but sadly it gets muffled into the redhead's warm and slightly comfy feeling bosom. When Omio decides to let you go, some minutes later, you pant slightly as your [facename of player] face is somewhat very sweaty. Despite her size the redhead is both very strong and has a very high body temperature. Odd. 'If you have some time I need you to do me a big favor.'";

'Well I need to examine a unicorn, but at the moment I don't want to be bothered with the only one in town because of [']circumstances['] beyond my control.' Omio scowls slightly and covers her chest with both of her arms and you get the feeling that something big must be up to make the normally bubbly redhead so upset. 'Any who, because of this I would like for you to become a unicorn and then come back here so I can examine you.' At this you blink at Omio - the redhead is smiling at you sincerely - and then ask her if she's lost her mind. When the other begins to giggle at you, you realize that she has indeed lost her marbles.";

Don't worry I know where you can find one to borrow some [']genetic material['] from.' Omio wags her eyes at you lewdly and then tells you about the Palomino where a unicorn barkeeper works. 'I'm sure he'd be very happy to help you out with becoming a unicorn, especially if you were to help him with a problem or two.'

Omio hums thoughtfully as she says this, her face tight with contemplation.";

Grunting from the feel of the woman's strong grip you wonder if the other is some kind of behemoth-type mutant in disguise as you feel your ribs starting to creak slightly[if facename of player is bodyname of player]. Whinnying for the other to let you go you all but collapse as you suck in grateful gulps of air when the redhead suddenly releases you[else].

'Now that you've acquired all of the genetic material needed with your transformation please sit down on the table over there.'";
		say "Nodding in somewhat disbelief at the sudden change of the other, you do as you're told without further ado. Maybe she really does have some kind of personality disorder? A slight shudder goes through you as you speculate over just exactly what the redhead is going to do to you. You are not prepared for a bright white light to flare up out of nowhere, only to disappear a moment later, momentarily blinding you. When next you can see you look to find Omio with a face mask strapped around her tanned nose and chin, a pair of white latex gloves on, a nurse's scrub covering her blue Chinese dress, while carrying an old fashion black leather doctor's bag that look like it had slipped through a time hole from the 1960s.";
		WaitLineBreak;

'I'm going to need you to get out of these and then prepare for some advance medical testing, the likes of which is not standardized by any health organization in America.' The chuckle that seeps free from the redhead makes the hairs along the back of your spine lift up in pure and unadulterated fright. Maybe if you run now you could try and get away? Probably not with the way Omio is looking at you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "You try and say something but all you can do is goldfish as the redhead continues to try and loosen you from your only decent set of clothing. Sadly enough, you find the thought of being naked in front of Omio somewhat arousing and soon you are helping the golden eyed female to strip you down[if player is male] Making sure to rub suggestively along your groin when Omio unzip your pants you find that Omio barely even blinks when your [cock of player] cock slips free from your confining leg wear[else]. Rubbing against the cleft of your tight puss when you shakily unfasten the ties of your pants you wonder if Omio ever gets embarrassed by these sorts of things[end if]. Once you are fully naked Omio then proceeds to go about checking your blood pressure, examining both of your eyes and ears, measuring your arms, legs, chest and then [if facename of player is bodyname of player]shaving away bits of your glimmering horn to place the snippets into a small Petri dish[else]nods her head at you somewhat briskly[end if] before pulling out some other medical tools.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Drawing blood and saliva from you next and then storing the fluids into small test tubes Omio goes about asking you several questions while at the same time giving you no speculations as to her own thoughts. Some of the questions are a bit...invasive...but you don't have much of a problem answering Omio because of the strangely disarming nature in which the redhead asks them. Once that is done the redhead stands up and then looks you over completely. A playful light shimmers inside of Omio's golden eyes as she looks at your crotch.";

Omio's fake Texan accent has you stammering slightly in disquietude, however, before you can do much of anything the other has her hands on your [cock of player] cock and is stroking it to full hardness. One would think that with latex gloves on the feeling of the redhead stroking you would be uncomfortable, but that proves not to be so, especially as your precum starts to ooze from the tip of your slit on down over the length of your manhood. Grunting as you slowly start to thrust your hips up into the female's hand you can't help but groan as your eyes flutter close while your back arches from the exquisite hand job your getting.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "You grip the sides of the couch with your meaty fingers when Omio brings up her other hand to begin twisting your cock with strong, but easy, pumps. Trying to hold onto your orgasm as you feel your balls quickly start to twitch between your legs you pant through clenched teeth while bucking almost frantically up into Omio's talented hands. It's sadly, or rather wonderfully, a losing battle for you as Omio seems to know exactly what she's doing. Stroking down the thick pulsing veins on your organ the redhead quickly proceeds to finish you off quickly when she moves one of her hands down to tease at your balls. A playful chuckle from Omio echoes in your twitching ears as the red continues to milk you in an effort to get out your churning load of cum -- her hands are now moving in a rapid paced motion up and down your cock almost becoming a white blur to you.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "Grunting and then shouting your ecstasy to the world you fire your cum up out of your cock with almost rocket-like force, which consequently makes the gleaming trails of frothy ooze spray up over your head before slowly coming to rain down onto your face, chin and neck. Blinded by the stars popping across your vision soon after you never notice how the redhead backs away from you and then pulls out a large jar to collect your spurting cum up off of your lap. All you notice is blissful darkness as you pass clean out from the exertion of such a breathtaking orgasm.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "When you wake up from your inopportune nap you have a hard time remembering what exactly happened, that is, until you find your clothes still in a puddle on the ground and your lap sticky with dried cum. Blushing slightly as the memories return to you, you look around to see where Omio has gotten to. When you see nothing and no one, save some skunk girls grinning at you from behind a bush you decide that Omio must have used her teleporter to go back home. Either that or walked. Picking up your clothes you note that there are several provisions laid out on the ground for you.";
			else:
				say "'Alright then, just hold still while I conclude the last portion of the examination.' Omio chuckles and quickly you find yourself trying to back away from the other. You fearful retreat only succeeds in causing you to slip further onto the table, which consequently gives Omio a perfect opening as a white gloved hand reaches down to dip two fingers into your open cunt. A sudden grunt of pleasure quickly turns into panting moans as you feel Omio's, surprisingly thick digits, slip deeper and deeper into you until the redhead has both of her knuckles buried inside of your [bodyname of player] pussy. Spreading your legs on instinct you buck and shiver as the wannabe doctor's swirls her fingers around inside of your cunt while pressing her thumb over the nub of your clit. Arching and panting your body feels like you're about to go into heat as your honey begins to leak out from the inside of your now gaping folds.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "Seeing you in such an intriguing position, Omio snickers and then brings the rest of her fingers together to bury all five of her digits into your oozing pussy. Feeling those sinful fingers pressing down deeper into you, you can't help but to throw back your head and then shout out a strong cry of bliss when your fleshy lips flutter and then lock up vice tight around Omio's roving fingers. Holding the redhead's hand down tight you buck and then groan as gouts of blue nectar dribble out of you and onto Omio's gloved hand as you climax powerfully.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "When you come down from off of your high you drop back onto the table and then begin to pant like an overworked freight train. Mind whirling as though you've gone through an unbelievable experience, which technically you have, you blink your eyes open and then look down just in time to see Omio collecting your colorful nectar into a large jar. When the redhead speaks next you can only twitch an eye as Omio's words sink deep into your brain. 'Thanks a lot for this sample! I never would have gotten old Harold to give me anything unless I raised my ass for him. But thankfully I didn't have to do that because you did instead!' The redhead holds up the now capped jar and then pulls out a sharpie to label it. 'With this we can test some new theories to see if unicorn cum actually does extend one's life! Maybe if you feel like it you can work we me and my company later on to see if this is true or not?'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "You pass out from exhaustion before you can comment on that one and when you wake up you have a hard time remembering what exactly happened, that is, until you find your clothes still in a puddle around you on the floor and your lap sticky with your spilled honey. Blushing slightly as the memories return to you, you quickly get up and then go about your way before any trouble can find you. In your backpack are several extra supplies that had been given over by Omio.";

The look in her eye is a bit forlorn, but at the same time you don't think you're ready for her to try anything more on your. 'Ok, well, I'm going to be working back at home. If you want to come and help me out again just head there.' Omio winks at you and then moves to take of her gloves and scrubs.";
