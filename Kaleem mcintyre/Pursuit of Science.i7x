Rubbing against the cleft of your tight puss when you shakily unfasten the ties of your pants you wonder if Omio ever gets embarrassed by these sorts of things[end if]. Once you are fully naked Omio then proceeds to go about checking your blood pressure, examining both of your eyes and ears, measuring your arms, legs, chest [if facename of player is bodyname of player] and then shaving away bits of your glimmering horn to place the snippets into a small Petri dish[otherwise]and then nods her head at you somewhat briskly[end if] before pulling out some other medical tools.[line break]";

One would think that with latex gloves on the feeling of the redhead stroking you would be uncomfortable, but that proves not to be so, especially as your precum starts to ooze from the tip of your slit on down over the length of your manhood. Grunting as you slowly start to thrust your hips up into the female's hand you can't help but groan as your eyes flutter close while your back arches from the exquisite hand job your getting.[line break]";

Trying to hold onto your orgasm as you feel your balls quickly start to twitch between your legs you pant through clenched teeth while bucking almost frantically up into Omio's talented hands. It's sadly, or rather wonderfully, a losing battle for you as Omio seems to know exactly what she's doing. Stroking down the thick pulsing veins on your organ the redhead quickly proceeds to finish you off quickly when she moves one of her hands down to tease at your balls. A playful chuckle from Omio echoes in your twitching ears as the red continues to milk you in an effort to get out your churning load of cum -- her hands are now moving in a rapid paced motion up and down your cock almost becoming a white blur to you.[line break]";

Blushing slightly as the memories return to you, you look around to see where Omio has gotten to. When you see nothing and no one, save some skunk girls grinning at you from behind a bush you decide that Omio must have used her teleporter to go back home. Either that or walked. Picking up your clothes you note that there are several provisions laid out on the ground for you, but upon doing so you find a scraweled note slipping free from one of your pockets.

A sudden grunt of pleasure quickly turns into panting moans as you feel Omio's, surprisingly thick digits, slip deeper and deeper into you until the redhead has both of her knuckles buried inside of your [bodyname of player] pussy. Spreading your legs on instinct you buck and shiver as the wannabe doctor's swirls her fingers around inside of your cunt while pressing her thumb over the nub of your clit.

Mind whirling as though you've gone through an unbelievable experience, which technically you have, you blink your eyes open and then look down just in time to see Omio collecting your colorful nectar into a large jar. When the redhead speaks next you can only twitch an eye as Omio's words sink deep into your brain. 'Thanks a lot for this sample! I never would have gotten old Harold to give me anything unless I raised my ass for him. But thankfully I didn't have to do that because you did instead!' The redhead holds up the now capped jar and then pulls out a sharpie to label it. 'With this we can test some new theories to see if unicorn cum actually does extend one's life! Maybe if you feel like it you can work we me and my company later on to see if this is true or not?'[line break]";

[italic type]Thank you so much for this, because of you I can now create the thing that I was trying to craft earlier.[roman type] Asking her what she is planning to do with the fur and wool you collected you find yourself gasping in pain when your mind's eye suddenly explodes with the sight of Omio, in her home way out on the plains, standing over her fireplace and stirring something.

When a red vial suddenly floats over to the redhead your mouth is about ready to drop.

Within minutes of stirring the mixture you find yourself chuckles as Omio lets out a beautifully annoying chirp as she looks over the fur and wool flowing together to become one large mass. Returning to looking at the mixture you find your jaw almost hitting the floor when you see Omio pull out a large mass of...[']spotted cotton[']?[line break]";
			say "[italic type]Finally! This is proof that we can synthesize new fabrics and other substances from the infected hides and pelts of other mutants.[italic type] Omio says matter-of-factly. Quietly you ask the other why she needed to obtain this information. [italic type]Because by the time the situation here in the city is resolved, or at least contained, I don't think that there will be many natural based resources available on earth that the average person will be able to keep covering their bodies without becoming infected.[roman type] Omio seems to grow solemn at this.[line break]"; 
			say "[italic type]Think about it, you got this material from an infected sheep, now imagine what would happen if/when a farmer that supplies cotton to a large industry lets his herd become tainted without his knowledge. Baring the fact that the new mutates will probably let the farmer in on the secret once they screw him/her while the other's not looking to make them join the herd, what do you think will happen if a if steps aren't taken to check over a shipment of infected cotton in order to neutralize the virus?[roman type][line break]";
			say "Omio moves on before you can think to form up a coherent thought to the problem. [italic type]That's hundreds to thousands of pounds of cotton that could have a ram/ewe viral strains on them. If that gets out to a country that's not fully vaccinated then that's thousands to maybe even millions of people that could end up growing sheepskin and hooves before anyone knows what has happened. There's no way that that can be allowed to happen.[roman type] Omio pauses before continuing her lecture. [italic type]You have to realize that the clothes you wear absorb both sweat and skin cells whenever you put them, so looking at it from that position you can say that you are basically re-infecting yourself again and again every time you take something off and put it back. It's just that, usually, a certain strain of the virus is so strong in one person/creature that unless you have gained the ability to withstand infections you're constantly being physically changed on a molecular level as you go about your day.[roman type][line break]";
			say "[italic type]However, with the city in the state that it is in not too many people are really running around in clothes right at the moment, save for the military and maybe a few select others. Unless portable microwave units, or something close enough to it, become standard everyday tools then any contact with something infected, even if it washed, will have the possibility of transforming an untreated person into one of the infected. So, imagine if you will, millions of people possibly not being vaccinated in the future -- for one reason or another. That opens up the possibility of new strains of viruses being born right underneath the noses of the various governments of the world.[roman type][line break]";

[italic type]Once, though it was only supposed to be a test, just a harmless test.[roman type] The redhead answer quietly. [italic type]An experiment was run on a small group to see how they would handle the introduction of a new strain of genetic code into their own primitive bodies.[roman type] Omio chuckles all of a sudden. [italic type]I suppose you could say that things turned out well since the mutations that were born were everything that we could have hoped for, however, the fact that the test subjects all ended up with tails, claws, fangs, and the instincts of predators didn't help them to flourish in their own world after the changes became...permanent.[roman type][line break]";

Just like before, in a flash of light, the flotsam club is taken off of your hands leaving you to hold air in its place. Feeling slightly vulnerable without your weapon you ask Omio what she's going to do with it. Your answer comes as your mind is taken from where you are on the beach back to Omio's studio. Trying to keep your cool at feeling your stomach twisting and your head slowly starting to pound you blink your mind's eye once and then look to see Omio holding your club.[line break]";

[italic type]Just as I thought,[roman type] Omio mutters secretly making your head turn towards the researcher as a question blooms inside of your head. A smile peels across the redhead's tanned lips just as a dubious look crosses yours. Asking the other woman what she means by her last statement Omio hushes you as she intently focuses on the pot in front of her. [italic type]Don't interrupt me. I'm in the process of making science happen![roman type][line break]";
			say "Not knowing what to say to that you simply hover in your current disembodied form as Omio goes about trying to do this and that with the newly made soup that had once been your former weapon. It takes maybe an hour, or maybe less, time seems to be really out of order when one doesn't have a physical body to count the seconds off with, for anything exciting to happen, but what does happen next astounds you.[line break]";
			say "While she had been stirring the contents of her pot Omio had been systematically pouring in chemicals and reagents into the mix. From what you could see it would appear that the redhead had just been mixing and matching things at will, and by some of the looks that crossed her face Omio probably had been, but the final result was something you hadn't expected at all. When the redhead finished brewing her out of the cauldron came a long and shining piece of metal. How that had happened...you're still not sure, but at seeing the evidence being hauled into Omio's hand, via a large pink kitten paw pot holder, you cannot deny the result of this new experiment.[line break][line break]";
			say "[italic type]So I can transmute wood into metal. Given that I should be able to turn iron into either orichalcum or mythril.[roman type] Omio  seems to go off somewhere inside of her own head and while you might normally have not minded being outside of [']your['] head is now starting to become draining to the point of exhaustion. [italic type]Oh, sorry to keep you waiting. If you give me a moment then I'll fashion this into something slightly useful for you and then send it your way.[roman type] Nodding to the redhead you watch as Omio goes off before you have a chance to actually reply to her verbally...or would it be mentally in this case?[line break]";
			say "[italic type]Well, it's ready for you now![roman type] Omio squeaks as she comes out of her room while polishing a long rod about seven feet tall and one and a half inches wide. [italic type]I hope you like it.[roman type] Omio says before teleporting the weapon away to return it to you. Returning to yourself a second later you find the weapon perched perfectly in between your hands. Giving the rod a few test swings, after you've puked of course, you find that you have a good weapon on your hands as the pole is much stronger than the club and much lighter too. [line break]";
			say "Thanking Omio for her gift and then go about placing the rod down at your side so that you can lean on it as your knees are currently threatening to give out. [italic type]Consider it a gift for all of your hard work.[roman type] The redhead chuckles at you before sighing somewhat mournfully. [italic type]After everything that you've done for me I do want you to know that you have not only my gratitude, but also a place with me and my people within the Promethean society.[roman type][line break][line break]"; 
			say "[italic type]Though from what you've shown me you may not need to be taken care of nor provided for, so it may be me calling on you instead of the other way around later on. I hope you'll be willing to help me out, if I ever need it.[roman type] Telling the redhead that you'd think it over Omio simply nods at you before chuckling again.[line break]";
			say "[italic type]That's fine. I can accept that without problem. Anyway, if you ever need a place to stay then just come on over and hang out for a while. I'll be more than happy to share some tea with you.[roman type] When the sudden mental image of Omio moving to bow low to you filters through your mind's eye you can only chuckle and then shake your head at the crazy researcher. [line break]";
			say "An out of place feeling crosses your mind moments after your [']see['] Omio rise back up to her full height. The feeling is somewhat painful, but not in a physical way...more like...empty? Trying to understand what's going on you get the oddest sense that you may not see Omio again after the city is rescued...or sanitized. However, that can't be right. The other just asked you to come by and help her out sometime later on. Maybe you're just feeling lonesome since you'll probably not have a reason to see the other quite so often. Maybe going to her place to share some tea with Omio would be a good thing to do, whenever you have the time, that is.[line break]";
