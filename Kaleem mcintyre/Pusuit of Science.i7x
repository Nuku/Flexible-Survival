Section 3 - Pursuit of Science

gatherwolfcum is a number that varies.
gatherdemonseed is a number that varies.
gatherdogmilk is a number that varies.
Ointerrogate is a number that varies.

Pursuit of Science is a situation.  Pursuit of Science is resolved.

'If you will, then please bring me five samples of wolf cum, four samples of demon seed, and three samples of dog milk.' Omio asks somewhat indecisively. 'If you can manage that then I can move forward with my research and perhaps give you a reward that you may be able to use on your own journey throughout the city.'

Omio pauses for effect and then actually puts a finger underneath her chin to think about it. 'You know what...I don't think I actually remember. Was it south-something? Or was it Smithhaven? Or maybe Sicily?[line break]";

She's really not too hard to miss, but she can be somewhat elusive when she wants to be. Please find and bring me her milk so I can analyze it.'[line break]";

			say "'Having gathered all of the materials that I need I can most assuredly say that I and the group I represent are most pleased to have rendered your assistance in advancing our cause.'

'Because of your continued efforts I'll tell you more about our group, if you'd like.'(Y=Yes, N=No)[line break]";
			if player consents:
				say "'Alright. The group who I work under is a somewhat small organization, at the moment, that is trying to make a safe enough haven of this apocalyptic world so that mutants, like yourself and I, can go about to live and work and just be despite our budding feral-like natures.' You give Omio a funny look as try and figure out just exactly what part of her is [']mutated[']. The red head sees your roving eyes, but says nothing more about herself, instead she moves right along with her speech. 'With the world in the state it is now the military won't be able to do much other than succumb to the infection sooner or later, unless someone makes an strong enough vaccination to combat the source of the problem. But even then, if they do, so what?'[line break]";
				say "'So what if they do manage to make a vaccine? It's not a cure though. If you know them like I do then you already know that there is no cure for what's happening out there. There was never meant to be one in the first place when the infection was supposed to become wide spread, but now that it has gone underway against the desired time everyone in the military is silently aware that the new world about to be born will be one they can't do a damn thing about.' Omio seems to grow dire with her words and soon starts to circle around the room. Unlike before, however, when the red head was [']pulling your chain['] now you get the feeling that something much more calamitous is coming underway. And when next she speaks your fears and concerns are made real.[line break]";
				say "'As more and more mutations come into being there's a strong possibility that a new world war might flare up between the humans that are left [']uninfected['] and those mutants who won't accept being treated as a second class citizen. You've seen and heard of the civil wars fought before, well those will be nothing compared to what happens when a group of ill-tempered renegades stir up a small group and really bring things to a head with both guns and tempers blazing out of control. Just imagine it â€“ and entire group of wolves, lions and the like all marching together against a greater number of humans.' The picture that comes into your mind is a spooky one, but not one that's unfeasible. 'Even if the remaining humans managed to survive an onslaught like that what kind of precedence will this set for those not taking part in the conflict?'[line break]";
				say "'The people I support fear that this might happen, a [']them verses us['] kind of race war, so in hopes to nip such a thing into the bud [italic type]we[roman type] need to gather as much data as we can on the mutations running around now and build up a strong understanding of the biological, mental, and emotional needs of these new mutants. Its only in this way can we build up a strong enough foundation to work with the newly formulating government to set both laws and settlements where those mutants unable to intermix with the rest of the general public will be able to find a place to call home. I don't mean a reservation, I'm talking about maybe turning half the country over to my organization and making it a free state of mutants, if need be.[line break]";
				say "'The ferals aren't going to go anywhere anytime too soon, but we can't just let them run free forever.' Omio sighs heavily as she sits herself down onto her sofa. Looking over the somewhat tired red head you get the feeling that the conversation is over with. Though all of this information is rather much to take in, it does explain certain things about the future to come. Maybe helping Omio out more with her research will benefit everyone involved? Only time will tell. 'Anyway,' The red head gets up and then cheerfully smiles at you. 'You've done your work for me, so here are some gifts for you. Take them with my thanks.'[line break]";

		say "Coming up to Omio, who happens to be busy working on her computer, you cough to draw the woman from what she is doing and then jump back in surprise when the angry face of the red head greets you. Seeing that's it's just you Omio slowly lets her face settle back into her normally happy faÃ§ade, however, you make a mental not to be more careful around the other as that former look in the red head's golden eyes spoke of clear intent to bring down retribution onto someone's head. Whatever she was upset about must have had to do with her computer because upon getting up to greet you Omio quickly flips the monitor of the machine off, hiding whatever it was. 'Hey you, so glad you've come right now!'[line break]";
		say "Omio stretches and then reaches over to hug you tightly into her somewhat modest chest. 'I sooo need your help right now.' You try to ask the other what she needs, but sadly it gets muffled into the red head's warm and comfy feeling bosom. When Omio decides to let you go, some minutes later, you pant slightly as your [facename of player] face is somewhat very sweaty. Despite her size the red head is both very strong and has a very high body temperature. Odd, but then again, what in this strange world can be considered normal anymore? 'If you have some time I need you to do me a big favor.'[line break]";
		say "Asking the other what she needs you get a very big surprise. 'Well I need to examine a unicorn, but at the moment I don't want to leave my house because of [']circumstances['] beyond my control.' Omio scowls slightly and covers her chest with both of her arms and you get the feeling that something big must be up to make the normally bubbly red head so upset. 'Any who, because of this I would like for you to become a unicorn and then come back here so I can examine you.' At this you blink at Omio, the red head is smiling at you sincerely, and then ask her if she's lost her mind. When the other begins to giggle at you, you realize that â€“ yes â€“ she has indeed lost her mind.[line break]";
		say "'Nope. I need to draw both blood and other samples from a unicorn, as well as get a few shavings from its horn, so that I collect data on such a rare and mythical creature. Don't worry I know where you can find one to borrow some [']genetic material['] from.' Omio wags her eyes at you lewdly and then tells you about the Palomino where a unicorn barkeeper works. 'I'm sure he'd be very happy to help you out with becoming a unicorn, especially if you were to help him with a problem or two.' The red smiles again and you can only suck on your teeth as you wonder what you've gotten yourself into with this gold eyed harlot.[line break]";
		if bodyname of player is "Unicorn" and facename of player is "Unicorn":
			say "Omio nearly squeals, correction, she does squeal, as the red head looks over your impressive unicorn body and face and then gets up from her spot on the sofa to hug you tight. Grunting from the feel of the woman's strong grip you wonder if the other is some kind of behemoth-type mutant in disguise as you feel your ribs starting to creak slightly. Whinnying for the other to let you go you all but collapse as you suck in grateful gulps of air when the red head suddenly releases you. 'Thank you so much for this! I never would have thought that you would make such a [if cocks of player > 0]studly[otherwise if cunts of player > 0]charming[otherwise if cunts of player > 0 and cocks of player > 0]magnificent[end if]steed.'[line break]";
			say "Omio continues to squeal like a schoolgirl having her first crush while bouncing up and down like mad, but before you can get too weirded out by the red head's behavior the red head has her game face on and is looking at you with a stoic mask of professionalism. 'Now that you've acquired all of the genetic material needed with your transformation please sit down on the sofa while I go and get the tools needed to examine you.'[line break]";
			say "You find yourself nodding and whickering somewhat in disbelief at the sudden change of the other. Maybe she has some kind of weird personality disorder or something? Something about that woman is odd and looking at where Omio is heading as she disappears into the darkened area of her room you begin to wonder...[line break]";
			say "A slight shudder goes through you as you speculate over just exactly what the red head is going to do to you. However, you are not prepared for her to come back with a face mask strapped around her tanned nose and chin, a pair of white latex gloves on, a nurse's scrub covering her blue Chinese dress, while carrying an old fashion black leather doctor's bag that look like it had slipped through a time hole from the 1960s. 'Alright,' Omio says and your eyes nearly pop out of your skull when the woman comes over to you and then starts trying to undress you. 'I'm going to need you to get out of these and then prepare for some advance medical testing, the likes of which is not standardized by any health organization in America.'[line break]";
			say "You try and say something but all you can do is goldfish as the red head continues to try and loosen you from your only decent set of clothing. Sadly enough, you find the thought of being naked in front of Omio somewhat arousing and soon you are helping the golden eyed female to strip you down. Once you are fully naked Omio then proceeds to go about checking your blood pressure, examining both of your eyes and ears, measuring your arms, legs, chest and then shaving away bits of your glimmering horn to place the snippets into a small Petri dish.[line break]";
			say "Drawing blood and saliva from you and then storing the fluids into small test tubes Omio goes about asking you several questions while at the same time giving you no speculations as to her own thoughts. Some of the questions are a bit...personal...but you don't have much of a problem answering the other because of the strangely disarming nature in which the red head asks them. Once that is done the red head stands up and then looks you over completely. A playful light shimmers inside of Omio's golden eyes as she looks at your crotch.[line break]";
			if cunts of player > 0:
				say "'Alright then, just hold still while I conclude the last portion of the examination.' Omio chuckles and quickly you find yourself trying to back away from the other. You fearful retreat only succeeds in pushing yourself further into the red head's plush couch however, as a white gloved hand reaches down to dip to fingers into your open cunt. A whinny of pleasure turns into a moan as you feel Omio's, surprisingly thick digits, slip deeper and deeper into you until the red head has both of her knuckles buried inside of your unicorn pussy. Spreading your legs on instinct you buck and shiver as the wannabe doctor's fingers swirls her fingers around inside of your cunt while pressing a finger over the nub of your clit. Arching and panting your body feels like you're about to go into heat as your honey begins to leak out from the inside of your now gaping folds.[line break]";
				say "Seeing you in such a intriguing position Omio snickers and then brings the rest of her fingers together to bury all five of her digits into your oozing pussy. Pressing down deeper into you, you can't help but to throw back your head and then shout out a strong [italic type]NEIGH[roman type] when your fleshy lips flutter and then lock up tight around Omio's fingers. Holding the red head's hand down tight you buck and then screech as orgasm washed over you like a wave. Gouts of clearish blue nectar dribbles out of you and onto Omio's gloved hand as you climax powerfully until finally you have nothing left to give.[line break]";
				say "When you come down from off of your high you drop back down onto the sofa and then begin to pant like an overworked freight train. Mind whirling as though you've gone through an unbelievable experience, which technically you have, you blink your eyes open and then look down just in time to see Omio collecting your colorful nectar into a large jar. When the red head speaks next you can only twitch an eye as Omio's words sink deep into your brain. 'Thanks a lot for this sample! I never would have gotten old Harold to give me anything unless I raised my ass for him. But thankfully I didn't have to do that because you did instead!' The red head holds up the now capped jar and then pulls out a sharpie to label it. 'With this we can test some new theories to see if unicorn cum actually does extend one's life! Maybe if you feel like it you can work we me and my company later on to see if this is true or not?'[line break]";
				say "You pass out from exhaustion before you can comment on that one and when you wake up you have a hard time remembering what exactly happened, that is, until you find your clothes still in a puddle around you on the floor and your lap sticky with your spilled honey. Blushing slightly as the memories return to you, you listen as Omio rapidly taps onto her computer and then pull yourself up to get dressed before leaving out of the red head's house. In your backpack are several extra supplies that had been given over by Omio.[line break]";

				say "'Now donâ€™t worry none Mr. Stallion. I'm going to treat you really, really good.' Omio's fake Texan accent has you stammering slightly in disquietude, however, before you can do much of anything the other has her hands on your [cock of player] cock and is stroking it to full hardness. One would think that with latex gloves on the feeling of the red head stroking you would be uncomfortable, but that proves not to be so, especially as your precum starts to ooze from the tip of your slit on down over the length of your manhood. Grunting and whickering as you slowly start to thrust your hips up into the female's hand you can't help but groan as your eyes flutter close while your back arches from the exquisite hand job your getting.[line break]";
				say "You grip the sides of the couch with your meaty fingers when Omio brings up her other hand to begin twisting your cock with strong, but easy, pumps. Trying to hold onto your orgasm as you feel your balls quickly start to twitch between your legs you pant through clenched teeth while bucking almost frantically up into Omio's talented hands. It's sadly, or rather wonderfully, a losing battle for you as Omio seems to know exactly what she's doing. Stroking down the thick pulsing veins on your organ the red head quickly proceeds to finish you off quickly when she moves one of her hands down to tease at your balls. A playful chuckle from Omio echoes in your twitching ears as the red continues to milk you in an effort to get out your churning load of cum -- her hands are now moving in a rapid paced motion up and down your cock almost becoming a white blur to you.[line break]";
				say "When you climax it's with a lively [italic type]NEIGH[roman type]. Grunting and then shouting your ecstasy to the world you fire your cum up out of your cock with almost rocket-like force, hitting the top of Omio's living room ceiling hard enough that your teal blue spooge actually splatters like paint hitting asphalt. Blinded by the stars popping across your vision you never notice how the red head backs away from you and then pulls out a large jar to collect your spurting cum up off of your lap. All you notice is blissful darkness as you pass clean out from the exertion of such a breathtaking orgasm.[line break]";
				say "When you wake up from your inopportune nap you have a hard time remembering what exactly happened, that is, until you find your clothes still in a puddle on the floor and your lap sticky with dried cum. Blushing slightly as the memories return to you, you listen as Omio rapidly taps onto her computer and then pull yourself up to get dressed before leaving out of the red head's house.

			say "'Remember I need your body to be that of a unicorn and your head to be that of a unicorn so that I can collect some samples.' Omio says before winking up at you. 'Oh and also, don't forget, that the guy you are looking for is in the club named the Palomino. The place should be downtown somewhere, if it hasn't been overrun already by the ferals running around.' Omio hums thoughtfully as she says this, her face is tight with contemplation.[line break]";
	if omq is 3:
		say "A somewhat loud explosion throws you back against the patio door of Omio's research studio. Grunting from the wave of pain spiking through your body you close your eyes just in time for a miasma of black smoke to come rushing out at you. Enveloped by darkness, and slightly injured, you find yourself getting to your feet somewhat slowly while at the same time calling out for Omio. Fanning the front of your nose when the scent of burnt [']feline?['] has you sneezing in reflex you call out again for the red headed researcher to answer you.[line break]"; 
		say "Glimmering golden orbs shine directly into your face a moment or two later from inside of a large grey cloud of soot and ash. 'Yes? Is everything alright?' The cool tone in the red head researcher's voice has you backing up some as Omio suddenly sounds very...different...for some reason.[line break]"; 
		say "Telling the other that you worried about her and wanted to know if she was alright, Omio chuckles at you before she sweeps her hand in front of her golden eyes to dispel the black smoke away from her face. Like magic...and mildly you wonder if that is exactly what it is...Omio bats the clouds of darkened smoke out of her house through the open patio door and the chimney, respectfully. A small gale rips through the living room area a second later and soon you and the red head are standing face-to-face in a...slightly...disarrayed household. 'Now then maybe that will make it better for you to see me, wouldnâ€™t you agree?'[line break]";
		say "You're not sure what to say to the red head as you simply blink in confusion. Wasn't she just in the middle of a large explosion? From the look of her you don't see anything out of place on the red head, well save for her blue Chinese dress being somewhat dirty. Trying to open your mouth to ask Omio how she just did what she did you get a raised hand and then a single wag of a tanned finger. 'Don't worry about the little things right now.' The red head smiles before winking. Obviously she must be okay because her former teasing mannerisms have returned. 'So what can I do for you today?'[line break]";
		say " Shaking your head and regaining your wits you ask Omio if there was something you could do to help her clean up the place, as you have totally forgotten why you have come to see her in the first place. Omio hums pensively to herself at your open offer. 'Well, you know I could use some more materials now that I've wasted my own on my little failure of a [']project[']. Do you think you could do go out and bring me back several pieces of spotted fur from the Leopardmen running around the high rise district and some tainted wool from the rams that should be running around outside of that bunker of yours? Five pieces of material each would be nice.'[line break]";
		say "You find yourself nodding and turning to fetch what the other had just asked for, but before you can take too many steps you stop dead as you go over what Omio said. Whipping back around you ask the red head how she knew about the bunker where[if Sarah is in bunker and Fang is in bunker]your companions are staying[otherwise]Trixie is hiding[end if]safely out of harm's way, you find Omio waving you off somewhat whimsically. 'I know everything there is to know about the people I deal with. I couldn't be a successful researcher any other way.' The flippant air coming from off of Omio has you narrowing your eyes at the red head. Again, that strange feeling that you need to be careful around the woman surges up throughout you.[line break]";
		say "Yet despite this feel of uncertainty surrounding the other gathering the materials Omio has requested is more important...for now.[line break]";
		if Spotted fur is fiveowned:
			say "You get the feeling that you don't have the right amount of material Omio needs to complete -- whatever it is â€“ the red head was working on. You realize that you'll have to do some more hunting in order to gather the five pieces of Spotted fur before you can hand over what Omio needs.[line break]";
		otherwise if Spotted fur is fiveowned and Tainted wool is fiveowned:
			say "With the five pieces of spotted fur in hand you feel good inside about giving the red head the materials she needs, but then you stop as you remember that you have to fetch some tainted wool.[line break]"; 
		if Tainted wool is fiveowned:
			say "Remembering that you need to get five pieces of tainted wool for Omio you recall that the red head said something about there being sheep outside in the city[if nes >= 1]. You bear in mind that there were rams running around outside looking for one of their lost flock, so maybe hunting some of them down would be wise[otherwise]? But where in the world would sheep hide in the middle of a city infested with roving mutants?[end if][line break]";
		if Tainted wool is fiveowned and Spotted fur is fiveowned:
			say "With the tainted wool in your backpack now would be a good time to head back to Omio to give the red head the materials she had requested. Oh, but wait! Didn't she need some spotted fur as well?[line break]";
		if Spotted fur is fiveowned and Tainted wool is fiveowned and omq is 3:
			say "Omio chuckles at you and then politely reminds you of what she needs, her golden eyes shine coolly as looks into your [facename of player] face. 'I need five pieces of spotted Leopardman fur and five pieces of tainted wool from those rams outside. Please make sure to bring them back and in a timely fashion, ok?' The red head winks at you and you get the disturbing feeling as though she's up to something.[line break]";
		otherwise if Spotted fur is fiveowned and Tainted wool is fiveowned:
			say "Omio nods to you in a calculated manner as she takes the materials off of your hand and then moves over to the cauldron she always has boiling inside of her fireplace. 'Thank you so much for this, because of you I can now create the thing that I was trying to craft earlier.' Asking her what she is planning to do with the fur and wool you collected you find yourself stepping up next to Omio's side when the researcher waves you over. Your eyes widen in some confusion as the red head nonchalantly dumps the fur and wool into the steaming broth of pinkish-purple liquid that is bubbling inside of her cauldron. 'It might not be very scientific, but watch this,'[line break]";
			say "You say nothing as Omio takes a wooden ladle and then plunks it into the pot to start stirring the contents around. From what you can see the tainted wool and spotted fur seem to be mixing together like spices being put into a soup, but that couldn't be possible, right? 'Could you hand me the red vial off of my computer table?' Doing so without question you run over to the desk, look over the several assorted vials standing together inside of a small black case, and then grab the red vial as asked. Taking it back over to Omio you watch as she looks over the liquid and then uncorks the vial before dumping the crimson solution into the cauldron.[line break]";
			say "Upon touching the pinkish-purple pool the red liquid immediately transforms the mixture a sickly green color. You have to take a step back as white smoke fills up the area around both you and Omio. Covering your nose as the smell of sulfur cloys at your nose you cough slightly while wondering how the red head can stand such a detestable smell. You don't have long to wonder because soon Omio is chirping, rather loudly at that, as she looks over the fur and wool flowing together to become one large mass. Returning to looking at the mixture you find your jaw almost hitting the floor when you see Omio pull out a large mass of...[']spotted cotton[']?[line break]";
			say "'Finally! This is proof that we can synthesize new fabrics and other substances from the infected hides and pelts of other mutants.' Omio says matter-of-factly. Quietly you ask the other why she needed to obtain this information. 'Because by the time the situation here in the city is resolved, or at least contained, I don't think that there will be many natural based resources available on earth that the average person will be able to keep covering their bodies without becoming infected.' Omio turns to give you a solemn stare.[line break]"; 
			say "'Think about it, you got this material from an infected sheep, now imagine what would happen if/when a farmer that supplies cotton to a large industry lets his herd become tainted without his knowledge. And then imagine what will happen if steps aren't taken to check over a shipment of infected cotton in order to neutralize the virus?'[line break]";
			say "'That's hundreds to thousands of pounds of cotton that could have a ram/ewe viral strains on them. If that gets out to a country that's not fully vaccinated then that's thousands to maybe even millions of people that could end up growing sheepskin and hooves before anyone knows what has happened. There's no way that that can be allowed to happen. You have to realize that the clothes you wear absorb both sweat and skin cells from off of you so when you put them on you are basically re-infecting yourself again. It's just that the virus can be so strong in one person/creature that unless you have gained the ability to withstand infections you're constantly being physical changed so much that one strain doesn't linger for very long inside of you. Not unless you physically make an effort to hold onto a particular type of infection.'[line break]";
			say "'However, with the city in the state that it is in no too many people are really running around in clothes right at the moment, save for the military and maybe a few select others.
