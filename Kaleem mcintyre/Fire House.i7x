The description of Fire Station 86 is "At the far end of the downtown red light district area stands a red brick firehouse rising up almost virtuously in protest of the depravity that has currently taken hold of the once prominent metropolis. Immaculate as the day she had been first opened, the numbers 86 gleam almost smugly across the front side of the building. [if Kenaztalk is 0]From the way the garage doors are void of the usual sticky mess of cum, milk and other fluids it would seem as though someone has been taking especially good care of the place. Wondering if that said someone is still inside, and hoping that if they are they have kept some of their humanity intact, you walk over to the single garage door and then bang on the front to try and get somebody's attention. A minute or two later the large metal door rolls up, allowing you entrance. Entering into the cool building, you find that the firehouse is exactly as you would have imagined it to be[else]Wondering how Kenaz is doing you head for the door of the firehouse and then knock on the door. It takes less than a minute for the other man to come open the door for you[end if].".

Off to the left side of the building is a large, gleaming golden pole that leads up to an open hole in the ceiling, the structure accompanied by a small flight of stairs to permit easy access to the floor above. A darkened office sits off to the side by one of the unused fire trucks, and a bunch of chairs have been set up next to the garage doors surrounding a large table covered with playing cards. Over by the right side of the building, a number of firefighter suits are hanging off of coat hooks next to several metal lockers[if findwires is 2 and fixedgens is 2]. The entire area is kept lit by some of those Japanese lanterns that you sometime see during summer festivals at the State Fair, so that would explain why everything is so bright despite the power of the city not working properly[end if]. Because of the light, it's easy to see a large number of rolled up hoses being kept in place along an empty expanse of wall. Right above the coiled tubes lay several ladders that have been stacked together on a high-end metal shelf.";

	say "     With Kenaz being turned into a Dalmatian along with the rest of the firefighters the firehouse has fallen in standards slightly. The fire trucks are not as polished as they had once been. The metal lockers stand open with clothing draped on or over them. The floor is slightly gunky with the residue of cum stains on them and there are traces of dog hair all over the place. While not exactly as bad as it could be the firehouse literally screams [bold type]bachelor's pad[roman type] now. Kenaz looks to be trying to keep things straight by sweeping, dusting and moping, but the green eyed firefighter seems to be constantly getting distracted...usually by the way of the others coming over to try and fuck him at the most inopportune times.";

The red fire engines shine proudly under the lights coming from the [if findwires is 2 and fixedgens is 2]florescent lamps up above[else]Japanese lanterns set into place around the firehouse[end if], having just recently been washed and waxed. The firefighter's lockers have also been washed off, but are now kept shut instead of just dangling open as they once had been. The chairs and table that had been set in front of the firehouse's twin garage doors have been moved over out of the way. And, to top everything off, the other Dalmatians are now mostly running mock drills or else doing something constructive with their time while underneath the guidance of the newly transformed Dalmatian herm.";

Along the back of the firefighter's head a long ponytail sways lightly as Kenaz swings his head back and forth while listening out for trouble. At five foot eleven inches tall, Kenaz possesses bright green eyes, a somewhat thin, but muscled form and is wearing a pair of dark navy jeans, white shirt, and has a firefighter helmet on. The latter is kept on as a good luck charm for the firefighter, or so he says. Unlike many people within the city Kenaz is both completely human and fully male, if the bulge inside of the firefighter's pants and lack of breasts anywhere on him are any indication of things. Odd considering everything that's going on, but then again...";

The Dalmatian firefighter wags his thin white tail around joyfully while barking playfully at you as you come up to him. It's easy to see that despite his breathtaking transformation the other is still a firefighter at heart as Kenaz still has on his old fire helmet, which now possess holes for his new floppy ears to protrude through, while he [one of]busies himself with speaking with one of his pack-mates about drills or something[or]wrestles with some of the other guys on the floor while the others cheer him on[or]sweeps the floor while growling at some of the Dals about cleaning up their fur[or]tries not to lose at the game of poker he and three others are playing[or]grumbles at some of the other guys mating on the floor of the firehouse[or]waxes down the fire trucks[at random].

However, instead of this making the new herm into a slutty submissive bitch Kenaz seems to have gained a bit more ire about himself as he clearly has taken over dominating all of the other Dal boys inside of the firehouse. It's easy to tell that the former passive male is now a force to be reckoned with as whenever the other passes by the tails of the rest of the firefighters all go to curling downwards. Not to say that this is a bad thing though, because the fire station looks as though it has never been cleaner. Maybe this transformation has been a good thing for Kenaz? You're not sure, but it has made his bedroom antics very much different from before.";

This makes the firefighter smile despite the uncertainty you can sense he's feeling as he surveys your [bodyname of player] form and [facename of player] face gazing back at him. 'It's a good thing that you knocked because if you hadn't I'd have never let you in here.' Kenaz chuckles some, but you get the strangest suspicion that there is something more the other man wants to add to that statement.";

You can go have a seat while I put the food on the makeshift grill I've got setup.' Doing as asked you head over to the only empty table in the room and then look around the fire station while waiting for Kenaz to return. From what you can see Kenaz has kept the place up to code as far as cleanliness goes, however, over by the other side of the garage you notice that the firefighter has blockade the front door of the building off with various pieces of paraphernalia around the station. Your host comes back minutes later with something hot and steaming and you can feel your stomach rumbling from hunger. 'It's not much but I have some soup that we can share. I hope you don't mind chicken noodle.'";

When Kenaz places a spoon in front of you, you take only a second to thank the man before grabbing the utensil and then digging into your soup. 'Whoa, whoa, slow down there soldier, I have more if you want some extra to eat.' You look up to tell the firefighter that it's been a while since you've had something so good before lowering your eyes back to the yellow broth as you finish off your meal.";
			say "     Kenaz laughs at this and then takes his own spoon to start in on his own meal. Ten minutes later, after a second helping, both of you Kenaz sit back and then begin sharing exploits. Laughing at some of the things the other man has to tell you about his life, both before this current crisis as well as during, you come to find yourself liking Kenaz more and more as the firefighter speaks to you in soft, even tones while letting his green eyes twinkle at you almost teasingly. 'So in the end we're both basically been dealt a bad hand by lady luck,' Kenaz says as he looks to you somewhat resignedly.";

Kenaz rushes a hand through his through his shaggy auburn mop top and then starts to play with the ponytail at the back of his head. 'This big place is kinda creepy without the usual banter of everyone either talking, yelling, or horsing around, ya know? Well technically I guess you wouldn't since you're not a...never mind.'";
			say "     Kenaz tries not to show it but it's easy to see that the other man is in deep discontent without his teammates around. Idly you wonder if any of them could have survived the epidemic with their minds intact, and, if at all possible, if any of them were still within the city. On the fly you ask Kenaz about his coworkers. 'Well, there's not much to tell. We were all taking a small vacation before our [italic type]reassignment[roman type] to other departments at the behest of the [italic type]oh so intelligent[roman type] mayor and his fatass cohort, who just so happens to be our captain.'";
			WaitLineBreak;

It's only when you cough in your own throat that Kenaz quickly picks up on what he's doing. 'S-sorry, that's been happening a lot as of late. I think the virus or whatever is getting to me, but thankfully it's not that bad. Not unless I get upset or...' Kenaz shrugs somewhat helplessly. 'Anyway, Birch and I were the last guys here who stuck around to see about the place before the station got closed down. But, as cliché as it sounds, Birch did stop showing up a few days before the crisis hit the city.";
			say "     I went to check his girlfriend's apartment - that's the place where he usually hangs out when not off duty - but the landlady said she hadn't seen either in a while.' Kenaz smiles haphazardly after saying this. Nodding to the other you realize what he might have been thinking. Thanking Kenaz for the food you decide that maybe asking around town might net you some information about the other firefighters. Maybe trying an informer might help?";

A sudden slam against the garage doors has your back tensing as you turn to look towards the metal divides separating you and Kenaz from the outside world. Another resounding slam, this time much louder, has Kenaz on alert. When a third strike hits at the metal dividers the half Asian man's brows slowly begin to furrow as his green eyes turn hard like ice.

The only ones left around here was me and Birch, but a little while before thing started to get crazy he went out and didn't come back. I went to his girlfriend's place to look for him, but the landlady at the apartment complex said that she hadn't seen either of them in days. I hope he got out before anything happened...else...' Kenaz goes quiet at that. Seeing the other man's distress you ask Kenaz about the others, but the firefighter's only response is a sigh and a slow shake of his head.";

Asking what happened to the captain over the firehouse you raise an eyebrow when Kenaz snorts all of a sudden. 'That fatass is the one who gave everyone the paid time off! Of course, that was right after he told us that this station was going to be shut down in a few months and everyone would be relocated elsewhere. Something about a decision the mayor made or some such nonsense.'";
				say "     A growl from Kenaz has you stepping back from the other as he sounds all too canine right about now. 'Oops, sorry about that. I think whatever's in the air here has gotten to me.' Kenaz laughs, but it sounds way too forced to be real. 'Anyway, I don't have much to tell you. Just that everyone's gone and I'm the only one left around.' At that Kenaz shuts down all conversation...for the moment anyway.";
				say "     Looking to the green eyed fireman and then around to the almost tomb-like firehouse you begin to wonder if there is some way to find out about the members of this station. Maybe getting in contact with an informant might be wise? But where does one find an informant?";

Watching as the auburn haired firefighter begins to removes his makeshift barricade you nod to the other's back and then turn to look around the firehouse. Seeing exactly what you need sitting by the side of a makeshift grill you go over, pick up the item, give it a few test swings and then step up behind Kenaz.";

Yelping in dismay, you grab the top of your scalp and then flip your head around to have a look at whoever just assaulted you. 'Now you know how I feel,' Kenaz says somewhat smugly before dropping the thing in his hand to let it clatter loudly down onto the ground.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     You try and apologize to the other man, but Kenaz simply waves you off. The rueful smile on his face tells you of the firefighter's appreciation for what you did. 'Want some water?'

It takes the other man a minute to return but once he does Kenaz has both a bottle of water and two ice packs in hand, though one of the packs is covering the firefighter's own head. 'I thank you for the save, but seriously?' You can only shrug after Kenaz hands you the water and ice pack. Twisting the cap of the bottle open you swallow the water while at the same time pressing the offered ice pack over you throbbing head. The two of you say nothing for a long while, simply enjoying each other's company, even though the both of you are in shared pain.";

'The guys, I mean the other firefighters, I kinda miss them.' You chuckle as you ask him to elaborate a bit more. 'We all were supposed to be getting some time off before being relocated since the station is going to be closing soon because of the damn mayor. The fatass captain and his crony in the downtown office decided that there doesn't need to be a more than one firehouse per burrow and since station 83 is just three miles away from here...'

Kenaz coughs at that and then shakes his head. It's not hard to figure out the unspoken finish to that sentence. 'Anyway, the guys have all gone off somewhere or another so it's just me here. I wouldn't mind it, but every day those [']things['] outside come around and I have to fight them off. That's why you didn't need to hit me to stop me since I know what I'm getting myself into.'

'Don't know, everyone was supposed to be going out of town or something so that only left me and Birch around to watch over the place. Since the two of us basically live here we didn't really mind it. But after he left and didn't come back I went to his girlfriend's apartment to check on him.";

Had this been any place but the town you live in you would have thought the other was crazy, but all things considered...

At the time I couldn't have cared less, what with my leg bleeding like I had an artery burst, however, when the blonde said that the name Pertho I immediately started to grill her for info.

The fact that the other's hair is pulling down the side of his head, growing thicker and more luxurious is of little consequence to all present as the superficial additions cannot outshine the fact that the grunting and whimpering firefighter on the floor is in utter agony because of his change. Hands spreading out onto the floor, pushing up because of new pads replacing the former soft palms belonging to Kenaz don't help to ease the transition for the other, especially not when these new paw pads introduce much thicker fingernails with them.

With his pants having been stripped free from his body you can see Kenaz's thighs and legs contorting and shifting as the firefighter's lower body gains canine-like attributes. Heels raising up as both feet begin to expand, the same as with the firefighter's hands, while toenails turn sickly black in color, only to then protrude out almost an inch a half from the man's foot make it clear that Kenaz is going to have a digitigrade stance once this is all over with.

A furry sheath forms at the lower end of Kenaz's cock, the perfect home for the new organ the firefighter now has while at the same time Kenaz's balls expand slightly while growing furry as a veritable wave of white fur rushes over the former human's sac.";

As it would seem Mannaz, who just so happened to have been out of town on vacation when he heard about the epidemic taking over the city, had been able to barter his way back into the city by way of becoming a temporary go between for the military and the outside world. Apparently the military didn't have as many soldiers as the outside world like to believe and with the constant infection take a good percent of their numbers every week they were running short staffed.";

'Well, would you be mad if I told you I was afraid of doing that?' The firefighter blushes somewhat as he rubs the back of his head while blushing.

So I figured staying with them was much better than trying to come back here and get infected. But wouldn't you know it,' Mannaz chuckles ruefully at this point.

Maybe there's something wired in him to make Pertho want to infect other humans. I don't want to test that theory though, but still...it's the best I have to go by at the moment.'
