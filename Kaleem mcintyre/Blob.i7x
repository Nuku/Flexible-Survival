Section 1 - Creature Responses


to say Blobdesc:
	setmongender 0; [creature is neuter-X]
	say "The Blob is a large, amorphous mass of green and orange goo that has collected together from the slime and organic matter of other creatures it has absorbed. Large and unwieldy the mass seems to be somewhat aware of itself, and you by turn, the gel-like creature prepares to defend itself from the biting cold by lashing at everything around it. Out sizing you by almost six times your length, tough enough to break fiber glass, and floating somewhat because of bioelectrical power of the living beings it assembled into itself, the Blob is ready to fight for its life.";


to say Blobattack:
	say "[one of]Grabbing you with a tentacle, the Blob throws you into a nearby wall![or]Spiking the outer shell of itself like a porcupine protecting itself, the Blob charges at you![or]Warbling with a loud cry the Blob lets out an ear piercing shriek![or]Hovering slightly the Blob throws out several tentacles wildly in your direction![or]Sensing your attack the Blob curls in on itself to block your attack and then lashes out wildly at you![or]Spreading itself out into a large mass the Blob surges like a wave towards you![or]Becoming like that of a large funnel the Blob sucks you into itself and then spins you around before spitting you back out onto the floor![at random]";


to say losetoBlob:
	say "     The wiggling and amorphous mass is quick to grab you with one of its tentacles and then bring you bodily into itself. Struggling as vainly as you can with your limited strength there is not much for you to do as you are engulfed into the giant blob-like mass. However, your suffering has only begun. Because of its inherent nature to disassemble living organisms into itself the blob is able to slowly break you down into itself pieces by pieces. The feeling of your senses slowly dulling and then shutting completely down is followed after the loss of other pieces of your form. First legs and arms and tail, followed by sight, scent, and then sensation as everything just starts to fade to black. If this was the worst part then that might be ok, however, because of the beast having a consciousness made up of other mutants you can still [']feel['] even though you cannot control yourself.";
	say "     The knowledge of the other mutants inside of the creature filters into your mind just as your own flows into theirs and then subsequently into the gelatinous mass of slime. Understanding that the controls for the flash freeze are still in the main terminal room one of your/the blob's tentacles reaches out to destroy the fiber glass protecting the room and then the machinery, instantly stopping the creature's/your own destruction. With that taken care of the room soon starts to reheat, much to the blob's/your own pleasure and soon the blob is sinking back down into the cool water below. Idle and quiet no one will figure out what has happened, not until soldier's come later to try and restore the city's water...but by then there will be no more you/blob, there will just be the blob. Ready to amass more organic matter into itself to grow larger...and more self-aware.";


to say beattheBlob:
	say "     Having fought the creature enough to wear it down, not to mention draw its attention to you rather than the main control terminal, the Blob is quick to solidify icily as the reservoir freezes to close to below 0. Now much smaller than it had been in the beginning, the amorphous creature seems almost harmless as it sits there both [italic type]still[roman type] and compliant before you. However, knowing that this might not be true when the reservoir heats back up, you don't wait as you charge for the creature again and then slam into it with a vicious kick. When you flip back from you attack you watch as tiny splinters in the shell of the creature appear like cracks on a frozen pond about to break. Moving back a little further you watch in fascination as the monster's body fragments more and more until finally exploding into crystalline shards.";
