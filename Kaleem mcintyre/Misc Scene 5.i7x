When her stray tresses begin to flutter through the air you lower your mouth in awe as you watch the woman stroke a tanned hand back behind her billowing hair. Then, before you can move some of the butterflies come over to playful dance alongside her hair. None of the insect-like creatures seem to be remotely interested in sexually trying to entice the woman into relieving herself from the black cowl she has wrapped around her figure. Instead the butterflies seem to be almost trying to make the woman smile as they circle around her, making her eyes track their movements as they move quickly back and forth before her face. This doesn't make the woman's lip rise from their downcast frowning, but her eyes do begin to twinkle slightly. The sight of several other butterflies coming over to aid their friends['] efforts makes you feel something at peace on the inside as you continue to watch the other for several minutes before blinking as you notice the woman turning to start walking away. Thankfully though the woman and her butterfly entourage are moving opposite of where you are. Gulping and feeling like a voyeur you make your way about your business as swiftly as you can. The sight of the woman will stay with you a long while after though.";

Curious as to what the joke is you walk over to the slightly parted doorway and then push at the wood barrier carefully with your foot to get a better look inside. What you come to find is a small collective of half changed guys all piled around while playing video games together in front of a big screen TV. The dorm boys don't seem to be bothered by the fact that they are losing their humanity as the two collie boys nudging each another on the couch seem much more interested in whatever game their competing against. Back behind them two other students, a cougar and panther, respectfully, stand tall while pointing, jeering and laughing at their friend's antics. Seeing this you pull yourself away from your position by the door to walk away on down the hall. It feels good to know that some things will never change despite the epidemic going on.";

Not really sure, but feeling as though you should go and have a look to see what the problem is you make your way over to the half open door and then stick your head inside of the room. What you see is a small puma girl being held in the arms of a larger Siberian tiger girl as the smaller feline cries and nuzzles her forming snout into her friend's shoulder. 'I-I can't go home like this, Carol!' The puma lifts her head to yowl up at the white tiger.";

The soft sweeps of the bigger cat's tongue over the smaller feline's face seem almost loving as the white tiger consoles her friend. 'It'll be fine Liz.' The tigress starts to say as pulls herself back to stare at the other girl. 'If push comes to shove and they don't take you back then you can just move in with me and my folks!' The tigress purrs to the other before pulling the puma girl close. 'I know my folks would love to have you as a second daughter since all they've got, besides me, is a bunch of good-for-nothing sons.' The white tigress smiles while saying this.";

Smiling at Carol the puma says, 'A-are you sure? I mean, I know that there's not much space back at home for you and I wouldn't want to be an imposition and...' The puma continues to blabber on and on before a white furred finger comes up to hush her. Said finger shortly removes itself only to be replaced by firm lips as Carol leans down to kiss the smaller feline onto the lips. Liz seems not to know what to do with herself at first, but she quickly gets an idea as she gives herself over to her obvious girlfriend while lying back against the couch the two are seated on.";

The veritable orgy going on around you is so hot and wild that you feel yourself getting quite hot as you look at the multiple furry figures standing, sitting and laying around and fucking each other.

Seeing the other's fat breasts jumping up and down while the hermaphrodite fucks her current lover, you smile somewhat perversely while imagining how full this [']king of beasts['] must be feeling right about now at this slightly strange role reversal. Snickering, you turn your eyes away from the rutting feline pair to the stallion and ocelot couple mating just five feet off to the side. The small cat is sitting on the tiles with his back against the wall while pumping the much larger horse up and down onto his overly long dick with a steady series of pumps of his arms. From what you can see of the horse's foot and a half long piece of male meat, the other is loving being fucked like a mare -- if the gushing flared head was any testament to the stallion's feelings. Though it is slightly strange to see the bigger male being taken by the smaller feline, but then again you surmise that size had nothing to do with the want to be the receptive partner. Moving your gaze over to a cheetah and rabbit, both of whom are girls and sixty-nining each other while lying horizontal on the floor, you have to tilt your head to the side to see clearly just how deeply both female's tongues are burying themselves into each other's snatch. And from what you can see, their twosome is going pretty deep into one another. Wet and sticky with their respective honey, both female's legs and faces are drenched in the other's feminine juices. It's only after you turn your head completely to the right that you see the last person in the room standing tall against the wall.";

Tall, imposing and impossibly muscular, the black bear anthro watches you with a cautious glare as he stands with his arms folded over his chest. Not quite understanding why, or rather how, the other is resisting this smorgasbord of carnal delight, you walk over to talk to him to ask him just that. 'You coming to join the orgy, kid?' The ursine speaks with a voice that clearly has some age behind it. You blink twice before answering back that you were going to ask him the very same question, all the while trying your hardest to figure just how old this guy was. The black bear chuckles at you almost ruefully as watches confusion dance on your face. 'Before this whole thing started, I was a married gym teacher. So unlike the group in front of me, I've got more control over myself.' The bear puffs up proudly, but then flushes some when you give him a [']look['].

The musky smell of sweat and testosterone is heavy here, but surprisingly there is little cum or female juice wafting about on either the walls or the training equipment. Raising an eyebrow at this you figure out why as you notice a large wolverine standing by the door you just entered through. The large and slightly hunched over male is draped in barely any clothing, but from what you can see as you walk next to him he is far from aroused as he looks over the students assembled within the room with a calculating look in his dark eyes. Either this man was once one of the gym teachers before the epidemic and watching out over the place to make sure that it stayed in top shape, or either he had been put here by someone else to do the same thing. Either way from the look the wolverine gives you as you enter into the room you can see in his eyes that he won't accept any nonsense from you. Nodding to him while making sure to keep an arm's length of space between the two of you, you go over to have a better look at the gym and its surroundings.";

Not far from them there were several more canines jogging on treadmills while next to them several athletic felines used various weight machines to strength themselves. Over by the rightmost wall there were three students -- a rabbit, a lemur and collie -- were busy doing pushups, and from the looks of things they were making a contest of it. Seeing everyone working so hard makes you want to try and do something yourself.

Going at an increased speed feels much, much better to you and in running faster you let your mind and thoughts simply slip away as you move on instinct. Before long you notice the sounds of others around you and you turn your head to see several of the student body looking at you with praise on their faces to see you going so fast. Not really understanding you look down and then note that you are going almost faster than a cheetah as your legs move of their own accord. Seeing this and then feeling your heart hammering inside of your body at a breakneck pace you decide to slow down before you hurt something.

What you find is that the weight you have set is so minuscule that you nearly send the plates of iron up to the roof. Not feeling the strain that you know you should be feeling you blink to yourself in confusion as you look at the now hovering piece of metal. Slowly releasing the handlebar you get up and then return to the backside of the stack machine to replace the pin under a greater set of plates before returning to your seat.

Blushing and then smiling nervously you nod to thank them and then proceed to leave out of the room. Sadly you don't manage to do so without several slaps across the ass and a few offers to [']meet up later['] being tossed you way. The wolverine guard growls out loud when he sees that things are about to get out of control and immediately everyone scatters to go back to what they doing.

A group of four of leather jacket clad wolves is busy playing cards over by the right side of the roof -- most of them are growling and baiting each other with snaps of their muzzles.

His clothes sit atop the unusable machine in a bright blue basket. 'Eric, there's nothing we can do about it right now,' the shire says before whinnying in mild vexation.

Before the Doberman could come to regret his words the big shire grabs the Doberman's clothes basket, runs over to where the word TRASH is written onto the wall, opens the door to the garbage chute and then tosses the clothes inside. Once the dirty articles disappear down the void of the open doorway Carl kicks the garbage shoot close and then heads back over to the now stunned and sputtering Dobie. 'See, problem solved!'";

	say "'Are you crazy! Those were some of my best clothes!' Eric shouts while growling at the bigger male. 'Well, you weren't going to wear them since they were dirty, right?' Carl winks and then whickers at his friend. 'Not the point! Now all I've got to wear is these boxers around the dorms and they can barely even... Carl why are you looking at me like that?' The Doberman took a few steps back from the shire as the bigger horse begins to advance on him. The slightly maniac look on the other's muzzle spoke volumes. 'Carl, don't you dare! Don't even think about it! Carl!! DON'T!!!' Before the Dobie can say anything else the stallion was diving for the other. Have a one-third-ton-sized horse flying towards him the Doberman stop dead in his tracks and this turns out to be exactly what the shire wants as he grapples the other to the floor, tears Eric's boxers shorts off of his black and brown hide and then proceeds to toss them casually over his shoulder. Now with the two of them naked the Doberman can only whimper and whine as Carl begins to touch and fondle him. 'See, my doggie's got a nice, thick bone ready to show the world.' The shire speaks with both a tease and some adoration in his voice as he starts to pump Eric's sheath with one of his meaty hands. 'I so hate you right now.' The Dobie grunts and tries to snarl, but his words are soon lost in a moan as he pumps his hips up and down into his [']boyfriend's['] hand. 'I know, but you'll be loving me in about the next ten seconds, so I really don't mind.' Carl snickers as he coaxes the fullness of his lover's cock out of the Dobie's sheath.";

	say "Knowing where this was going you pull your head back from out of the doorway and then turn to leave about your way. An idle thought shoots through your mind over about what the Doberman meant when he called himself [']meager['] because from what you could see Eric was packing some serious heat in between his thighs. Maybe he's one of those insecure kinda guys, you think as you move along the downstairs area of the campus.";
