Section 1 - Important Treasure

Important Treasure is a situation.

		say "The sight of something white dashing across your vision makes you turn your head just in time to see a short... [']something['] run right past you. Not understanding what you've just seen you try and follow the other as it steadily speeds down the street ahead of you. Moving as fast as you can the white hooded figure turns out to be very fleet of foot and soon they have outpaced you by almost four blocks. You give up trying to follow after them when you find yourself growing short of breath.[line break]";
	else if opcl is 1:
		say "Searching around the red light district you stumble across a beautiful blonde woman standing roughly five and a half feet tall who fits the description Omio had given to you almost to a [']T[']. With an oversized white coat draped over her slim body, a stitched up scar cutting a path over the front of her nose, and black pair of jeans on the woman should have stuck like a sore thumb in the middle of the city's more ill repute area. And yet, for some reason or another, the blonde seems to possess an all-encompassing autonomy about herself that make her almost invisible to naked eye.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Going over to the other you open your mouth to speak, but soon clamp your muzzle shut when the woman quickly cloaks her hood over her face and then takes off like a shot in the opposite direction you had just come from. Not understanding what just happened you reach up to scratch your head in confusion. That is, right up until you hear someone calling out behind you. 'Hey you over!' Turning around you find yourself jumping back in bewilderment as the scaly face of a four-armed green and black mottled iguana wearing a police officer's uniform marches directly up to you. 'What are you doing out here? Are you friends with that woman? Do you know where she's going? Hey, I'm talking to you here!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Gaping like a goldfish you find yourself at a loss for words as the reptilian face of the police official glares at you with an intensity that makes your stomach start to flip-flop around. Swallowing and then opening your mouth to retort you find yourself freezing as a large orange and yellow hand slaps the four-armed lizard across the back of the head. 'Dan, didn't I tell you to stop harassing pedestrians?' A sleep eyed reptile, this one a mixture of a raptor and a komodo dragon, wearing a trench coat[if daytimer is day]and pair of shades over his face[else]with a pair of shades hanging onto the collar of his coat[end if] says while sighing long-sufferingly.[line break]";
		say "The officer, Dan, yelps and then grabs the sides of his head before turning to regard the other lizard. 'Greg, it was her! She was right here standing like she was waiting on this[if player is male]guy[else]person[end if]!' The four-armed officer points two of his hands in your direction while his others fly around somewhat wildly in the direction the blonde female just ran off to.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "At this the raptor lifts one eye ridge[if daytimer is day]and then reaches up to remove his shades[else]and then looks at you with a somewhat focused stare[end if]before glowering at you somewhat coldly. 'Is that true[if player is male]sir[else]ma'am[end if]? Was there a blonde woman here a moment ago and was she waiting on you?' The raptor looks at you with an unblinking mask of calm on his muzzle and you quickly get the feeling that you may have stepped in over your head. Is all of this really worth getting tangled up with the police over? (Y=yes, N=no)[line break]";
		if player consents:
			say "Remembering that Omio asked you to find this woman, and trusting in the redhead not to get you hurt, or else killed, you look the raptor hybrid dead in the face while schooling your features into the same impassive facade of calm. Telling the officers that you were just curious about the blonde haired woman you don't back down as the trench coat wearing raptor narrows his eyes at you. Behind the man you can hear his long serpentine tail lashing against the ground in rising frustration, but the raptor keeps his mask of tranquility placed firmly onto his face.";

			if charisma of player > 16:
				say "'Alright, then we have no choice but to believe you.' The four-armed iguana standing off to the side lets his mouth drop at hearing this. 'But, a word of warning -- just in case you happened to be lying -- stay away from that woman. She's nothing but trouble.' The other man turns to regard his flabbergasted partner and then chuckles humorously at the younger male's antics. 'Come on Dan. It's time to go and do our civil duty.' The larger hybrid takes the smaller four-armed male by one of his numerous arms and then drags the other off. 'B-b-but!!' Dan tries to say while looking back and forth between you and his obvious partner. 'Yes, yes. I know I have a nice butt. I'll let you ream me just as soon as we get back to our apartment,' the raptor says in a somewhat blasé manner while tugging at the uniformed reptile.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "At that Dan goes silent, which, interestingly enough, makes him somewhat easier for the raptor to dragon along. You take a few moments to go over what just happened in your head and then shrug when you find that none of that made any good sense. Maybe having a talk with Omio would be wise, but then again you still haven't gotten the package from off of the blonde for the redhead researcher. Given the raptor's words though, should you continue looking for the white coat wearing female, especially if she could turn out to be dangerous?[line break]";
			else:
				say "Trying to tell the officer that you don't know anything nets you a feral smirk from the raptor. 'If I said, [']I don't believe you['], would you take offense?' The raptor dark green-brown eyes grow hard as he says this and you feel a chill go across your spine. You suddenly sense that there's something [italic type]dangerous[roman type] about this man, but you're not sure what this feeling could be on about seeing as the other hasn't actually threatened you... yet. 'It's fine. If you say you don't know anything then I guess we have to believe you.' The four-armed iguana standing off to the side lets his mouth drop to the floor upon hearing this. 'However, if you just so happened to be lying to me, then do yourself a favor and take this piece of advice with you. Stay away from that woman - she's nothing but trouble.'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "The trench coat wearing reptile drops his scary visage in favor of his former sleepy one and then turns to regard his flabbergasted partner. 'Come on Dan. It's time to go and do our civil duty.' The larger hybrid takes the smaller four-armed male by one of his numerous arms and then begins to drag the other off. 'B-b-but!!' Dan tries to say while looking back and forth between you and his obvious partner. 'Yes, yes. I know I have a very nice butt. I'll let you ream me just as soon as we get back to our apartment,' the raptor says in a somewhat blasé manner while tugging at the uniformed reptile.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "At that Dan goes silent, which, interestingly enough, makes him somewhat easier for the raptor hybrid to dragon along behind him. You take a few moments to think about what just happened... and then have to shrug when you find that nothing that just happened made any kind of good sense. Maybe having a talk with Omio would be wise, but then again you still haven't gotten the package from off of the blonde for the redhead researcher. Given the raptor's words though, should you really continue looking for the white coat wearing female, especially if she could turn out to be dangerous?[line break]";
		else:
			say "Knowing that lying to police is not the right thing to do, and knowing that police brutality is not something uncommon in this and age and in this country, you let the raptor in on the fact that you were coming to pick up a package from the blonde for a friend. 'I... see.' The raptor is somewhat taken aback by your honesty and hums quietly into his throat before flicking his tongue out to taste the scent of the air around you. 'Well, that's... very interesting to know.' The other man backs up and then chuckles some before looking at the direction his partner is pointing. 'Let your arms down Dan. She's gone by now so we can't really do anything about it at the moment.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "'So what do we do about him, then?' The four-armed iguana asks while hiking a thumb at you. The older raptor looks at his partner, then at you, and then shrugs. 'Not much we can do. This model citizen was just going about his way doing a favor for someone. What can we do with? Book him for doing a friend a favor? That'd look nice on a report, which I assure you, I'd make you write up.' The iguana blanches at that and then seems to all but deflate. A chuckle from his partner has you turning your head between the two men to regard them curiously.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "'Trust me when I say this [if player is male]pal[else]miss[end if], you'll be wanting to stay far away from [']that woman[']. She's nothing but trouble.' And with that the raptor turns away from you and then grunts for his uniformed partner to follow after him as he starts to walk off. The iguana gives you a dirty look, but says nothing as he goes to follow after the older reptile. The last you see of the two are both of their tails swaying in time together as they head down the street.[line break]";
			say "You stand there for a moment in wonder about what just happened and then decide that maybe having a little talk with Omio would be wise. Then again, you haven't gotten the redhead's package as you said you would. Can you really return with a job half done? But with what the raptor just said is it really wise to go after the blonde woman, especially if she's [']dangerous[']? Decisions. Decisions.[line break]";

From the looks of things though, the blonde seems to be in no need of assistance as she weaves around the small group of four trying to get at her while brandishing a gleaming pair of curved blades with no small amount of skill. Taking a moment to watch the fight play out, after realizing that your help would be more of a detriment than an assistance, you track the blonde's movements as she all but dances around the lustful mutates.";

You look to the grunting and groaning figures lying prone on the ground and then chuckle reverently at the ass whoppin' they just received. Seeing that there's nothing more to see here you turn to move off about your way.

Grunting from the impact of your two bodies colliding you stagger for a moment before catching yourself. Once you are settled you look to find the face of the four-armed iguana from before gazing up at you with a slightly punch-drunk look plastered onto his scaly face. 'Hey! I know you!' The bleary eyed reptile slurs while blinking owlishly up at you. 'You're that suspect I'm supposed to question!' The uniformed iguana chuckles playfully before grabbing you into a strong bear hug and then nuzzling the underside of your [face of player] neck.";

'I'm so happy I found you, now I can tell Greg that I did a good job and get a pat on the head from him.' At this point you're about totally lost, but seeing how inebriated the other is you start to open your mouth to ask the cop a question. However, before you can several rugged looking mutants come out of the building the iguana had just flown from with angry looks plastered onto their muzzles.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "The group of five quickly surround you and your drunken companion and then go to growling and hissing like mad which makes you narrow your eyes. 'H-hey, back off you guys. I-I'ma police officer!' the iguana says, but that only makes the rowdy looking group of mutants start to chuckle as some of them begin to leer at the vulnerable reptile. 'We know, we've been looking to do our civic duty for a while now, haven't we guys?' The rest of the mutants all nod together while rubbing their growing hard ons. 'Why don't you leave the lizard here, friend? We'll take [italic type]real[roman type] good care of this lightweight.'";

While they don't look like they'd kill him, after what the group might put him through you're not sure the [italic type]iguana[roman type] will remain an iguana once the assembled males surrounding you both get finished with his ass and tail. But is putting yourself at risk for an unknown stranger really worth the trouble?";

Easy to see that a badge and a uniform do not make one invincible, even when drunk, as the reptile shivers while hugging himself closer into you. Looking around for the other's partner you wonder where in the hell the raptor hybrid could be. 'Well, what's it gonna be? You handing him over or not?' The lead mutant questions, somewhat irately.";

'If that's the case then you need to keep [italic type]your[roman type] sluts out of our bar, unless you want them cream filled after the boys and I get through with them.' Huffing and saying [']whatever['] you wave the group off. Watching carefully as the assembled grumbles and then goes about their way back into the bar you let out a sigh of relief when the door to the place slams shut behind the last one.";

Letting the reptile know that he isn't that bad since he's an officer and all you begin to get some of the lizard's life story, completely without haven been asked for it. 'Greg's the one who got me signed up for the Academy. He's the one who encouraged me to keep on even when the other cops found out I was a [']fag['] and started to harass me about it.' The iguana shivers much harder and then starts to sob openly. 'He's the one who found me when the other guys were raping me and had me tied up in that basement. If it wasn't for him... I... I...'";

You barely notice how much time passes as you just stand there with the whimpering reptile. When someone comes up to tap you gently onto the shoulder you feel your spine lock up as you think that you're about to be attacked, however, upon hastily being freed from your four arm embrace you realize than an impending assault is not in the future. 'Greg!'";

The cop points with his tail and the raptor simply tips his head up to regard the building before turning his head down to look over his partner. 'S-she was in there, giving something to the bartender. When I tried to meet her head-on all the guys in the bar started to get riled up for some reason. When I tried to catch her one of the guys grabbed me and then forced something down my throat.

T-they... they were probably going to rape me if...' A growl from Greg shuts down whatever Dan was going to say. 'I see, well you have my thanks... whoever you are.' You give the bigger raptor your name and then tell him it was no problem. 'No it was a problem - a problem that shouldn't have happened in the first place. Dan, you are going to have to learn how to stay with me instead of always following your detective instincts.";

'Because there's something I need from that woman.' The raptor hybrid whispers into his partner's ear, yet you are unable to hear it from your vantage point.[line break]";

The blue scaled male takes two steps back from you and then waits for you to get up off of your knees, or so you would assume by his sudden non-aggressive attitude.";
