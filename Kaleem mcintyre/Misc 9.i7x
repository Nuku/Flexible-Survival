to say ResolveEvent Clotho:
	say "     'Hold on! Don't move! Just stay right where you are!' It's the volume of the words being spoken that stops you more than the words themselves. Not knowing what's happening, you freeze in place and look around to see what the hoopla is on about. What you find is a very... unusual human looking woman coming over to you and then trying to pull you out of your clothes. Not really understanding you wave the woman, who is less [']human['] than you had thought as she possesses two fluffy cat ears atop her head and a silver chain with an emblem of some kind of cat insignia embroidered into the front of a pendant hanging onto the chain itself, off as best you can. 'Oh will you stop moving around so much? I'm trying to get you out of these clothes so I can take your measurements.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Asking the other woman who she is nets you a grumpy growl from the other. 'My name's not as important as the fact that I have something I need to make for you. Now hold still.' Not sure you find yourself letting the other woman do as she pleases, which ultimately nets you being stripped, measured, fondled in certain places you really don't want to be, and finally allowed to put back on your clothes after about an hour's time. 'As I thought, you are exactly what I need. [bold type]Atropis[roman type] back at our [bold type]high rise[roman type] condo is going to be so stoked about this!' The feline eared woman squeals and then rushes off like a shot, leaving you thoroughly confused.";

to say ResolveEvent Atropis:
	say "     When something small but speedy knocks against your chest, you blink in surprise. Looking, you find a small kitten girl blinking up to you with very wide jade eyes. Smiling and then helping the other to stand on her own, you ask if she's lost before getting a quick shake of the head.";
	say "     Feeling somewhat like you should do something for the kitten, you reach back behind you to fish out some provisions from inside of your pack. Graciously you offer what you have to the small feline who hesitantly takes it with a small, unsure upturn of her lips. After telling the other to be more careful next time you then offer to take her back home. 'No thank you. My big sister is on her way to get me.' Raising your head to look around the area you give the kitten, who is now munching on the food you just gave her, a curious look.";
	say "     Just as you are about to ask the little one if she's sure, a cough from behind you makes you turn your head back. What you find at your back just so happens to be a buxom looking panther woman dressed in a flowing black gown staring you down with a cocksure grin onto her stunning feline face. 'She's sure because I'm right here, darling.' In front of you the little kitten meows happily as she runs around your left side to rush over to the much taller black cat. 'I appreciate you trying to look out for Lachesis here, but it's not necessary.' Gaping slightly you cautiously nod to the unnamed panthress.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Watching as the little kitten hugs herself into her [']sister's['] leg, you try not to let your mind wander as you look between the two in astonishment. Not having a reason to doubt the sincerity of the panthress though, especially when the younger feline begins to talk animatedly you to older female, you prepare to head off on your way without a word. However, before you can you find yourself being stopped when the woman grunts into her throat again.";
	say "     'Clotho wanted me to give you this.' The panthress then hands you a pink box wrapped up in silver string. Hesitantly thanking the other for the gift you ask her who Clotho is. 'My other little sister.' And with that the panthress turns to walk away with the little kitten standing next to her following at her side. Before the two are get too far away you watch as the feline in black takes the kitten's hand, something to which the smaller feline beams in joy over.";
	say "     Not sure what that was on about, you reach up to scratch at your head before shrugging all the same. Just as you are about to move yourself along you find nearly dropping the pink box in between your hands, having almost completely forgotten about the thing. Moving your [BodySpeciesName of Player in lower case] fingers over the silver twine keeping the package closed you remove the material, open the container... and then blush hotly as you find yourself looking at a stunningly beautiful silver dress looking back up at you. A single card with your name, height and other measurements written down onto the front is the only proof that this piece of apparel is really meant for you.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     But why in hell's bells would someone...? Not sure, you don't bother to think on it long as you simply slam the top back over the box and then head on your way. Meanwhile, somewhere far away, three sisters are cracking up at a joke they're sharing right about now.";
