The person holding you up, who just so happens to be a Dalmatian, asks with their dark brown eyes shining at you somewhat playfully.";

The man wearing the blue, firefighter-embroidered shirt takes a step back from you, yet in spite of this you give the Dalmatian the rundown of what's happening and who you just so happen to be. Watching the canine's face go through a multitude of expression before stilling on surprise, you can bet that he never imagined hearing this information when he woke up today.";

Heh, if you wouldn't mind I've got some things to think over while I finish up my run so...' Asking the anthro if he's going back to the fire station, you get a slow nod from him. 'Y-yeah, I just, have some things to finish up back home so after I deal with that, I'll head on over there a little later.' With a slow lick over the end of his muzzle, the firefighter looks at you and then moves past you to go off about his way. Faintly, you realize that it's almost as if he's trying to run away from you.";

Once there, you quietly move through the hallway until you find the doorway marked with the numbers 319. Remembering that this is where one of the missing firefighters was [']supposed['] to be living at, you knock on the door three times and then wait. As the wood barrier creaks open, ever so slightly, you find yourself nervously taking a step back when a voice seeps through the small crack of the doorway. 'Can I help you?";

'Yes, but... who are you?' The door opens a little more and you can faintly see a splash of black on white as a long snout peeks out. Informing the man know that you are friends with Kenaz, and that you are trying to find his coworkers, you watch as the door opens just a little more. What you see slightly amazes you as you find yourself looking into the fully transformed face of a Dalmatian mutant currently staring back at you somewhat unsurely.";

When the door opens fully, you can only watch in awe as a naked and half aroused Dalmatian male nervously squirms around in place while looking at you somewhat confusedly. 'The name's Dagaz. I know, strange as hell, but my sire was a weirdo like that.' [']Dagaz['] can only shrug as he timidly smiles at you.";
		say "     Not sure what to say at this point, as you really hadn't thought up anything after the initial [italic type]rescue[roman type] effort had been completed. So, on a whim, you ask the anthro man how he's doing. 'Oh, fine as can be. I've been hiding in my uncle's pad while trying to wait this whole thing out. [if findwires is 2 and fixedgens > 2]With the power back on I've been able to get the radio and TV working so I've been somewhat okay[else]Without any power I've just been trying to find ways to cure my boredom[end if].

I'm surprised about that with the city the way it is. What did he turn into?' The question is both honest and a little pointed, as though the anthro man is somewhat envious over something. When you let him know that Kenaz is still, roughly, 98% human, Dagaz is quick to growl in anger. 'Lucky bastard! He would be the one that gets to keep his skin while I...' A bitten off cough ends the rant before it could begin.";
		say "     'You know what, let me stop. Tell Kenaz that I'll be around later to check on things.' The Dal man takes a step to turn around but before he can get too far, you spot something on the firefighter's rump. From the shape and look of it, you can only guess that it's a... but that couldn't be right. Opening your mouth to ask Dagaz about it, you get a sharp rebuke from the Dalmatian after he turns to glare at you. 'That's none of your business!' Dagaz's shout makes you jump back slightly. 'Look, I'm grateful and all for coming to look for us and whatever, but you need to mind your own business and keep out of mine.' And with that, Dagaz pulls himself fully into his current residence and then loudly slams the door in your face.";

If you didn't know any better, you could almost swear that the anthro man is hiding something[end if]. Dagaz looked as though something was bothering him... and that mark on his butt... it kind of looked like a brand or something...

Not exactly sure what's going on, you press your ear to the door. The sound of something hard smacking into flesh and another sharp cry has you pulling back in confusion. When Dagaz's voice howls out in agony, you find yourself backing up to charge the door in an effort to force it open without thought on what could be on the other side.";
		say "     The fact that the door wasn't exactly locked makes your entrance somewhat haphazardous as you windup tumbling into the room with all the grace of a duck trying to break dance. Grunting when your knees meet the carpet, you shake your head and then look up in indignation, only to blink in confusion as you spy Dagaz hanging from his ceiling in a sling between several burly looking creatures. Of the six present, from what a quick head count informs you of their numbers, three of the mutants are hyenas, two are demons and one is something that you're not really sure about. The fact that five out of six of them have some very [']interesting['] weaponry in their hands has you raising an eye ridge ever so slowly as you silently wonder what kind of party you just stumbled onto.";

The fact that there are numerous candles around the apartment, glowing almost dimly in the darkness of the condo, makes this entire setting somewhat... eerie, if not all out creepy. In any other given situation, you're sure that you might have started to freak out, however, now you're just too worried about Dagaz to find the energy to be frightened.";
		say "     Coughing nervously, you try to call out for the firefighter to grab his attention. Sadly, Dagaz's only answer comes in the form of a dull whimper as the Dalmatian lolls his head around almost drunkenly while hovering across the floor in the sling. 'This here is our little playmate, friend. Step off and get out before you find yourself in a world of hurt,' the unknown mutant says somewhat unrepentantly as he looks to you with bored, luminescent green-blue eyes. Picking yourself up off the ground, you completely ignore the anthro as you try to call out to Dagaz once again to ask him if he's alright. The Dalmatian simply whimpers at you before turning his head in shame. He sounds like he's hurting, but... not quite.";

'Dagaz here is our little playmate of the hour. He belongs to us, both body and mind, because of a contract he signed between the two of us. As such, he's ours to do with as we please. Now, if that answers your question... Get. Out.' Looking to the shuddering Dalmatian and then to the assorted group, you weigh your options.

The unknown mutant seems to silently ponder over something while slyly narrowing his eyes at you. When you take a step towards the canine, he is quick to back away from you. 'C-calm down.' A quick wave of a hand has you stopping your forward pursuit towards the man. 'I think it's about time that I ended this contract with Dagaz anyway. It's almost expired and he hasn't made a move to renew it as of yet.' The well-dressed mutant sighs before snapping his fingers, which causes the assembled creatures you just defeated to spring up and then head for the door. Didn't you just beat them into submission not more than ten minutes ago?";
									say "     'Just so you know, Dagaz here made a contract with our company for the current services that he's being treated to. So, don't think we were doing this out of malice or spite,' the mutant explains, and you have to ask him what he's on about. 'Well, you see, currently the company I work for takes on BDSM contracts and then work with the client, or clients, in question to bring about their wild little fantasies. With the city the way it is now, we are hoping to open a branch here in order to expand further out to this side of the country. Dagaz was to be our first customer in this region and has been taken care of quite well... until tonight that is.' You don't show any apology for having trounced the canine as you stand somewhat defiantly in front of the unknown mutant.";

'Next time you make a contract...[italic type]tell your friends[roman type] before they show up to trounce my guys! My company is not in the habit of dealing with domestic disturbances and little happenings like this will get you banned from our patron's list if this should ever happen again, understand?' Dagaz can only moan as he nod his head while seeming to slip in and out of consciousness. 'Ugh... the things I have to go through.' The mutant shakes his head before moving past you on his way out the door. When you call him back to ask about the sling...";
									say "     'It came with the Dalmatian so I'll leave you to figure out how to get him down.' And then the man is gone. Not sure what to do next in this situation, you go over to the whimpering Dalmatian and then have a look at him. From what you can see, other than some fur ripped out of place and some marks littered along his pinkish skin, the firefighter is just fine. Maybe you got here before the real action could begin?";
									say "     Patting the Dalmatian on the cheek to get his attention, you try and ask Dagaz how to get him down from this weird thing. 'Please... just leave me alone. Gods, this is so embarrassing!' Obviously, the anthro is more than just a little okay if he can grumble and bemoan the way he is doing right now. Trying to tell him that you don't care about his strange hobbies and you just wanted to make sure he is alright, you find the Dalmatian whimpering up at you in complete shame. 'Please... just go away. Can't you see that you ruined everything? Those guys were just about to...' A shudder halts whatever Dagaz was about to say as the Dalmatian unexpectedly lets out a carnal snarl of both want and need.";
									WaitLineBreak;

From the bubbles of pre at the head of the tapered tip, it would seem that the Dalmatian is but seconds away from popping his load. Seeing this and looking around the room at the paddles and whips that had been left behind on the floor, you wonder if you should try and finish up what the others started?";

Judging the weight to be more than enough to [']get the job done['], you walk back over to the now shivering Dalmatian who just so happens to be watching you intently. No words are spoken as Dagaz simply stares at you and then gives you a pleading whimper before letting his head fall back to hang limply in the air. Chuckling at the firefighter, you reach out to feel the downy fur of Dagaz's belly and arms before running your hand down to pat at his tight rump. A wag of the Dalmatian's thin tail has you smirking as you wonder where you should begin working the anthro over at first.";
										say "     Realizing that it doesn't matter, you pull the paddle back and then strike out across the first available area that seems most vulnerable. A loud crack has the canine man yowling as he jerks like crazy inside of the sling. The hit must have done something extra special to him because the firefighter's cock is now spouting small strings of precum across his ivory and black spotted belly. Noting this, you move to strike out at the guy again - this time across the Dalmatian's thigh. Another yowl has you almost laughing as you watch Dagaz flail around in his sling, looking almost as if he were trying to get away, however, you know better than that.";

When your fourth strike lights a bolt of pain across the outer edge of the firefighter's right butt cheek, Dagaz is nearly howling his praise, or maybe submission, to the night sky outside as he shudders and shakes while humping his cock up at nothing. The red, tapered mass of flesh is now leaking pre almost like a broke water fountain, and from both the smell and then look of the gooey mess dripping onto the hardwood floor, you can tell it won't be long now.";

										say "     Hitting the Dalmatian over and over with the paddle - up over his left pectoral muscle, down across his arm, up over his torso and then across his other butt cheek - you beat the anthro man until Dagaz is soon nothing more than a yowling mess of fur, sweat and free flowing precum. Looking at the Dalmatian's pulsating cock, you don't fight the perverted smirk that creeps onto your lips as you watch the bulb of the spotted canine's knot swelling up to its full girth. Turning your head to look to the paddle in your hands, you chuckle before lifting your eyes to look intently up at Dagaz's whimpering form.";

Dagaz looks up at you in both wonder and adoration as he tries to ask with his eyes rather than his mouth, since the latter is babbling nothing more unintelligent gibberish right about now. You nod to the Dalmatian and then... [italic type]CRACK[roman type]. The howl that follows is so loud that you can actually start to hear people banging and shouting from all directions around you. However, you really don't get a flying fuck about the others as you are too focused on watching thick ribbons of Dalmatian spooge shooting up through the air as the firefighter literally cums with the force of a tidal wave.";

The shower has to last for almost a full minute, but once it's over, Dagaz literally falls limp into the sling. Passed clean out from that powerful climax, you find yourself somewhat abashed to realize that you enjoyed playing with the canine male in such a delightfully ruthless sort of way. Reaching out to rub some of the cum into the Dalmatian's fur, you run your fingers over and across Dagaz's snout, coating his nose and lips with his own cum, before you toss the paddle off to the side.";

Not really sure of what's going on, the Dalmatian tries to stand himself up only to stop when he feels something, very hard and very unforgiving hampering his attempts. Turning to look at his back, after he rolls himself over onto his stomach, the Dalmatian gasps as he observes the end of a familiar looking wooden paddle stuffed up into his tailhole. Gaping in confusion, it takes the Dalmatian maybe a full three minutes to recall what happened last night, but when all of his memories return, the firefighter can only whimper and groan as he blushes furiously while wagging his thin whip of a tail back behind him like mad.";

When you encircle your fingers around the firefighter's knot, Dagaz can only yelp as the stimulation of a mock tie causes him to jerk and then fire off his load. The fact that you have aimed Dagaz's tapered tip back at his face only serves to make the Dalmatian orgasm both messy and exciting as you watch the firefighter splatter his muzzle with his own sticky yellowish-white load.
