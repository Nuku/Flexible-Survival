to say ResolveEvent Defenseless Old Lady:
	say "     Making your way down the street, you happen to come across little old lady making her way in the opposite direction that you are going. Thinking that what you are seeing is a mirage, it has to be for a normal HUMAN woman to be walking around untainted by the infections, let's not mention the mutations roaming around, you blink several times to dispel the image from your obviously tired mind. When that fails to work, you find yourself moving on hurried feet over to where the older woman is, concern for her safety gripping your heart as you wonder over the why, how, and what the hell is she doing out here, by herself no less. Upon hearing your panicked footsteps the older woman stops and then turns her bespectacled face in your direction, curious to know what the fuss is all about. Before you can think about asking the older woman a single question you find that, just as you had feared, a number of mutants are making their way towards your and the older woman's direction. Whipping your head around to try and find some cover you barely have time to survey the area around you even halfway before the mutants see you and then begin to race towards you. By the looks on their faces, muzzles, and snouts some of them eager to see you, but not in any platonic sort of way as more than half of the assemble group having cocks dripping and mouths salivating in raw want to have your ass. Literally. However, despite this truth the sheer need to protect this woman overcomes your senses and before the assemble ground is half way towards the both of you, you position yourself in front of your charge so as to shield her from the would be attackers.";

		say "As though possessed by the spirit of war, you find yourself knocking out each of your opponents one after another with both strength and skill you didn't even know you had. Even though some of them are bigger and stronger and sturdier than you that doesn't seem to matter as you're fueled with the need to protect this harmless little old woman. The pink dress wearing bespectacled older woman smiles happily as she watches you spectacularly kick the asses of all those assembled as you send the mutants scurrying off to... wherever they had come from. Once the last of them are gone, there were only eight in total, you pant harshly before dropping down onto the ground. Now that the adrenaline high is gone your body seems to quiver as you get the shakes throughout your arms and legs. Taking a second to breathe calmly you mentally pat yourself on the back for having the strength and resolve to win that fight. Reaching up to wipe the sweat from your brow you turn to look at the older woman just in time to see a grizzled hand reaching forward to hand you two bottles of water and some chips. You smile gratefully to the woman, both glad to know she's alright and for the items in question, but try and shake your head as you don't want to take anything from her. Given that what she has is so precious in this harsh land that bears little you don't have the heart to take from her, but a stern look from her has you doing so anyway. Suddenly feel like you're dealing with your own grandmother when she's in her giving mood.";
		say "     You take the offering with good measure and then shakily get up onto your feet. Once you've done that, the effort it takes having made you somewhat dizzy, you open your mouth to ask the woman where she lives and how she's survived without being infected, only to snap your yap shut when she pulls out an automatic rifle from somewhere underneath her dress. Your eyes stare at the powerful weapon in both horror and disbelief, the thing had to have be taller than the woman was long, not to mention a great deal heavier by the looks of the polished metal, and yet here she was wielding it with practiced ease. Slinging the gun onto her back the woman gives you a knowing wink before hobbling her way down the street like she wasn't carrying heavy artillery on her. Just as she makes it halfway down the road you notice several canisters of pepper spray hiding around the older woman's ankle, a stray breeze having pulled them hem of her dress forward and up just a ways. Part of you wants to follow her to make sure she makes it home safely, but the other part is just too afraid. Where in the world had she gotten that stuff from, you silently ask yourself. But then you decide, you might be better off not knowing.";

	else:
		say "A few punches and kicks and - interestingly enough - a dozen or so licks later you find yourself lying defeated onto the ground. The punches and kicks start turning to squeezes and gropes as your resistance starts to wane and the creatures pin you down. Your strength having failed you at one of the most integral of times in life all you can do is open your mouth to try and tell the old woman to run for it, but a stern look on the other human's face has you shutting your yap before you can even utter a sound. Seeing that some of the mutants are now moving away from you towards the bespectacled woman you can only watch with wide eyes as she pulls out an automatic rifle from somewhere on her person and then lets the creature's around you have it but good! Screams, yowls, hisses, cries and shouts of pain rent the air around you only to be followed by blood, guts and other assorted fluids flying throughout the air as the little old woman with the heavy piece of artillery lays waste to all of the miscreants surrounding you. You duck your head down into your arms just as you see an arm go flying off to the side. This... this may a touch too violent for you to take as you start to feel nausea rolling throughout your stomach. It's only when you can no longer hear the sounds of bullets being fired that you take a peek up to have a look around. And quickly you wish you hadn't. Strewn around like leaves after a storm you see faces and legs and other limbs scattered around you in a grisly display of murder and violence.";
		say "     However, soon the vision is replaced by a slightly shriveled hand reaching out to you to give you aid from off the ground. Turning your head so fast that you nearly give yourself whiplash, you find your gaze going up pass the wrinkled hand to the older woman smiling down at you as though you were her long lost grandchild. Smiling nervously, you shakily get up onto your knees, but only after taking the offered hand - no sense upsetting the little woman by being prideful, right? A sense of wonder does come over you though as you marvel when the old woman hefts your greater weight up as though you were a sack of potatoes before dusting you off with her unoccupied hand. Blinking at the incredulity of the situation you try to form words to voice your feelings, but find yourself silenced by a bright smile coming off of the older lady. Reaching down to pull up the hem of her pink dress the little old lady hands you two cans of pepper spray and then pats you on the shoulder before going off onto her way. You could have almost sworn that your eyes faintly caught the sight of silver dog tags shimmering around her neck, but you there is just no way she could be a...or could she? With the automatic rifle she has in hand still smoking lightly from out of the muzzle you playfully wonder if maybe you need to ask her for protection instead of the other way around. However, before you can weigh the pros and cons of this you realize that you are still standing along in the middle of a street covered with enough gore to make you still want to throw up. Thinking better than to stick around and become another target, you hightail it down the street to somewhere much safer, though not without wondering where that older woman got her weaponry from.";
