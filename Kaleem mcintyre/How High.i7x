Instead of resolving a How High:
	say "Making your way throughout the park area you find yourself coming across a very strange, if not somewhat arousing sight. There in the middle of a small glen surrounded by trees on all side with bushes dotted in between said trees, there sit several mutant stallions all conversing with one another while passing something between each other. While what you see doesn't exactly look like a cigarette, it's much longer than that, not to mention much wider, you do see that the item in question is smoking slightly as a long length of white trails up into the sky. Taking a sniff of the air you find yourself sneezing somewhat as a weird musky scent cloys at your nose with a... strangely... revitalizing sort of smell. Right away you can feel your body start to shiver as your back arches while down below your legs quiver as though they are made of jelly. It takes you a full minute to shake off the effects of the obvious intoxicant that the stud horses, as you don't see any fillies around the small group, are passing between one another. Not really sure how you feel about mutants getting high in the middle of the park, you don't have long to think over the moral aspects of your feelings before one of the equines, a pitch black stallion with enough muscles on him to make a professional bodybuilder feel envious, raises his head to spot you. Like a child with their hand in the proverbial cookie jar, you find yourself freezing as pitch black eyes look upon you with a carefully guarded stare.";
	say "A few seconds of silence pass between you both before you notice that all seven of the gathered studs are looking at you as you stand there with your mouth slightly hung open. It's only when the black stallion waves you over that you wonder if you should run for the hills, as going over to a bunch of naked and virile looking mutants equines does not seem like a particularly smart thing to do, especially since most of them have a slightly buzzed look in their eyes. But then again, if they had wanted your ass wouldn't they have already been moving to try and catch you? Obviously these stallions have more than half of their humanity left within them, so is there really that much of a risk in just going over to speak with them?";
	say "     [bold type]To head over or run, that is the question.[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Head over.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Run.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "Deciding that you have nothing to lose, save maybe some more of your already waning humanity, you carefully stroll over to the assembled group of studs. Mind screaming out a warning for you to be careful, you ready yourself to bolt if any of the stallions so much as neighs at you the wrong way. Once you are close enough to them to smell the collected group you find your nose quivering somewhat from the stale musky scent of unwashed horse bodies, testosterone, the intoxicant being passed around once again, cum and breath all intermingling together in a pleasantly subtle sort of way. A strange form of relaxation begins to take over your mind as you start to think of just how beautiful the collection of stable studs are with those rippling equine bodies, long and flowing manes, not to mention their wiry smiles painted across their colorful muzzles as they stare at you calculatingly. Being waved over to come sit by the big black male that had dominated your focus earlier, you find your feet taking you over to the friendly looking horse and then plop yourself down on the soft grass next to him without having to be told twice.";
		say "Mildly take notice as the rest of the stallions start to speak to you, cheering you on for having the guts to enter into the [italic type]herd[roman type], however, most of your entire attention is taken up by the captivating stallion whose thick left arm has come around your side to pull you bodily against him. Blushing and shaking your head, almost like a feral horse tousling its mane, you find yourself speaking without thought as you introduce yourself to the seven males. The assorted equine each introduce themselves in turn, giving names and ages and former residencies as well as relationship statuses, and you find yourself marveling when six out of the seven present lay claim to the stallion stud next to them as being their boyfriend. The only one who doesn't is the big black stallion that had waved you down earlier. Could that mean that none of these studs belongs to the massive black horse, or vice versa? And if so you have to ask yourself, somewhat abashedly, why that thought makes you happy somewhere deep down into the pit of your stomach.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "The conversation soon goes from introductions to detailing how everyone came to be as they were now, with most of the studs having the same exact story. While taking some time off from their studies/jobs/parents, respectively, the assembled horse anthros had found themselves coming to the park to try and chill out for the day when they suddenly ended up transforming into stud horses out of the blue. Since most of them were cool with their transformations, especially given than almost half were lacking in the muscle category beforehand, they each accepted their changes with relish and ended up bonding after everyone stumbled over each other. After asking what they've been doing since the [italic type]epidemic[roman type] became full blown you find yourself somewhat confused when everyone begins laughing together as though sharing a private joke, which they probably were. 'Chilling man. Just chilling,' one of the studs says and quickly eyes your whip around to look at a black spotted and gray horse cuddling up to his taller lover, a dark brown stallion who was currently puffing on the end of the pipe they're all sharing.";
		say "Giving a nod you can't find fault in their logic and proceed to go on about how everyone has been handling the power out and lack of water. The group tells you that there is a small watering hole in the park that everyone here has been hording over to use as drinking water. When you go to ask them what they're smoking on...the faces of the group seem to light up all of a sudden. A round of devious smiles pass through the group and quickly you find yourself getting the pipe shoved into your hands. 'Hit this and you'll see.' Looking at the pipe with bleary eyes you can't help but blink as you find that your vision is distorting slightly from the contact you're getting just by being so close to the smoking item. Somewhat hesitantly you find yourself easing the tube away from yourself, the sudden feeling of danger radiating strongly within your mind. A gentle whicker from the black silences your fear however, as you look up to see the muscular stallion nodding at you imploringly. While there is no outright demand in the other's eyes you feel as though taking a hit might score you some points with the majestic horse holding you tightly.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "You outright ask the other if you can trust him and a slow bob of the equine's head tells you all you need to know. While your mind might be a bit frazzled you still have enough of your cognitive sense to know if someone was lying to you or not and from what you're picking up from this stud, he's neither lying to you nor would he let you come into danger. Turning your head to regard the group collected together you notice that all of the equines present are smiling at you with reassuringly. Looking down at the pipe, up at the stallions and then back down again you sigh before bringing the slightly wet end of the pipe to your lips to suck the intoxicant into your lungs.";
		say "Instantly you wish you hadn't taken the hit as whatever substance is in the bowl of the pipe has you panting and then choking as you inhale the stuff directly into your lungs. A strong, but careful hand reaches back to pat you on the back as you try and expel the cloud of smoke. When your coughs finally end you instantly pass the pipe along down the circle and then whinny in annoyance at the group. It's only after you realize what you've just done that you stop and blink in silent horror. Snapping your head up to look at the group in horror most of them are cheering for you while whickering and neighing with pride at what you've just accomplished. 'I take it you're not used to powdered charger, but that's okay. Most of us weren't before we took our first hit.' One of the studs, a chocolate horse with a white mane snorts before inhaling the end of the pipe in between his lips.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "When the other pulls back the tube from you find yourself asking what powdered charger is as you are sure you've never heard of that kind of tobacco before. 'Dude, what else would it be other than dried horse cum mixed with marijuana?' You blink as you are sure that you've just heard wrong. There's just no way... 'Hey, don't freak out, man.' A dust red equine says while holding up his meaty hands imploringly, his boyfriend now puffing on the tube the herd is sharing. 'This was the only thing we could use to get a buzz with since most of the stores got looted around here and most of the tobacco is gone.' You have to actually wonder how anyone could process wet cum into a dry powder, but after a second you are suddenly feeling too good to care as you notice that the world seems much more...wonderful all of a sudden. A dopey grin plasters itself onto your face as you chuckle and then laugh shyly for some reason.";
		say "A knowing smirk passes through the seven studs and instantly they're talking and whickering and neighing more liberally while passing the pipe down the circle around them. You watch with unfocused eyes as the studs keep passing the thing on down through them one by one by one until, finally, it gets back to you. Taking the tube in hand and then bringing it to your lips you have to pause as you hear the big black stud next to you whisper for you to puff and then inhale and then hold the smoke into your lungs before releasing it. Taking the sagely advice of the other still holding you close you proceed to do just that. The second time around feels so much better than the first as the smoke warms your lungs and chest right before you exhale the smoke out from your slightly elongated lips. Minutes pass as the pipe gets handed off again and again, being refilled by a large satchel that stand silently off onto the side of the pitch black male hugging you tight, and before you know it you're neighing and laughing and rubbing up against the big black stud wantonly. The other seems to enjoy your affections as soon he is rubbing and touching you all over while whinnying softly into your ears. It doesn't take long for the others to break the circle as they back off from out of the circle as their herd leader's sheath begins to fill openly with the awakening length of his cock.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Seeing that the bigger male has found a mate to rut with the other six studs move away, after the dust red horse sets the pipe aside well out of the way of danger, and then move to grope and pinch at one another just as more sheaths start to bulge with the proof of oncoming arousal. It doesn't take long before submissive partners are placed gently onto the ground only to have their legs raised up into the air as firm rumps get onto display. The orgy that follows is of little concern to you because presently you and your black stallion are lost into each other as the muscular stallion strips you out of your clothes and then bends you in half, with your back pressed flush onto the ground, as he surveys your pert rump cheeks. A whicker of glee shoots through you both as the herd leader is soon pressing his long muzzle into your nethers, nuzzling you at the same time as he's taking in your changing scent.";
		say "Panting and groaning in growing abandon you try not to yell out to the sky when the stallion starts to lick you in between the split of your ass with his dexterous tongue. The firm organ seems to know what it's doing as it pokes into your clenched muscles and then delves straight inside of your rectum. Without getting much resistance from your more than willing body, you are soon neighing to the sky above as your puckered hole is drenched in warn equine drool. Clenching at the grass you yelp and then keen before spreading your legs open as wide as you can manage. The want to give your stud access to the deepest part of you making your sense go haywire as the horse's infected saliva pours through you like molten fire. The black beauty seems to appreciate your efforts as he quickly bobs his tongue back and forth all the way up through you as he prepares your ass to take his girth. Had you not been clenching your eyes at the moment you might have been able to see the wide flare at the head of the stallion's tube steak creep out from the stud's sheath. Though, that may be a blessing in and of itself as the sight of the massive four inch wide organ might have raised a slight bit of fear in you for your ass...literally speaking.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "However, when the anthro equine runs his heated tongue along your prostate you find yourself not caring about any further consequential prospects as drool begins to dribble down the side of your mouth. Begging for your stallion mate to breed you, your voice soon begins to crack with the sounds of needy whinnies as you open yourself fully to your lover's dominant affections. The black horse is glad to give you what you desire as he slowly pulls his nose from in between your cheeks, carries his full body up over you so that he can position his rod at your loosened pucker and then gently slides himself into your warm and lubricated depths with a smooth and polished thrust of his massive hips. The feel of having such a big rod slipping inside of you makes your eyes roll up into your head as pure sensual fire courses throughout your spine only to flow outwards into every part of your body as you come alive with the desire to be fucked.";
		say "The black stallion is quick to murmur quiet reassurances down to you as he shuffles his knees forward into your upturned rear while digging his fingers into the grass around the both of you. It takes half a minute before the other is completely buried into your flush and sweating body and then another half a minute before he's confident that he can move inside of you without tearing something. Once the equine does however, you find your world quickly narrowing itself down to a single point as you relax yourself completely for the shaft hammering itself into your rectum with the force of a charging battering ram. Grunting and hissing as your body gets a steady and thorough work out you try not to pay attention to it as your body slowly takes on the shape of a stud horse. Focusing on the pleasure while blocking out the pain of your metamorphosis you find yourself listening to the surrounding sexual symphony playing out around you as your ears pull up and then flicker as they become equine in fashion.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Gritting your teeth as your stud slams into your ass just a little harder you pull your head down to look where the two of you are connected just in time to see the fifteen inch cock of the black horse slip itself out of you before thrusting back into the tunnel of your new tailhole. The audible slaps of the bigger male's balls careening into your lower body make you blush somewhat as you wonder just how much cum is inside of those heavy orbs. Your answer comes in the next ten minutes as the black equine rears up and then whinnies loudly into the air as he humps you powerfully once and then twice before inseminating your guts with his load. Without fail your stud's cum rushes into your body, bloating your stomach as gallon after gallon of equine spooge finds a new home inside of your stomach, just in time for you to howl as your own orgasm racks through you.";
		if player is male:
			say "Your own male shaft twitches and then shudders before spouting out globs of cum onto your and your stud's chests. A shiver of pleasure makes you nearly weak in the knees, a moot point since said knees are being held up by the arms of your stallion lover, and you wonder if this is what euphoria feels like as wave after wave of pleasure fills you to the brim. Grunting and then flexing your inner muscles you make sure to let the herd leader know that his efforts are much appreciated as you milk him for the last of his creamy ejaculations. A whicker from the black equine make you chuckle some as you know that your stud appreciates this very much, especially if the quick thrust into your already tender ass is anything to go by.";
		else:
			say "You can only moan as you give yourself over to your stud in both body and maybe a little bit of soul as his infection runs rampant throughout you. You wonder what it would be like for you to have a male sex, the likes of which could shoot your own cum up in gratefulness of the black stallion creaming himself inside of you, but you quickly push that thought away as you tighten your inner rectal muscles around the other. You may not be a stud horse as of yet, but you damn well know how to make this stallion moan as you grip his cock in a vice-like hold. A grateful whinny comes from the black stallion and a shy smile covers your face as you feel your lover hump forward into you three good times before growing still again.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Once your stud is finished with you instead of pulling out he actually pushes forward more as he wraps his arms around you and then neighs loudly, almost as if proclaiming you as a mate. You find this to be somewhat awkward, given the sexually accepted rules and standards of this twisted city, however, you don't argue as you simply let the other have his way with you. Besides, with his massive cock still buried inside of you, and probably still leaking with excess cum, it's not like you're actually going to go run a marathon anytime soon. Stroking your changing hands up and down the big black horse's inflated biceps you trace small lines and patterns across the other dark hide before snuggling your face in between the stallion's chest. You think that maybe now it would be a good time to take a quick nap. All around you the sounds of the other stallions crying out in lustful climaxes resounds throughout the small glen and in honor of this you smile happily as you listen to the music of your herd sounding off around you. The scents of cum and musk and sweat fill up your senses as all of your dreams turn to that of running across an open field, your herd mates following behind you while you yourself follow after your mate - the herd leader.";
		say "By the time you wake up you find that the stallion herd is gone, however your transformation has happened during your little respite from the world. A slight pain at your backside makes you wince slightly, but it's a happy sort of flinch that you wonder if you'll ever be able to experience again with your big stallion lover. Shaking your mane you decide that it doesn't matter as what will be will be.";

Tobacco smoking, or what you think is tobacco anyway, equines probably herald nothing good for you anyway. Turning you make move yourself away from the congregation of horses just in time to hear some of them whinny at you to come back.";
