A small slot opens a second later and piercing yellow eyes stare back at you accusingly. 'What do you want?' The person on the other side of the door asks with a voice that's more of a growl than a regular human baritone.";
		say "     Building up your courage, you find your voice and then tell the other that you're here for the [bold type ]Dog Show[roman type]. Feral yellow eyes glare at you before pulling back when the slot suddenly closes. You [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] ears catch the sounds of locks being flicked and latches being unhooked before finally the metal door is pulled open. What you see from the [if daytimer is day]light coming in from the sun[else]strong rays of the moon pouring in behind you[end if] is a powerful husky/wolf hybrid with enough muscles to put a rhino to shame sneering at you implacably.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Go on in to the back, newcomer, but watch yourself.' The mutt of a mutant snarls at you once and then goes about moving aside to let you in. Stepping past the other, you enter into the large warehouse, roll your head around to look over the place twice and then shrug somewhat disinterestedly up at the furry brute of a beast. Turning your head to ask the door guard where the action is happening at, you get a single burly hand pointed directly ahead of you.";
		say "     'Back in the back, you can't miss it even if you tried.' Nodding to the other, you make your way down the well lit hallway of the building without incident as you follow the sounds of cheering and whooping growing louder ahead of you. Figuring that there must be a [italic type]show[roman type] going on, you walk casually into a brightly lit area reminiscent of a caged fighting area... and then let your mouth drop at the insanity occurring in front of you.";
		say "     All around you, there are mutants, both furry and else, and other human-looking creatures shouting and cheering and laughing while looking down into a secured showground where a massive pit bull is busy driving his foot and a half long cock deep into the shuddering form of a demure looking woman graced with golden retriever ears. Six D-cup sized breasts flop back and forth along the bitch's chest as the dirty looking mutt hammers inside of the woman's pussy while grunting and clenching his muscled arms around the zonked out female. The rancid smell of lust, sweat, sex, pheromones, and other assorted scents smacks you dead in the face as you walk further into the spectator ring.";

The black and brown furred male, as you assume the dog is by his lack of breasts, growls while muttering something along the lines of [italic type]give it to her champ[roman type] and [italic type]fuck that bitch[roman type] and [italic type]pound that pussy[roman type] in a nonsensical mantra while humping his bright red Dobie cock up into his curled fist. From the way the foot long piece of dog meat is shuddering and twitching it won't be long before the canine orgasms.";

				say "     Deciding to have a little fun while you're here, you lean over and then open your mouth to take the Doberman's hard cock in between your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] lips. The first taste of the hard and leaking Dobie cock has you murring in rapture as you curl your tongue around the unnamed male's hard shaft. Reaching a hand down to fondle the canine's plump balls, you test the weight of the full orbs and find that what the Doberman is packing is going to be more than enough to be a mouthful for you. The feeling of warmth and wetness suddenly wrapped around him, the Dobie freezes in place and then snaps his head down to look at you. And though you don't look up from where you are busy bobbing your head, you do get the distinct impression that the Doberman likes what you're doing, especially when the strong hand that had been pumping the Dobie's cock moves up to run itself along your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] head.";
				say "     A few grumbles of thanks come from the Doberman, but you almost can't hear it over the noise level in the arena. Sucking at the head of the canine's shaft and then squeezing at the other's balls, you pump your lips up and down the length of the Dobie's cock while swallowing mouthful after mouthful of dog pre. Warm, sweaty and completely masculine, the taste of the Doberman proves to be a good treat for you as you push your face further and further into the other's lap until finally you take the Doberman to the head of his knot.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Tonguing at the fat knob throbbing at the base of the Dobie's cock, you open your mouth wide as you try and swallow around the fat mound of crimson flesh. A sudden shudder and thrust up into your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] maw has the Doberman helping you with this as the canine man forces your head down with a rough shove of his hand, and then barks out to the ceiling as his nuts begin to surge forth with their contents. The hand you have wrapped around the Dobie's balls feel as if it is about to burn off as the orbs held within the dark pouch of fur and flesh churn just in time for molten hot cum to shoot down into your throat.";
				say "     Swallowing what you can as quickly as you can, you don't get much of a chance to back off with the hand still pushing your head down securely into the dog's lap. Gulping down everything the Doberman has to give you, you find your belly getting pleasantly full as the Dobie keeps cumming and cumming without pause. When the other finally does stop firing off his load, you stay where you are for several seconds as you try and get every milky drop of cum out of the other. When you at last get a chance to pull back from off the Doberman, you raise your face up to look the other square in the eye and then lick the Dobie across his pitch black nose.";
				say "     The panting canid doesn't say anything, but he does lick you in return before settling himself further back into the seats of the bleachers you both happen to be seated on. Picking up on some of the sudden quiet going on, you're not prepared to look around you to see a multitude of eyes staring at you in awe. Not knowing what to say, you wipe your mouth off with the back of your [BodySpeciesName of Player in lower case] hand and then turn your head away to look at the scene coming to a close in the cage down below. When heavy arms wrap themselves around you, your body gives a small jerk of surprise right before a dark brown and black muzzle nuzzles up close into your neck.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     'Thanks for that little gift, lover.' The voice is thick and rich and you can't help but lean back into the body of the Doberman hugging up to you as a sense of protectiveness crosses its way along your soul. 'I love a sexy [if Player is herm]herm[else if Player is male]guy[else]girl[end if] like you who knows how to please me. Maybe I can return the favor some time?' You let the other know that you might be willing to have him do that if you have some time later on. 'That's fair.' Unlike many people who might try and flirt and hound to get what they want, the Dobie simply keeps his large, muscled arms wrapped around your shoulders while nuzzling affectionately against your neck.";
				say "     The rising climax of the show happening in the cage comes about a minute after your own, thankfully drawing the crowd of spectators['] attention away from you, after the pit bull barks out twice and then hunches forward into his smooth-skinned bitch before stilling his hips. You don't have to guess about what's happening as you watch the woman yelp and then moan while trembling underneath her stud.";
				say "     'Not a bad show, but I wish the next guy up would be a Doberman. You know what I mean?' the Dobie behind you whispers into your ears, and you can only grunt in response. When the pit bull has finished his work, a large wolfhound steps into the cage and then growls something to the other mutant. From what you can see, the other appears to be the boss around here as the pit bull hastily, but reluctantly, pulls out from the girl and then wipes his soaked cock off on the back of the human-looking woman. The female shudders and then slumps down onto the ground, but has little time for a reprieve as the pit bull swiftly picks her up and then throws her over his shoulder to walk back behind a door that you hadn't seen earlier.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     All around, you listen in mild amusement as the crowd cheers while jeering at the now gaping folds of the woman's pussy. 'Hot stuff, but I prefer my bitches to be a little more willing.' The Doberman licks you across your nape and then croons slightly into your ear. 'You gonna stick around for the next show?' Telling the other that you have something to deal with, you listen as the Dobie whines slightly before releasing you from his hold. 'Well, okay. Oh, and hey, my name's Tyr. I hope I get to see you again.";
				say "     Playfully, you take the Dobie's hand and then lick over his fingers before telling him that you might, if he's ever wandering around town. Your playful move has Tyr growing hard in an instant once again as the half-erect cock belonging to the canid firms back up to half-mast, particularly so when you suck on the other's index finger. 'Oh yes, definitely going to have to meet you again.' The Doberman makes no effort to hide his lust as he grumbles wantonly while arching up to hump at the air.";
				say "     Pulling away from the Dobie, you give the other a seductive wink before moving down the bleachers to go off about your way. You don't become aware of Tyr reaching out to stroke at his second hard on of the hour as you are too busy noticing another dog mutant coming out with a new bitch in tow - this pair being a male husky with a female wolf-human hybrid from the look of them. If what you remember is correct from what Homaru said, then it means that you have little time to waste if you're going to rescue Birch.";

When a grumbling bark of a howl sounds off behind your back, you have a few seconds to be mildly annoyed by the feeling of cum raining down slightly across the back of your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] head. Trying not to be too disgusted by this, you simply reach back to wipe the dog slime off of your neck without even turning around to look at the other.";
				say "     'Damn that was good.' you hear the Doberman say, but you don't really pay the other much attention. The pit bull down below barks out twice and then hunches forward into his smooth-skinned bitch before stilling his hips.

Her hard cock is completely ignored at this point, but nonetheless, it continues to stand erect despite the neglect it's being shown. The scent of hot and horny Dal makes your stomach start to flutter and you silently wonder if you could get away with maybe teasing the gender-mixed canine. With the dog show going on inside the cage, it wouldn't be that hard for you to do, especially since the pit bull is now rapidly drilling at the backside of the smooth-skinned woman. (Y=Tease the Dalmatian, N=Leave her be)";

With her eyes more focused on the show happening inside the cage and everyone's focus more on it than you, you're able to move yourself into the necessary position to bury your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] nose into the wet folds of the Dal herm's snatch. Sniffing over the wet and musky heat of the other, you find your own loins tightening as the musky male and female scents send your mind for a whirl.";

A loud bark summons several eyes over to look at the herm, but you pay them little mind as you suck and lick and bob your head up and down along the other's cock. A rapid-fire series of thrusts of hips up into your face has you almost purring as the Dalmatian humps up into you while still fingering at her wet snatch. The scent of feminine juice mixed with the taste of pre cum has you curling your tongue around the herm's length while reaching out to stroke the unseen balls of the Dal hidden inside of her pants.";
					say "     Steadily working together, both you and the unnamed Dal time your efforts just right so that you can move in a rhythm that works to bring the spotted hermaphrodite maximum pleasure. As the thickening taste of canine pre rushes more and more across your tongue, you make a move to push your face down far enough so that you can actually curl your tongue slightly along the round orb of the Dalmatian's knot while tugging and squeezing along the other's balls. Full and thick within your hand, the Dal herm's nuts feel pleasantly warm to the touch as the furry skin around them pulls upwards somewhat from the eager handjob you give them.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     With you working at your current position, the unnamed Dal has the opportunity to bury her fingers even further inside of her pussy as she bounces up and down on the bleachers. Rubbing against her clit while spreading around her folds with her thumb and index finger, the Dalmatian grunts while lifting her head up to whimper at the ceiling. Knowing that it won't be too much longer, especially by the growing flood leaking from your mouth, you decide to be a little bit playful and pull yourself back up along the Dal's cock until you are literally kissing her head.";
					say "     The moment you feel the other ready to cum, you pull back and then grab the Dalmatian's cock so that you can angle it up towards the other's face. A bark sounds off the Dal herm's orgasm and when she cums, the mixed-gendered canine is not ready to feel both her snatch tightening up around her fingers and her cock shooting cum up onto her white and black-spotted muzzle. You pump at the Dalmatian several times to get out all the cum she has to offer while stroking her trembling testicles inside of their sac. When you finally see the end of her orgasm, you pull your hand away from the Dal's shaft and then proceed to lick the other across the face to clean her up.";

Blinking from the feeling of pain in your cheek, you give the other a strange look. 'Asshole, I'm a girl, not a guy so don't treat me like I'm some kind of callboy you can just play with however you like.' The rumbling snarl from the spotted canine makes you nod without having to think twice. Trying to apologize gets you nowhere as the herm Dal simply gets up, after wiping herself off with a handkerchief, and then goes about her way down the steps of the bleacher and then out of sight.";
					say "     Not understanding what just happened, but not exactly feeling that guilty about it, you simply shrug and then turn to watch the rest of the show. The eyes mocking you and the voices snickering inside of your ears mean little to you as you lick your tongue across your teeth. Tasting the last of the herm's juices, you think over how you'll plan to save Birch from his fate. Thoughts of the disgruntled Dalmatian are already leaving your mind in favor of more important things.";

When brown eyes whip down to look at you with the mask of a surprised spotted face, you smile and tell the herm that you'll take care of her. The Dalmatian says very little as you lean your head down and then bury your face in between her legs. The sweet scent of Dal bitch filling your nose makes your stomach rumble in want and without having to be told to, you quickly slip your tongue into the unnamed herm's gooey pussy.";
					say "     The hissing moan the Dal lets out brings a feral smile to your lips, especially when firm thighs begin to close around your head. Chuckling at the Dalmatian's antics, you vaguely note that the other, while being completely dual-gendered, and possessing a pretty nice piece of meat about herself, does not make a move to stroke at her cock. Taking this to mean something, you make no move to either stroke or tongue the Dal herm's erection as instead you drill your tongue further down into your nameless lover.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     When the fluttering folds begin to grip tighter around your tongue, you work just a tad bit faster on the Dalmatian as you bring her further and further towards her climax. Licking over the nub of her clit, squeezing your tongue up deeper against her cervix and then nibbling at the Dal's labia, you listen with self-satisfied pleasure as the spotted canine sounds off her pleasure by groaning and bouncing her hips back and forth into your face harder and faster. A curl of your tongue against the herm's inner depths, followed by a powerful pull of your lips, does the other in.";
					say "     Howling with an intensity the likes of which make several heads turn in your direction, you bring the Dalmatian off just in time for the smooth-skinned bitch inside of the cage to get hilted fully by the pit bull. Your face is creamed with feminine nectar and liberally, you drink up everything you can from the Dal while at the same time burying your tongue up into your lover's fluttering folds. The Dalmatian reaches a hand out to hold you steady as she thrusts her hips forward into you, and in the back of your mind, you have to note how odd it is that the herm makes no apparent move to stroke at her cock, even as the long length of maleness coats your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] head in male cum.";

Winking at the other as you use the back of your arm to wipe off the messy gunk, you don't think twice as the Dal blushes at you and then slowly gets up to move off of the bleachers. Figuring that the other must have something else to do, you straighten up, not in the least mindful of the numerous eyes watching you, and then go on to watch as the pit bull hefts his bitch up over his shoulder to walk out of area, via a slightly hidden door.";

Ironically, it's also just enough time for you to thoroughly enjoy the show going on in the cage, but once you do, you immediately head down from the bleachers to get ready to make your move.

But at seeing them, your heart feels no joy as you look with disgust at how the [']people['] down here are being treated. Locked together in various cells are numerous canine mutants and humans alike, with barely enough clothing to give anyone present any decent sense of modesty about themselves. The fact that the males are on one side and the females on the other, giving the two genders about seventeen feet worth of space apart, mean little less than nothing as the males are growling in an effort to try and dominate one another while the females are busy whining and whimpering, offering their tails up to the furiously needy males through the bars of the cage.";
		say "     The unquenchable fires of lust surging through the males have made all of them perpetually horny, but in a place like this, there seems to be no [italic type]dominant[roman type] male to lead the rest of the pack. From what you can observe, the males are mostly trying to bluster in their efforts to assert their authority over one another, despite the fact that all of them have sticky tails and rumps, and permanently hard cocks sticking out of sheaths and between smooth thighs alike. When one male does mount another to begin fucking him, another male is quick to take the backside of the occupied [']alpha['].";

The people upstairs must have realized that if left alone for too long with one strong male lording over the lot then the possibility of a revolt might become a reality that the guards might not be able to handle. A sad thing really, since this probably hasn't helped the damaged psyches of the canines down here to regain some sense of pride about themselves. Moreover, from the looks in their eyes, all thirty three of them, the canines and humans are so lost in their lusts that they don't seem to even realize that they are prisoners.";
		say "     Surveying the lot of them, you can see that most, if not all of the males trapped here, are either fully canid in physical appearance or have some varying canine-like features about themselves. From floppy ears to curled tails, there is not one human here who has not been affected by the virus. Yet, that begs the question of why the [']humans['] haven't fully turned yet? Maybe something to do with their individual genetic compositions?";

The small nub of a tail highlighting the firm buns of the other is... somewhat tempting... you have to admit, if only silently, as you watch the Rottie moan while rubbing across her four ample tits. From what you can see of them, after looking around the buxom black and brown-colored bitch, the rest of the females are in the same shape as the men.";
		say "     Narrowing your eyes to look the lot of them over, you can see that the bitches look as though they've been used hard and put away very wet as cum and other fluids are dripping down onto the floor around them in large puddles.

Keeping them close would ensure that the males never lost their lusts and that even if they did try and copulate with one another, they would always be hungry for a bitch. The heat scent is probably boiling the blood of every male in here, [if Player is male]and without wanting it to happen, you find yourself falling prey to such desires as your cock thickens inside of your pants[else]but the scent does little for you as you brush your hand in front of your nose to cast aside the slightly annoying scent[end if].";

The Dobie, who appears to be slightly roughed up, is moaning and struggling to little avail as he works to get himself free from the dark-furred mutants holding him still.

There's a lot of shoving and barking and growling, but you have very little time to worry over the consequences of this as you go over to see about Tyr. 'Hey, thanks man,' the Doberman says gratefully while trying to keep his long tail from wagging excitedly. 'I didn't think that this whole thing was a setup to get more dogs in for the show, but whether I knew or not, if you hadn't shown up I might have been in some serious trouble.'";

The naked Dobie reaches down to palm at his cock and then leers at you somewhat playfully. 'A big stud like me turned into a bitch? Now that would truly be a travesty, wouldn't you agree?' Blushing when the black and brown canine winks at you, you can only roll your eyes as the other begins to stroke at his rising cock. A grunting cough later, you remind the other of where he is. 'Oh, sorry about that.' The hand that had been stroking at his cock quickly becomes lavished in firm licks and playful nips as Tyr brings his hand to his muzzle.

Turning to look at the females getting their cunts and asses pounded by the large group of males, you wonder how much more [']willing['] one could be, given the situation. 'Yeah, I know what you're thinking,' Tyr's voice snaps your attention back towards the other. 'but what I mean is, I like lovers, not toys to play with. And those bitches,' Tyr says while nodding towards the other cage. 'they'd screw each other if they had cocks on them.'";

Tyr reaches around to grab at your hips to pull you closer into him, but you slip away before the other man can do so. A hurt look crosses the Doberman's strong muzzle, and to clear up any misconceptions, you inform the Dobie of why you are in this place in the beginning.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     'Oh, so you are the one Homaru was talking about! And here I thought you stumbled across this place by accident. I didn't know I had a vigilant hero sucking my dick off a half hour ago.' You blush and then nudge Tyr in the gut for his comment which gets a laugh out of the other man. Realizing he had spoken about the informant, you ask the Doberman how he knows Homaru. However, Tyr just shakes his head at you. 'Don't worry about it. Anyway, why don't you go and do what you can for Birch while I go and do something to make things easier on you.' A cautious nod later and you are handing the key to the cells over to the Dobie. 'Thanks for trusting me and for saving my tail.'";
					say "     'Tell you what,' Tyr says just as he goes to take a step away from you. 'When this is over, come by my place and we'll see about getting you fit into shape, and maybe getting some play time in with each other, okay?' You tell the Doberman that you'll think about it which gets a large smile out of Tyr. 'That's more than I could have hoped for.' The Dobie whispers, but by the time you realize what he said, you are trying to look over the human-like males fucking the bitches to try and see which one is the firefighter you're supposed to be saving. Coincidentally enough, Tyr makes his exit out of the room just as you are trying to remember what Homaru told you about Birch that would make him stand out from the rest.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Not knowing what to do as you continue to watch the smooth-skinned males humping the feral bitches, you decide to ultimately just call out the other man's name and see what happens. Upon doing so, one of the lust-drunk canid hybrids stop and then turns to look at you with almost hauntingly almond brown eyes. Floppy black and white ears perk up on to the top of the brown-haired man's head as the other cocks his head to the side while looking at you in question.";
					say "     Seeing the other and then going over to speak to him, you watch as clouded, almond eyes blink at you before something registers inside of the other man's mind. 'Y-yeah... I-I'm Birch. A firefighter at Station 86. Oh damn!' the floppy-eared human-mutant hybrid grunts before his hips thrust themselves automatically into soft, wet folds of the bitch in front of him. 'I-I...' You don't have a good feeling about the other staying as he is, especially not with all of this rampant debauchery going around, so doing what you think at the time, you quickly pull the other man back by the shoulder and out of the bitch's wet snatch.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     A whine comes from him at the loss of heat around his knotted canine dick, but you don't take the time to care as you hear the sounds of someone coming down the stairs. What it turns out to be is a large wolf/husky mix, the same as the one who had been guarding the doorway. However, instead of walking down the stairs, the other man tumbles and then ends up lying sprawled onto the ground, unconscious. From the mix of blood and saliva leaking from his nose, you can assume that someone punched him in the face with some surprisingly powerful force. When Tyr comes down the steps rubbing his knuckles into the opposite palm, you can only chuckle at the other.";
					say "     'What? Could I really have let them do what they wanted to me and then get away with it?' You shake your head at Tyr, laughing outright when the Dobie goes over to literally walk all over the unconscious door guard, and then ask him what he's done. 'Oh, just cause a mass amount of confusion. I don't think this place will be left standingfor much longer, so why don't we get out of here?";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Turning your head to regard the others, Tyr nods and then uses the keys he still has, just dangling off of his tail end rather than in the pockets of the pants he now has on, and then goes to unlock the cell doors. You are hardly surprised when none of the others make a move to escape, not even Birch who is shivering from excitement in your hold. When Tyr comes over to whisper something into your ear, you find yourself blinking at the incredulity of what the Doberman says. 'I think they'll leave when they've had enough, but currently that's not our biggest issue right now. What is, is [italic type]us[roman type] getting out of here. So, let's move it!'";
					say "     You nod and then turn to look over Birch's naked form. Not thinking much of it, you snatch your shirt off from around your [BodySpeciesName of Player in lower case] shoulder and then go to rip it. Handing the now single long piece of ruined fabric over to the other man, you watch as the firefighter nods to you and then makes his move to wrap the material around his waist into a makeshift loincloth. Once that's been taken care of, the three of you quickly rush up the stairs and then out of the building, though not without you noting the forms of several guards and other assorted persons sprawled out on the ground and the complete lack of the crowd from before within the arena.";

Once outside though, underneath [if daytimer is day]the warm rays of the sun[else]the cool light of the moon[end if], 'Well, it was fun guys, but it's time for me to get lost.' Asking the Dobie about his offer from before just as Tyr is about to step off, you listen to him quietly chuckle before he answers you, 'My place is just a little further down from the park. So sue me, I like nature. Anyway, if you want to just come by. I should be there either night or day.' And with that, Tyr turns and then races away towards the heart of the city.'";
					say "     'Weird guy.' You tilt your head at hearing Birch speak. Asking him what he means, you get a very... unusual answer. 'I don't think I know him personally, but I could almost swear that I feel like I've known that guy all my life.' Not understanding, you turn towards Birch to ask him to explain just a little more on what he means. 'First off, my business is none of yours, and for the second thing, there's something [']weird['] about that guy. His smell is off and his body... it isn't [']right[']. It's like...'";

If you're heading to the fire station, let Kenaz know that I'll be around sooner or later, okay?' Nodding to the other man, who seems to rapidly becoming more [']human['] as the minutes roll by now that he's away from all the bitches still inside of the warehouse, you let Birch know that you'll do just that.";
