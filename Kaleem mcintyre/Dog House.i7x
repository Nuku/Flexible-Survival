		say "Finding yourself coming across the drab looking warehouse that Homaru had told you about, you walk up to the metal doors of the edifice and then knock onto its front. A small slot opens a second later and piercing yellow eyes stare back at you accusingly. 'What do you want?' The person on the other side of the door asks with a voice that's more of a growl than a regular human baritone.[line break]";
		say "Building up your courage you find your voice and then tell the other that you're here for the [bold type ]Dog Show[roman type]. Feral yellow eyes glare at you before pulling back when the slot suddenly closes. You [facename of player] ears catch the sounds of locks being flicked and latches being unhooked before finally the metal door is pulled open. What you see from the [if daytimer is day]light coming in from the sun[else]strong rays of the moon pouring in behind you[end if] is a powerful husky/wolf hybrid with enough muscles to put a rhino to shame sneering at you implacably.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "'Go on in the back, newcomer, but watch yourself.' The mutt of a mutant snarls at you once and then goes about moving aside to let you in. Stepping past the other you enter into the large warehouse, roll your head around to look over the place twice and then shrug somewhat disinterestedly up at the furry brute of a beast. Turning your head to ask the door guard where the action is happening at you get a single burly hand pointed directly ahead of you.[line break]";
		say "'Back in the back, you can't miss it even if you tried.' Nodding to the other you make your way down the well lit hallway of the building without incident as you follow the sounds of cheering and whooping growing louder ahead of you. Figuring that there must be a [italic type]show[roman type] is going on at you walk casually into a brightly lit area reminiscent of a caged fighting area... and then let your mouth drop the insanity occurring in front of you.[line break]";
		say "All around you there are both mutants, both furry and else, and other human-looking creatures shouting and cheering and laughing while looking down into a secured showground where a massive pit bull is busy driving his foot and a half long cock deep into the shuddering form of a demure looking woman graced with golden retriever ears. Six D-cups size breasts flop back and forth along the bitches chest as the dirty looking mutt hammers inside of the woman's pussy while grunting and clenching his muscled arms around the zonked out female. The rancid smell of lust, sweat, sex, pheromones, and other assorted scents smacks you dead in the face as you walk further into the spectator ring.";

The black and brown furred male, as you assume the dog is by his lack of breasts, growls while muttering something along the lines of [italic type]give it to her champ[roman type] and [italic type]fuck the bitch[roman type] and [italic type]pound that pussy[roman type] in a nonsensical mantra while humping his bright red Dobie cock up into his curled fist. From the way the foot long piece of dog meat is shuddering and twitching it won't be long before the canine orgasms.";

The first taste of the hard and leaking Dobie cock has you murring in rapture as you curl your tongue around the unnamed male's hard shaft. Reaching a hand down to fondle the canine's plump balls you test the weight of the full orbs and find that what the Doberman is packing going to be more than enough to be a mouthful for you. The feeling of warmth and wetness suddenly wrapped around him the Dobie freezes into place and then snaps his head down to look at you. And though you don't look up from where you are busy bobbing your head, you do get the distinct impression that the Doberman likes what you're doing, especially when the strong hand that had been pumping the Dobie's cock moves up to run itself along your [facename of player] head.[line break]";
				say "A few grumbles of thanks come from the Doberman, but you almost can't hear it over the noise level in the arena. Sucking at the head of the canine's shaft and then squeezing at the other's balls, you pump your lips up and down the length of the Dobie's cock while swallowing mouthful after mouthful of dog pre. Warm, sweaty and completely masculine, the taste of the Doberman proves to be a good treat for you as you push your face further and further into the other's lap until finally you take the Doberman to the head of his knot.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "Tonguing at the fat knob throbbing at the base of the Dobie's cock you open your mouth wide as you try and swallow around the fat mound of crimson flesh. A sudden shudder and thrust up into your [facename of player] maw has the Doberman helping you with this as the canid man forces your head down with a rough shove of his hand and then barks out to the ceiling as his nuts begin to surge forth with their contents. The hand you have wrapped around the Dobie's balls feel as if it is about to burn off as the orbs held within the dark pouch of fur and flesh churn just in time for molten hot cum to shoot down into your throat.[line break]";
				say "Swallowing what you can as quickly as you can you don't get much of a chance to back off with the hand still pushing your head down securely into the dog's lap. Gulping down everything the Doberman has to give you, you find your belly getting pleasantly full as the Dobie keeps cumming and cumming without pause. When the other finally does stop firing off his load you stay where you are for several seconds as you try and get every milky drop of cum out of the other. When you at last get a chance to pull back from off the Doberman you raise your face up to look the other square in the eye and then lick the Dobie across his pitch black nose.[line break]";
				say "The panting canid doesn't say anything, but he does lick you in return before settling himself further back into the seats of the bleachers you both happen to be seated on. Picking up on some of the sudden quiet going on you're not prepared to look around you to see a multitude of eyes leering at you in awe. Not knowing what to say you wipe your mouth off with the back of your [bodyname of player] hand and then turn your head away to look at the scene coming to a close in the cage down below. When heavy arms wrap themselves around you your body gives a small jerk of surprise right before a dark drown and black muzzle nuzzles up close into your neck.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "'Thanks for that little gift lover.' The voice is thick and rich and you can't help but lean back into the body Doberman hugging up to you as a sense of protectiveness crosses its way along your soul. 'I love a sexy [if cocks of player > 0 and cunts of player > 0]herm[else if cocks of player > 0]guy[else]girl[end if] like you who knows how to please me. Maybe I can return the favor some time?' You let the other know that you might be willing to have him do that if you have some time later on. 'That's fair.' Unlike many people who might try and flirt and hound to get what they want, the Dobie simply keeps his large muscled arms wrapped around your shoulders while nuzzling intensively into your neck.[line break]";
				say "The rising climax of the show happening in the cage comes about a minute after your own, thankfully drawing the crowd of spectator's attentions away from you, after the pit bull barks out twice and then hunches forward into his smooth skinned bitch before stilling his hips. You don't have to guess about what's happening as you watch the woman yelp and then moan while trembling underneath her stud.[line break]";
				say "'Not a bad show, but I wish the next guy up would be a Doberman. You know what I mean?' The Dobie behind you whispers into your ears and you can only grunt to answer to him. When the pit bull has finished his work a large wolfhound steps into the cage and then growls something to the other mutant. From what you can see the other appears to be the boss around here as the pit hastily, but reluctantly, pulls out from the girl and then wipes his soaked cock off onto the back of the human-looking woman. The female shudders and then slumps down onto the ground, but has little time for a reprieve as the pit bull swiftly picks her up and then throws her over his shoulder to walk back behind a door that you hadn't seen earlier.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "All around you listen in mild amusement as the crowd cheers while jeering at the now gaping folds of the woman's pussy. 'Hot stuff, but I prefer my bitches to be a little bit more willing.' The Doberman licks you across your nap and then croons slightly into your ear. 'You gonna stick around for the next show?' Telling the other that you have something to deal with you listen as the Dobie whines slightly before releasing your from his hold. 'Ok, oh and hey, my names Tyr. I hope I get to see you again.[line break]";
				say "Playfully you take the Dobie's hand and then lick over his fingers before telling him that you might, if he's ever wandering around town. Your playful move has the Tyr growing hard in an instant once again as the half erect cock belong to the canid firms back up to half-mast, particularly so when you suck on the other's index finger. 'Oh yes, definitely going to have to meet you again.' The Doberman makes no effort to hide his lust as he grumbles wantonly while arching up to hump at the air.[line break]";
				say "Pulling away from the Dobie you give the other a seductive wink before moving down the bleachers to go off about your way. You don't become aware of Tyr reaching out to stroke at his second hard on of the hour as you are too busy noticing another dog mutant coming out with a new bitch in tow - this pair being a male husky with a female wolf-human hybrid from the look of them. If what you remember is correct from what Homaru said then it means that you have little time to waste if you're going to rescue Birch.[line break]";

When a grumbling bark of a howl sounds off behind your back you have a few seconds to be mildly annoyed by the feeling of cum raining down slightly across the back of your [facename of player] head. Trying not to be too disgusted by this you simply reach back to wipe the dog slime off of your neck without even turning around to look at the other.[line break]";

Her hard cock is completely ignored at this point, but nonetheless it continues to stand erect despite the neglect it's being shown. The scent of hot and horny Dal makes your stomach start to flutter and you silently wonder if you could get away with maybe teasing the gender mixed canine. With the dog show going on inside of the cage it wouldn't be that hard for you to do, especially since the pit bull is now rapidly drilling at the back side of the smooth skin woman.(Y=Tease the Dalmatian, N=Leave hir be)";

A rapid-fire series of thrusts of hips up into your face has you almost purring as the Dalmatian humps up into you while still fingering at her wet snatch. The scent of feminine juice mixed with the taste of pre cum has you curling your tongue around the herm's length while reaching out to stroke the unseen balls of the Dal hidden inside of hir pants.[line break]";
					say "Steadily working together both you and the unnamed Dal time your efforts just right so that you can move in a rhythm that works to bring the spotted hermaphrodite maximum pleasure. As the thickening taste of canine pre rushes more and more across your tongue you make a move to push your face down far enough so that you can actually curl your tongue slightly along the round orb of the Dalmatian's knot while tugging and squeezing along the other's balls. Full and thick within your hand the Dal herm's nuts feel pleasantly warm to the touch as the furry skin around them pulls upwards somewhat from the eager handjob you give them.";

Rubbing against hir clit while spreading around hir folds with her thumb and index finger the Dalmatian grunts while lifting hir head up to whimper at the ceiling. Knowing that it won't be too much longer, especially by the growing flood leaking inside of your mouth, you decide to be a little bit playful and pull yourself back up along the Dal's cock until you are literally kissing hir head.[line break]";
					say "The moment you feel the other ready to cum you pull back and then grab the Dalmatian's cock so that you can angle it up towards the other's face. A bark sounds off the Dal herm's orgasm and when shi comes the mixed gendered canine is not ready to feel both hir snatch tightening up around her fingers and her cock shooting cum up onto her white and black spotted muzzle. You pump at the Dalmatian several times to get out all the cum shi has to offer while stroking her trembling testicles inside of their sac. When you finally see the end of hir orgasm you pull your hand away from the Dal's shaft and then proceed to lick the other across the face to clean her up.";

'Asshole, I'm a girl not a guy so don't treat me like I'm some kind of callboy can just play with however you like.' The rumbling snarl from the spotted canine makes you nod without having to think twice. Trying to apologize gets you nowhere as the herm Dal simply gets up, after wiping hirself off with a handkerchief, and then goes about hir way down the steps of the bleacher and then out of sight.[line break]";
					say "Not understanding what just happened, but not exactly feeling that guilty about it, you simply shrug and then turn to watch the rest of the show. The eyes mocking you and the voices snickering inside of your ears mean little to you as you lick your tongue across your teeth. Tasting the last of the yummy tasting herm you just had you think over how you'll plan to save Birch from his fate.

The Dalmatian says very little as you lean your head down and then bury your face in between hir legs. The sweet scent of Dal bitch filling your nose makes your stomach rumble in want and without having to be told you quickly slip your tongue into the unnamed herm's gooey pussy.[line break]";

Chuckling at the Dalmatian's antics you vaguely note that the other, while being completely dual gendered, and possessing a pretty nice piece of meat about hirself, does not make a move to stroke at hir cock. Taking this to mean something you make no move to either stroke or tongue the Dal herm's erection as instead you drill your tongue further down into your nameless lover.";

Your face is creamed with feminine nectar and liberally you drink up everything you can from the Dal while at the same time burying your tongue up into your lover's fluttering folds. The Dalmatian reaches a hand out to hold you steady as shi thrusts hir hips forward into you and in the back of your mind you have to note how odd it is that the herm makes no apparent move to stroke at hir cock, even as the long length of maleness coats your [facename of player] head in male cum.";

Figuring that the other must have something else to do, you straighten up, not in the least mindful of the numerous eyes watching you, and then go on to watch as the pit bull hefts his bitch up over his shoulder to walk out of area, via an slightly hidden door.[line break]";

But at seeing them your heart feels no joy as you look with disgust at how the [']people['] down here are being treated. Locked together in various cells are numerous canine mutants and humans alike who have on barely enough clothing to give anyone present any decent sense of modesty about themselves. The fact that the males are on one side and the females are on the other, giving the two genders about seventeen feet worth of space apart, mean little less than nothing as the males are growling in an effort to try and dominant one another while the females are busy whining and whimpering while offering their tails up to the very need males through the bars of the cage.[line break]";
		say "The unquenchable fires of lust surging through the males has made all of them perpetually horny, but in a place like this there seems to be no [italic type]dominant[roman type] male to lead the rest of the pack. From what you can observe the males are mostly trying to bluster in their efforts to assert their authority over one another, despite the fact that all of them have sticky tails/rumps and permanently hard cocks sticking out of sheaths/between smooth thighs alike. When one male does mount another to begin fucking him another male is quick to take the backside of the occupied [']alpha['].";

The people upstairs must have realized that if left alone for too long with one strong male lording over the lot then the possibility of a revolt might become a reality that the guards might not be able to handle. A sad thing really since this probably hasn't helped the damaged psyches of the canines down here to regain some sense of pride about themselves. Moreover, from the looks in their eyes, all thirty three of them, the canines and humans are so lost in their lusts that they don't seem to even realize that they are prisoners.[line break]";
		say "Surveying the lot of them you can see that most, if not all of the males trapped here are either fully canid in physical appearance or have some varying canine-like features about themselves. From floppy ears to curled tails there is not one human here who has not been affected by the virus. Yet, that begs the question of why the [']humans['] haven't fully turned yet? Maybe something to do with their individual genetic compositions?";

From what you can see of them, after looking around the buxom black and brown coloured bitch, the rest of the females are in the same shape as the men.[line break]";

Keeping them close would ensure that the males never lost their lusts and that even if they did try and copulate with one another, they would always be hungry for a bitch. The heat scent is probably boiling the blood of every male in here[if cocks of player > 0]and without wanting it to happen you find yourself falling prey to such desire as your cock thickens inside of your pants[else]but the scent does little for you as you brush your hand in front of your nose to cast aside the slightly annoying scent[end if].";

'Hey, thanks man,' the Doberman says gratefully while trying to keep his long tail from wagging excitedly.

However, Tyr just shakes his head at you. 'Don't worry about it. Anyway, why don't you go and do what you can for Birch while I go and do something to make things easier on you.'
