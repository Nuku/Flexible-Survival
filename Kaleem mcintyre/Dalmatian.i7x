	now body entry is "lean and limber with hidden muscles as your canine body hides what strength you have underneath the pale wisps of black spotted fur covering your body. All across your arms, legs, thighs, chest, and torso you have almost unseen muscles cropped along your wiry body as your cano-mutant form is now more suited for maximizing your newfound dexterity with extreme running, jumping, bounding and leaping rather than fighting with what strength you do possess, what with you now possessing digitigrade feet instead of the normal plantigrade ones that other mutants boast";	[ Body Description, format as the text "Your body is (your text)." ]

	now body change entry is "your entire form starts to increase in length. If that wasn't odd enough when the muscles you have along your chest, arms, legs and torso quickly go to receding back into your body you feel yourself almost wanting to curl up and shiver into a tight knit ball as your body pumps all of your strength into your thickening bones, giving them extra added density needed for holding up your escalating form. You actually have to stop yourself from jumping around like mad as your heels stretch up to give you a twin pair of digitgrade feet as the raw urge to [']go play['] takes you over down to your core";	[ Body TF text, format as "Your body feels funny as (your text)." ]
	now skin change entry is "white fur pushes free from out of your pores.

When the other gets a hold of your scent the Dalmatian immediately senses something wrong as it turns to look you over. Slowly padding its way over to try and administer comfort onto you, you find yourself whimpering back at the other as the need to rut as well as play overtakes your sensibilities. At the touch of the Dalmatian's cold nose touches your legs you kneel down next to the other Dal and then nuzzle the other four legged canine in turn before whining at it in confusion. Quickly as can be the feral creature barks into your face and then grabs you by your arm with its sharpened teeth to drag you off somewhere.";

When you ultimately find yourself coming to an red brick edifice, which [italic type]really[roman type] looks familiar to you, you bark happily as you think that you've finally found the place where you belong. This fact is made even more certain when your new friend releases your arm and then goes over to bark and scratch at the front door to the building. Upon getting a response from someone from the inside you find yourself panting in joy as your bright eyes look over the form of a tall white and black spotted canine, this one standing on two legs instead of all fours, whom your confused canine mind screams at you that you should know intimately. Hurriedly you go over to tackle the other and then proceed to show them in rampant licks across the face.";

The soldier you just stole the walkie-talkie from doesn't try to retrieve his communication device as you are swiftly haul tail out of the sheltered area to go see what you can do to help.";

Finding the person who had been squawking to you over the radio, quite literally in fact, you find yourself walking over to a large Pelican wearing a two-piece suit looking over the burning building with a quiet glare in his beady eyes. Asking the other about how many people are left in the complex you get your answer from a chimpanzee mutant instead of the bird. The simian creature nervously informs you that most of the people on the upper floors are outside now, but there might still be others on the lower floors. Not wasting a second to go over options you simply charge into the building and then begin sniffing around for any civilians who might have been left behind.";

No one present needed to guess what would happen next once the single flap to the tent you and your companion had been left in flipped to a close.
