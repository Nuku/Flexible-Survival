Instead of resolving Jam Session:
	say "     Searching through the junkyard for something to take your mind off of the suffering that seems to be trying to grip at your heart you find your ears perking as you catch the sounds of an electric guitar being strummed followed by someone else starting to sing. Finding it odd to hear an instrument being played right here and now you make your way over to the source of the sound without having to think twice about it. Completely forgoing the possibility that this may all be a clever trap by a group of cunning mutants you find your body coming alive in a scary sort of way as your senses begin to tingle at the growing volume of the music filtering into your ears. Continuing to follow the song around a large tower of ruined cars you find, to your delight, a small group of four mutants all jamming together on different instruments. So close to the music as you are now you find that the young adults are making the right kind of melody to get your heart thumping wildly inside of your chest as your mind screams, somewhat fanatically, that you're in front of one of your favorite local bands. If you remember correctly the name of the group is Fallen Roses and they were supposed to be and up and coming group that had been scheduled to come into the city for a month long tour. How awesome is it that you're getting to see them for free right here and right now?";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Excitedly you let your eyes watch as two wolves play on a set of drums and electric keyboards, respectively, as a striped feline flicks his claws along the strings of the electric guitar while at the head of the group a female rabbit vocalist sings her heart out. Taking stock of the clothes that the others are wearing you note that mutates are draped in a mixture of torn jeans and ripped shirts made to fit around the band members new tails and bulkier anthropomorphic forms, a big contradiction from their usual cool and clean psychedelic tie-dyed styled clothing. Apparently Fallen Roses had been trying to make a statement with their apparel to say that when a rose loses its luster and withers away to fall onto the ground the mind and soul are quick to follow as both time and logic soon enter into oblivion... or something like that. Turning away from your inspection of the other's attire you find that most of the anthros have their eyes closed as they seem to just be working in synch with each other instead of reading from scripted musical notes. You soon find yourself bobbing your head in time with the music as the group continues to jam throughout the junkyard without a care in the world.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Surprised that no other ferals have come out to see what all the noise is about you find your eyes turning to the side as you notice blue flames rising up out of broken pots and flickering around the group, highlighting each of the band members features as well as billowing out a steady stream of hazy smoke. Sniffing the phosphorus fumes you begin to feel somewhat lightheaded and then dizzy as the need to [italic type]flee[roman type] quickly takes you over as your nose begins to itch more and more. Reaching up to rub at your nostrils the scent reminds you of something akin to rotten eggs as you continue to get buffeted by the clouds of blue. Caught between the smoke and your slight obsession with the group your mind slowly begins to process the disparity between your two wants before coming to a conclusion about what's going on. Quickly you come to realize that this is how the others keeping the other mutants away. Whatever this smoke stuff is it seems to be acting as a natural repellent to other creatures probably not immune to it like the band members are. Reaching up to cover your nose with the collar of your shirt you step closer into the azure clouds and then note, joyfully, that you can breathe somewhat easier now.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Having to give credit where its due you nod your head at the group for their ingenuousness before blinking as you notice that most of their instruments seem to be connected to wires that run the course along the ground and into makeshift generators. Thinking that the others must have rigged this up when the power to the city got cut you smirk in astonishment as, not only have the others survived this plague, but they have adapted to it so much that they have made it a gain rather than a loss. Not wanting to break up this happy moment you watch the group for a few more minutes before taking slow steps backwards, once you've had your feel of the music. Turning and then leaving you disappear through the barrier of smoke keeping the group safe, never noticing how the two wolves have their eyes cracked open just a tad bit as they watch you depart.";

Section 3 - Blind Boy's Love

Blind Boy's Love is a situation.
The sarea of Blind Boy's Love is "Junkyard".

Instead of resolving Blind Boy's Love:
	say "     You find yourself stopping abruptly as a familiar noise makes its way across your field of hearing. Turn your head towards the sounds general location and then concentrating you come to realize that you know exactly what the ruckus is on about. Ducking quickly behind a slightly beaten up old Lexus you manage to trace the panting and yelping noises of two forms fucking one another coming from around a beaten up truck three yards away from your current position. Curiosity makes you wonder if you should you go and try and see what's happening, after all someone might be in need of help. But then again, this might turn into an all out fuckfest if you happen to get caught up in a mutant orgy.";
	say "     [bold type]So do you go over or turn tail and run away?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Go over.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Turn tail.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Deciding what the hey you take tentative steps over to the derelict truck and then creep upwards onto the broken and bent hood of the vehicle to get a better looks at what's going on. What you find is a sight that you are all too familiar out here in the middle of the infected city as you watch the form of a massive feral Rottweiler slipping its engorged black cock back and forth inside of the anal vent of a young man on his knees underneath the brown and black furred canine. It's obvious from the looks of the almost miniature horse sized canine that the feral hound has been corrupted by the strangeness infecting the town, however you find that despite this the young man beneath the beast seems not to mind what his companion is doing to him as he willingly gives himself over to the massive stud dog. The teenager, who couldn't have been more than nineteen years old, looks for all the world as if he's enjoying himself as he lets the larger creature drill him while slapping gargantuan canine nuts into the young man's slowly inflating furry orbs. Everything you've come to expect in this scenario is working itself out perfectly as the human's skin is quickly being replaced by milky chocolate fur while at the same time the skeletal structure of the youth is twisting into that of a canid.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Hands growing thicker while feet are lengthening and angling upwards in order to support the human's forming canine structure you find yourself growing somewhat uninterested in the whole process, as you have seen more than twice before. Not sure what's going on you wait and watch for a few more minutes as you work over in your head the pros and cons of getting involved in this little exchange of affairs. Getting ready to turn your head away so that you can leave, the other human seems to be too far gone for you to help anyway, your attention is drawn back to the coupling pair by words that you hadn't expected to hear coming out of the panting teenager's broadening muzzle. 'Good boy Scout.' The auburn haired teenager huffs wetly as his ears start to reach further onto his head before becoming floppy. 'Make me a stud like you so we can always be together.' The teen grunts when the Rottweiler slams into him hard one good time and then locks them together. You're not sure how the smaller human has managed to take, what you can only assume as the gargantuan knot of the mutant dog behind him, but that fact is rendered moot as the youth's body slowly balloons outwards with the onset of growing muscles, bones and tendons. A series of grunts and barks come from both canine and transforming human as the young man thrusts himself back as hard as he can onto the Rottweiler's last few inches of cock. 'Now no one will be able to take you away from me. They think that I need a new guide dog just because you're getting too old, but we'll show them.' The youth then begins to giggle while lolling his leaking tongue out from his lower lips as the drooling organ becomes too thick for the new cano-sapien's forming muzzle to hold onto.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     This new information makes you somewhat curious about this little affair happening before your eyes as you watch the bigger Rottweiler whimper and croon while nuzzling his cold nose into the furry nape of his former owner. However, before you can think about it too hard the youth starts talking again. 'Or rather [italic type]you[roman type] will once I introduce you as my boyfriend. I've always wished I could be like you ever since we first did this together. How cool is it that this all happens right when you're supposed to taken away from me?' The boy growls as his hard cock becomes thick and tapered while the skin around his groin bunches to become his new sheath. From what you can surmise there seems to be a lot going on here, some of which you're totally not sure about, but you can only shrug as you realize that it doesn't matter in the face of this strange, but beautiful form of friendship taking on a new level. The rottie doesn't seem to take much care in what its new bitch is saying, you think, before the canine starts to speak up out of the blue. 'Let's hope that this makes your eyes better Gareth,' the Rottweiler says in a much more mature voice than what you would have expected a canine to be able to muster as he hunches forward into his new mate twice more before ceasing all motion. Resting comfortably onto Gareth's developing back you watch with wide eyes as the dominant canine's balls begin to pull up close into his lower body just as the rottie makes himself ready fully inseminate his master. A yelp from both males later and you can only watch in awe as quart after quart of rottie cum literally floods out the back of the smaller Rottweiler's forming tail-hole. The small stub of a tail wags pulling up behind the boy's backside gives a happy wag before its liberally covered in canine spooge.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Griping the filthy ground with strong paws while filling his former master up to the brim you listen as the taller canine continues to speak into his new mate's twitching ears. 'I want you to be able to see me for all that I am before deciding that you want me as anything more, ok?' The full canine pants before slobbery licking across the now almost fully changed youth. Down below the other mutant canine a look-alike Rottweiler stands, not quite as big as the one on top, but close enough to be comparable in strength, as the boy-dog whimpers and then barks before shuffling his legs to spread them outwards. A few huffs later you figure out why the former human is doing this as Gareth gives a sharp bark and then erupts all along the dirty, oil slick ground underneath him and his lover with the last of his human cum. 'I...I love you Scout!' The new Rottweiler shouts while at the same time shivering in climax. Eyes closed tight you can't see Gareth's eyes to know if the process has worked or not, but you decide that it doesn't matter as the bigger stud canine licks his newly mutated master onto the side of cheek suddenly. The kind of intensity that the bigger male shows for the small lets you know all that you need about the future of the two cano-mutants. Deicing that now would be a good time to take your leave you don't bother to stick around to see anymore. You've already spied on this sacred moment for a minute too long anyway.";
	else:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Deciding to err on the side of good common sense you make your way from the area you're in just as two howls fill out into the air behind you. Before you exit the vicinity completely you could have sworn that you heard someone shout 'I love you!' sometime after those twin howls tapered off into low croons, but that couldn't be right, could it?";

Section 4 - Dragonian Trial

Dragonian Trial is a situation.
The sarea of Dragonian Trial is "Beach".

when play begins:
	add Dragonian Trial to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving Dragonian Trial:
	say "     Upon making your way to the beach you end up stumbling across a young man with green hair standing in the middle of an empty area of the beach while looking out at the lapping waters. Thinking little of this, as this is the seaside after all and some people do come here to think, you find yourself almost passing the other without a second thought before you notice something bizarre about the youth. The fact the other is almost completely human seems to be the highlight of your befuddlement as you wonder how the other hasn't been changed into one of the numerous mutants that now all but dominant the city. Watching ivy green hair dance in the wind, a long pony tail swaying in time with the motions of the incoming salty sea air, you find yourself almost captivated by the young man as you notice all of the perfectly cut lines framing the youth's long body as he stands with his arms cross while gazing out at the ocean. The white tunic that he has on, draped down all the way pass the middle of his thighs, combine with the tight fitting black leggings give the other somewhat of a medieval feeling as you note an actually sword sheathed alongside the youth's belt.";
	say "     Not really sure what's up with the other you find yourself curious to know more about the young man as you take a few cautious steps over to the green haired one. Yet, before you can get too close, you find that the other has sensed you as he quickly whips his head around into your direction -- one hand being placed carefully onto the hilt of his weapon. Reaching up to wave your hands defensively you try and tell the other that you don't mean in any harm, but the gleaming red eyes of the other seem not to believe you. Taking a step back to show your true intent you watch as the young man springs backwards into the air and then begins to hover slightly. Eyes nearly widening into the size of saucers you watch as the other curls in on himself until he's in a fetal ball-like position before spreading himself outwards with both of his arms spread wide into the air while his legs point straight down towards the ground.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Not understanding exactly what is going on all you can do is watch as the green haired youth's form soon shifts and then melts only to reform into that of a long serpentine dragon of the eastern countries. Golden scales glean brightly as the dragon floats into the air while letting his long clawed hands, of which there are four steaming from proportionally sized scaled arms, curl together into tight fists while he shakes his head as though having been caught in a daze. The whiskered serpent soon looks down at you with glaring golden eyes and suddenly you know how a bug feels as your life slowly starts to flash before your eyes. You're kinda sad to find that you still haven't gotten to eat that hidden stash of junk food you have placed securely underneath one of the beds of the bunker you're holding up in. At almost forty feet long the eastern dragon holds your life almost literally into its clawed hands as it growls and bares fangs down at you. Unbridled fear rips through your soul as you see nothing short of imminent death looking your way.";
	say "     [bold type] Running would see like a half good idea right now, but at the same time where would you run too?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Run.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Wait.";
	If player consents:
		say "     Turning to run you bolt as though the hounds of hell themselves are after you. Damn it being a good idea or not, it's now time to go! You don't think as the need to...escape...flee...run...screams through your veins as your blood rushes rapidly throughout your body. You don't stop to take notice of how the dragon is looking at you with a contemptible look in its golden eyes, or how the creature's clawed hands are slacking open as a sense of ire rises within the beast. The elegantly scaled creature seems to narrow its eyes as it watches your departure before huffing and then flying away, back probably to some place you could only ever dream about.";
	else:
		say "     Knowing that this is it you decide to do the only thing you can. Sticking out your chest and standing straight in front of the reptilian creature you await its judgment without fail. There's really nothing else you can do since the beach is too wide open to find cover to run at. And strangely enough you have a feeling the thing can swim rather well with that serpentine body it possesses so diving into the ocean is out. Standing up and giving the dragon your most ferocious stare you let the other make the next move.";
		say "     Astonishingly enough the dragon seems to approve of your bravado as it smirks at you with a mouth full of one too many sharp fangs and then clasps its forearms together to give you a small bow. Blinking in awe you watch as the magnificently frightening creature slowly turns away from you, after rising back up, and then flies away, off to somewhere you'll probably never be privy to in this life. A sense of awe comes over you as you sigh and then deflate as your knees slowly weaken and then collapse, sending you down onto the sandy floor.";
