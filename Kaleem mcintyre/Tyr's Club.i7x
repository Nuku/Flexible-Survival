Tyr's Club by Kaleem mcintyre begins here.

Section 1 - Tyr's Club

Tyr's Club is a room.  It is private. It is fasttravel.

The description of Tyr's Club is "Inside of the underground room hidden underneath an unused cabin inside of the park Tyr has made a large gym/fighting arena where several dozen mutants are busy training, exercising or otherwise practicing some form of physical training. Over by the side you can see Tyr watching the collective with a wary eye. The Doberman is standing as strong and powerful as he usual is, but instead of being draped in his usual jeans and t-shirt he's only wearing a pair of cut-off camouflage shorts. Said shorts happen to be showing the Dobie's more than plentiful crotch off, and from the large bulge hiding within it would seem that Tyr is not lacking in the cock department."
Tyr is in Tyr's Club.
West of Tyr's Club is FightPit.
North of Tyr's Club is LockerRoom.

Instead of sniffing Tyr's Club:
	say "The club smells heavily of sweat, tension, concentrated focus and lots of testosterone/estrogen.";

Tyrtalk is a number that varies.

Tyrfucked is a number that varies. Tyrfucked is usually 0.

Tyr is a man. 
The description of Tyr is "Standing roughly at about seven feet, three inches tall with floppy brown ears and a long, but thin curled tail is the Doberman you met at the dog show arena back at the warehouse district. With only a pair of camouflage shorts on the black and brown furred canine's muscular frame regally stands out as he leans across an undecorated wall while watching the proceedings going on inside of his club. That is, until he turns to notice you walking up to him. The other canine doesn't seem to be specifically trying, but there is an intimidating aura coming from off of him as he stares pointedly at you with his piercing green eyes. Holding you fast into place you don't feel as if you can take a step forward or backwards as the Doberman narrows his jade orbs at you. However, this feeling soon passes when Tyr smiles and waves you over. His perfectly straight fangs give you pause for a second though as the sharpened incisors look ready to rend both flesh and bone. Why does he suddenly seem so much scarier than he had before back at the arena???";
The conversation of Tyr is { "Battle is the Key to Success!" }.
Tyr is in Tyr's Club.

Instead of sniffing Tyr:
	Say "Tyr smells like a hardworking Dobie who has a couple of secrets he's not willing to share. Oh, and he also smells like a good fight!";

Instead of conversing the Tyr:
	if Tyrtalk is 0:
		say "'Hey, it's good to see you!' Tyr walks over and then hugs you before giving you a noggie across your [facename of player] head. 'Welcome to my club by the way, sorry I didn't tell you everything when we met up before.' Tyr says after pulling back. 'I...well let's not worry about it, but anyway. This is my place. A little hideaway for those who are looking to try and build up their muscles and skills so that they'll be able to survive the chaos going on upstairs.[line break]";
		say "'You're more than welcome to have a look around and to do whatever, just remember I've got three rules here.' The Doberman says in all seriousness. 'One, if you want to fight, do it in the pit. I catch you trying to start some shit in here then you deal with me, and believe me I'm hell in a hand basket on a good day.' You nod when the Dobie starts to growl at you and then smirks with all teeth.[line break]";
		say "'Two, I don't mind if you want to have sex in the place. Hell, I almost expect it, but please, if you're going to do the dirty, clean up afterwards. I don't have a maid around here and I like cleaning up about as much as the next bachelor.' Tyr sighs gives a long-suffering sigh at this before reaching up to pinch the bridge of his nose. He mutters something under his breath, but whatever the Doberman says it's not in the native tongue you're speaking. 'There's a mop, bucket and broom over by the other side of the cage. Feel free to use them.' Again you nod at Tyr, though trying not to chuckle as you do as he looks to wearily around the club.[line break]";
		say "'Last thing, if you've got a grudge against someone bury it at the door. This place is made for people who are looking to workout, get off and maybe release some pent up aggression. I don't care about your personal business. So do leave it behind when you come. Again, you start some trouble, I'll start worse trouble.' Tyr growls at you while lowering his eyes slightly. 'You got me?' Again you can only nod while swallowing thickly. 'Ok, well other than that welcome to the club.' Tyr pats you on the shoulder hard enough to make you wince.[line break]";
		say "'I'll be here for a while, but I may disappear from time to time, so if you don't see me,' The Doberman shrugs at this. 'Anyway, I think that's everything...oh! One thing before I let you go,' Tyr points to the arena. 'There are some Great Dane's in there who are looking for someone to fight. If you do up against them, be extra careful because they are almost as vicious as me when they want to be! And that's something.' Turning to look at the fighting pit you watch as two of the Danes are fighting with each other. From what you can see the battle is almost sickening to watch as the two bitches hit each other with enough force to make blood splatter out the sides of their muzzles. The sad part about this is, they seem to like it when they hit each other like that as when one wipes blood from the side of their muzzles the injured one barks and then bares fangs in a manic smile at her opponent.[line break]";
		say "'Like I said, do not fuck with them lightly. I think they were all abused women at one time or another, or something, and now they've become something like fury incarnated because any [']male['] or female that steps to them wrong in there gets an extra helping of asswhooping when fighting them. Make sure that if you step in there that you are ready for a tail beating the likes of which will leave you with more than a couple of bruises. 'Oh, and if you are too pregnant, don't bother going in there. The rep I have watching over the place will [bold type]NOT[roman type] let you fight.' Tyr looks down to your belly and then sniffs you lightly.'[line break]";
		say "Well, I think that's everything. I'm going to just be here for a while looking over the place so if you need anything just let me know and I'll see what I can work out.' Tyr reaches around to tap you lightly on the ass and then snarls in your face deviously. 'Also, if you want me to tap this ass then you'll have to fight me in the arena. I don't like messing around with weaklings so if you coming to take me on be prepared for a serious fight.' Tyr rubs across your rump and then licks you across the side of your neck while running his fangs across your [skin of player] skin.[line break]";
		say "'On the odd chance that you beat me, I can accept that I might lose, I'll give you my ass in return. Ugh...one thing though,' Tyr rubs the back of his head while lifting his muzzle up to grumble in vexation. 'This virus has made me a tad overly infectious so if you're looking to fight me be prepared to get infected after I win and fuck you or you win and fuck me. Though, then again, you'd look kinda good as a Dobie.' Tyr rumbles a heated growl in front of your face as he says this and you chuckle apprehensively at the other.[line break]";
		say "'Anyway, that's about it. Come, fight, fuck, have fun, but respect and obey my rules.' At that the Doberman turns away from you to go back looking around inside of his club.";

Tyr sneers sexually at you before turning the both of you around and then pushing you bodily into the wall of the cage. A grunt surges free from your lips as your [bodyname of player] body hits the unforgiving barrier, but you have little time to be discomforted by this move because soon the Doberman has your pants unzipped and his nose buried into the outer folds of your pussy. When a cold nose brushes up against your clitoris you shiver as rapt pleasure runs across your spine, but when a warm tongue rolls across the inside of your labia you can only gasp as your hands reach down to caress the top of Tyr's floppy eared head.[line break]";
			say "You think you hear the other say something about [italic type]naughty bitch[roman type], but you're not sure because when next the Dobie's tongue moves the organ heads up to caresses into the inside of your cervix.

Not knowing how to handle the mind-blowing feel of the Dobie's fur tickling your crotch while his tongue washes your insides down with his warm drool you howl up to the sky as your nethers flex around the Doberman's nose. From the slow rocking motions to the firm and unrelenting hands holding you in a controlled grasp you find yourself getting the oral of a lifetime as Tyr savors the taste of your cunt across his tongue.[line break]";
			say "With this kind of stimulation it doesn't take long for your back to arch and then your mind to explode as something reminiscent of a elephant's trumpet goes off throughout your head. A howl and tightening of your pussy a second later and Tyr is drinking down your warm nectar as you liberally flood the Dobie maw with your warmth. Tyr doesn't seem to mind, actually he seems to enjoy your climax the same as you as he buries his tongue further up into your drooling nethers while lavishing the outer edges of your cunt in unrestrained adulation. It takes some time, maybe about five minutes, but when you come down from off of your impressive sexual high you find that your pants have been corrected back onto your waist and Tyr is nowhere in sight.";

			say "'Believe it or not, but I'm not really that horny right about now.' Tyr seems a little miffed about this and looks up at the sky almost evilly before shaking his head. 'So instead of sex, how about some training?' Looking over the other to see if he's serious you find yourself nodding when Tyr looks pointedly at you. 'Alright,' Walking the two of you over to the center of the pit area you had been fighting in Tyr gets himself into position and then begins to show you some forms that you could stand to learn. The other is rough with his teaching, and given your weakened state you find yourself stumbling more often than not and getting fussed at because of it, however, you have to admit that Tyr is a good trainer and you learn a couple of things you didn't know before.[line break]";
			say "When the two of you are done you find the Doberman taking you out of the arena and then into one of the rooms here in the club to give you a massage. 'This is to help you muscles relax so they won't be so achy later on.' Is what the Dobie says, but for some reason Tyr seems to find your crotch area the most interesting part of you to massage after he stripes you out of your clothes and then begins running his hands over your sweating [bodyname of player] form. However, you don't say anything to the other about this. Instead you simply smile and relax as the Dobie goes over your arms, chest, thighs and legs. When he dips some of his fingers into your cunt to begin rolling them around inside of you, you pass out on the table minutes afterwards as Tyr presses along your g-spot causing you to orgasm.[line break]";
			say "When next you return to consciousness you find that Tyr is gone, but your [bodyname of player] is charged with a strange kind of energy. Though oddly enough, even though you find yourself dressed, you note that your crotch has a slightly sticky feel to it. Looking down you realize that it's because your pants are half open and something warm is covering over the crux of your thighs. Reaching and hand down and then bringing it up to your nose to take a whiff, you find yourself chuckling in amusement.";

			say "Tyr kisses, or rather voraciously licks you across your face and then backs you against the end of the cage wall. Not having the energy to fight him after you little stint at trying to knock his head in, you simply give in to the Doberman as he shucks you out of your pants and then proceeds to rub his plump groin against your cunt. 'I'm so going to enjoy this. Do you know how often I get to fuck a willing [']anything['] in this place, wait, never mind, that didn't come out.' Tyr chuckles abashedly after breaking his lips from the connection they share with yours.[line break]";
			say "Not knowing what to say, as your mind is a little tripped out from that previous lip lock, you just let Tyr do as he pleases while you watch. When the Doberman moves a hand down to reach for the clasp of his shorts your lips pull up into a lecherous smirk as you watch the impressive sheath of the other pulling back from around eight hard inches of Dobie dick. 'Don't worry,' Your eyes snap up to look into the chuckling face of the other canine. 'I promise that you won't feel anything but a minor discomfort from me burying my lance into your sheath.' You dubiously look to the other before getting another lick across the face.[line break]";
			say "'Worry not, as I'll nay hurt a valiant warrior such as you,' Tyr promises just as the last few inches of his cock slip free from his furry pouch. When he dips the tapered head of his cock inside of you, you think the other a liar, that is, up until Tyr holds himself steady outside of your fluttering pussy and then looks you dead in the eye. You almost balk at the intensity within those orbs, but finally nod your consent when the other continues to remain firmly outside of you.[line break]";
			say "At your behest, Tyr thrusts his hips forward to bury the first few inches of his cock inside of your nethers. A hiss is your reply to this and the Dobie is quick to soothe your pain away with loving licks across the throat. Only when your [bodyname of player] body loosens itself from the tension coiling throughout does Tyr continue driving his forward inside of you. Feeling the Doberman moving further and deeper inside of you, you hiss and keen up to the other man as both pain and pleasure melt together inside of your head. Yet, it's only after the other is buried up to the tip of his knot that the Doberman stops to allow you the time to adjust.[line break]";
			say "[bold type]BIG[roman type] is the word that pops into your head as you wiggle your hips against Tyr's own muscular thighs. Feeling the Dobie fat balls hanging between his legs and brushing up against your taint you moan as your cervix locks up tight around Tyr in an attempt to hold him steadfast into you. 'There we go, now just enjoy the ride.' And with that Tyr is pulling back to begin thrusting inside of you.[line break]";
			say "Unlike a true Doberman Tyr doesn't jack hammer himself inside of your cunt in an effort to get off. Instead the other man works to find your most sensitive places in an effort to bring you unrestrained pleasure as he works his tapered tip further up into your cervix. As his waist rocks back and forth with slow, almost leisurely humps, for a moment, you forget yourself as you look into the jade green eyes shining back at you with unrelenting passion. With weighty orbs tapping at the underside of your body you are reminded of the finger dancing along the rim of your anus, threatening to push up inside of you.[line break]";
			say "However, Tyr makes no move to do so. Instead the Dobie is content with massaging your backside while stretching your pussy further and further around his cock. The knot at the base of his shaft has to be almost half full and you don't fight the wince that follows as it pops into you. A tender tease of fangs across your throat pulls your mind away from what's happening downstairs. When you next look down into Tyr's smiling face you find that the other laughing up at you.[line break]";
			say "Something about his smirk makes you want to belt the Dobie, but you have little time to think on this because soon the Tyr's bulb has inflated fully to tie the two of you together. A few more thrusts, these much more shallow than the first, and then Tyr freezes into place as he bites down onto the side of your neck in a claiming hold. When the first jet of warm seed rushes up into you, you find yourself screaming up to the top of the cage as climax sings throughout your body. You cum seconds after Tyr and quickly your belly fills and then threatens to explode from the wash of fluids going up inside of you.[line break]";
			say "Pulling his fangs away from you the Doberman laves several apologetic licks across your neck as he continues to fill you up. 'I hope that if you have any of my brood that you'll help them to grow into strong pups just like you.' The declaration makes you blush as you think about how romantic that sounds, though quite out of place, given the circumstances. When the both of you drop back down from your mutual climaxes Tyr holds you tight into him as he lets his knot rest inside of you.[line break]";

Yelling out to the world around you, you cream the wall of the pit with a dozen or so ribbons before slumping down onto your knees.

Since you're body is healing at an increased pace you find yourself really getting into the workout the Doberman's putting you through, especially when he comes up next to you to physically change the position of your body to show you a new form.

Then I'll have to train even harder so that I can beat you when next we fight.' Challenge set, both you and the Dobie continue to work out for several more minutes before Tyr calls it a day.

When heavy furred balls tap against the outer edges of your labia you can do nothing to stop the shivers that rack through your body as you tighten your legs around Tyr's straining form.[line break]";
	say "Pounding into you with almost merciless thrusts Tyr pulls back from his kiss just as the edge of his knot threatens to pop inside of your leaking pussy. When firm arms pull you up just a little further off of the ground you yelp when Tyr's bulb slips into you and then locks tight. A growling gasp from Doberman a minute later and soon his fucking motions grow much quicker, though much more shallow by proxy, as he humps you like a true canine.[line break]";
	say "Feeling your cervix getting a serious workout as it contours around the growing bulge of Tyr's knot you yelp and then wail as your pussy is force to widen around the Dobie meat drilling you. Stars slowly filling your vision and your body bucking in time with Tyr's frantic movements you don't think or breathe for a minute as you feel your climax about to hit. When a warm and demanding tongue strokes itself across the edge of your throat you find yourself screaming out to ceiling as all your vaginal muscles lockup tight around Tyr.[line break]"; 
	say "When the Doberman cums he does so with little fanfare as he thrusts into you once more and then suddenly goes immobile. When the first shot of Dobie cum surges up inside of you, you yowl like a cat in heat as you snatch gets baptized by Tyr's warm spooge. When the second, third on up to the fifth shot hit home up into your womb you roll yourself against Tyr as the a fire snakes its way through your spine. The sensation of being filled by the Doberman is almost like being branded and seconds into your stud's orgasm you cum in due course as your flapping nethers wrap around the Dobie like a glove.[line break]";
	say "'Ohh, good girl.' Tyr chuckles, [if cocks of player > 0]but then stops when remind him of your other unnoticed piece of anatomy. 'R-right, sorry, [italic type]sir[roman type].' The snicker from Tyr makes you want to hurt him for some reason[otherwise]until you give him a pointed look. At that the Doberman grunts nervously down at you[end if]. It takes maybe thirty minutes for the Dobie to finish inseminating you and when he does he gently pulls his deflated knot out of you and then lowers your legs back down onto the ground.[line break]";

A sigh of '[italic type]Fine[roman type] as second later and the Doberman grumbles under his breath before he moves over to undo his shorts. At seeing the big and muscular canine looking so...despondent...about giving up his tail you move over to hug yourself up next to the Doberman just as he's about to take off his shorts. 'What are you...?' You don't give him time to wonder as soon you are running a hand across his black and brown fur and then rubbing your fingers along the crack of his rump.[line break]";
	say "A yip of surprise from the other makes you smile and you lean over to tell Tyr that you'll be gentle...ish. 'I'm starting to think that...' You cut the Dobie off from whatever he was about to say as you shuck his shorts down off of his bubble shaped rump and then go to smack him across his brown furred rear. A yelp has you laughing, right up until Tyr growls warningly.[line break]";
	say "Seeing that the other is only going to allow you so much leeway with his pride, you prepare the Doberman's tailhole by slipping a few of your [bodyname of player] fingers into him, after getting them wet with your [facename of player] tongue, while reaching down to unzip yourself to stroke your [cock of player] cock to full hardness. Once you've satisfactorily opened Tyr up, pressing over the pleasure button hiding inside of his rectum to make the other moan and push back onto your slick digits to help with this effort, you pull your fingers out of the Dobie and then line your cock up with his tailstar. A whimper from Tyr has you pausing and then sighing before flexing your arms up around his chest to hug him more tightly into you.[line break]";

When your [facename of player] eyes meet the Dobie's own jade orbs the two of your share a silent understanding before you press your dick into his opened tailhole. The tightness of the other man makes a hiss stream out from between your teeth.[line break]"; 
	say " Obviously, the Doberman doesn't take it up the rump too often. Not if the feeling of being gripped in almost too tight pressure can tell you anything about Tyr's subbing days. Another whine from him and you nip the Dobie onto his floppy ears to tell him to keep quiet. Continuing to move your cock inside of him you take care to move slowly so as to give Tyr ample time to adjust.[line break]";
	say "Once you're in to the hilt you give the Doberman another moment to relax and grow comfortable to your girth before making your move to pull out of him. Two-thirds of the ways free you wait for another few seconds to let the Dobie get settled before pushing forward into him. Watching the Doberman's reaction you find Tyr shivering from being speared onto you the way he is and think to yourself that maybe ending this would be for the best. That is, right until the other pushes himself back onto you out of the blue.[line break]"; 
	say "'Fuck me already before I lose my nerve!' Tyr says and you happily oblige the other by pulling back from out of him again and then slowly pushing forward so as to fuck him in a slow and even pace. Your balls knocking into those of the Dobie's you can tell that this is going to be a good fuck by the way Tyr spreads his legs just a little wider for you.[line break]";
	say "Your thrusts are sharp, but focused as you hump Tyr's butt in a way that make both of you groan in rapture. Everyone else around watches with a pleased eye to see you giving the tough-as-nails Doberman his due, and from the panting going in your ears some of them must be really getting into things.[line break]"; 
	say "Moving your hips just a little faster as you feel Tyr's insides accommodate around you even better you bite down onto the side of the Doberman's shoulder and raise up over him just a little more in an effort to plow even harder along his sweet spot. A thankful moan purses free from Tyr's lips as the Dobie leans over further while hiking his tail up further against his back. Hugging the defeated Doberman tight while grinding, thrusting and bucking into him like a wild animal you feel your balls tighten and lift up in between your legs as your orgasm hurriedly approaches.[line break]";
	say "Fleetingly wondering if Tyr is getting off on this you sneak a hand down to feel the Dobie's neglected cock. Feeling the weight of Tyr's leaking manhood inside of your palm you pump at the hard length of Doberman meat to bring your lover off in time with you.[line break]";

Not really minding the fact that you're getting Doberman spooge onto your hand you hum blissfully into Tyr's ear, after you pull your [facename of player] teeth from off of his shoulder. When you've filled up your mate of the hour to the brim you hold yourself steady to make sure none of your cum will run out of the other before wrapping your hand around the bulb of Tyr's knot to give it a teasing squeeze.[line break]";
	say "'Cheeky bastard,' Tyr mumbles good-naturedly and you give him another firm squeeze before kissing him along the back of his neck.

A small boy seems to be looking over the area from atop a desk off to the side of the entryway of the arena. Should he be here? Walking inside of the pit several you find several mutants looking at you with differentiating masks of emotions covering their faces. Some seem really eager to see you, others...well they look happy, but in the same way a dog does when looking at a new chew bone. Be careful, it looks like trouble may start here!";

With grey fur, wire framed lens, red ball cap on and slightly chubby puppy face looking up at you with bright golden eyes you wonder if Tyr knows the other is here. Staring somewhat transfixed by the other's cute pointed ears, button nose, and, from what you can see by peeking over the desk, chubby black furred body you wonder if the Doberman has lost him mind by having the other in this kind of place. That is, right before you notice the sign that says [bold type]Receptionist[roman type] hanging down from off of the side of his desk with a giant arrow pointed upwards. For real?";

LockerRoom is a room.

The description of LockerRoom is "The room where the lockers are kept is rather comfy as the white walls surrounding the area offset the silver metal containers standing in two separate rows from one another. Inside of here you can both see and smell several different mutants all walking around. Some are conversing with each other while others are storing things inside of their respective lockers, but strangely none of them seem especially hostile or lustful towards one another. Maybe releasing some excess aggression in the pit has calmed down their raging hormones?";

Instead of sniffing LockerRoom: 
	say "The locker room smells of fresh polish, multiple mutants, sweat, testosterone, estrogen, and other varying scents. Though strangely, no trace of cum or female juice can be found within here.";
