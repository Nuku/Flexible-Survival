		say "     Walking through the dimly lit alleyways of the city, you manage to come across a lump of a figure lying prone on the trash strewn ground. Cautious as to who or rather what this might be, you carefully pad your way over to the thing, ready to run away at a moment's notice. Hoping vehemently that the thing is not some lust drunk mutant taking a nap, you pad closer and closer until the rotting scent of decay actually starts to cloy against your sinuses. When the figure doesn't immediately wake after you poke at it several times, you find yourself calming down slightly as you realize that it's you're dealing with the dead body of a soldier instead of some other kind of freak.";
		say "     It's sad that sights like this are becoming normal. Idle curiosity makes you wonder how the armed forces member died out here like this. The spatter of blood around the other's head has you guessing that it must have been a head wound, but you aren't going to flip the person over to find out, the soldier was lying face down so you can only see his/her backside. Pulling backwards and then saying a quiet utterance of a prayer, you somberly turn from the dead figure to leave, however, before you can do so a voice suddenly calls out making you jumping almost a foot into the air.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Come... in... anyone... are... out... please... respond... give... report...!' The feeble and somewhat broken words has you scratching the back of your head in confusion as you rush back over to the soldier to see what the heck's going on. After soothing your racing heart, that is. Kneeling down and then patting the soldier's body you try and decipher where the speaker's voice is coming from before you finally find your answer. Taking a walkie-talkie off of the dead figure, you see a bright green light flashing with an annoyingly fast paced pulse and quickly wonder how to shut the thing off. The last thing you need is for some mutant or another to come around and find you right now. 'I say again, if anybody is out there please respond!' The person on the other end is still nattering on at you and without thinking you push the widest button on the walkie-talkie and then shout into it for the person to shut up!";
		say "     'Who is this?' The person asks and instantly you feel like a retard as you flinch in embarrassment. The last thing you wanted to do is get into an altercation with the unknown individual on the other part of the line and now you've done just that. Contemplating whether or not you should answer, or just throw the thing away, you figure that the least you could do is tell the person your name. After doing so however, 'What happened to Jimmy and the others? Where's the recon team at?' You sadly tell the person, who appears to be male by the tone of the voice coming questioning you through the walkie-talkie, that you don't know. 'So how did you get this transceiver, kid? They just don't fall off of trees.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Annoyance rips through you as the berating tone of the other rants seeps underneath your skin. Telling the guy on the other end, as coolly as you can to keep from starting a meaningless quarrel, you let them know that you got the device from off of a soldier's corpse. Quiet fills the air as the unnamed person gasps.";
		say "     'Look, I'm... sorry for yelling at you, kid. But I need you to find the dog tags of the guy you got this transceiver off of and give me his name. Please, can you do that for me?' Hearing the heartbreak in the other's tone you decide to honor the unnamed male's request. Lowering the walkie-talkie down from your [FaceSpeciesName of Player in lower case] face you grit your teeth before rolling the dead soldier over. You promptly search for the tags while trying not to pay attention to the bullet wound still slightly leaking fluids and gray matter from the carcass's head. Had the other not had a slightly elongated canine face, muzzle parted open with a big and slobbery canid tongue hanging out, you would have been hard pressed to wonder why the uniformed person had killed in such grisly manner.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You can only guess that the other man, as you don't see any breasts on the deceased body, must not have wanted to end up as a freak and ended his life, or had someone do it for him. Grabbing the fallen soldier's gray platted IDs you pull the dog tags up Reciting a name back into the transceiver you hear the man on the other end curse violently followed by the sounds of something crashing into something else, a wall maybe. A few seconds later the other person comes back in on the line, 'Thank you, kid. He's... he was a friend.' You bow your head as you hear a few sobs come from the man speaking to you. 'Listen, I don't know who you are or what you maybe be, but if there's a shred of humanity left in you then please find the rest of the recon team and let them know that the mission is aborted, OK?'";
		say "     You're not sure what to do, but maybe it wouldn't be so bad to do this for the other man. Considering the friend he lost and all it might be good for you to see if you can wheedle some way to escape from out of this place before everything goes completely to hell. A positive response from you has the man sighing and then laughing slightly in relief. 'Thanks. I appreciate this. Also, please take those dog tags and this transceiver with you. The recon team, if they're still alive and sane, will want them as proof of validity to who you say you are.' You nod, even though the other can't see you. 'Thanks again. Hey, this might be seen as in bad taste, but one has to get paid for their work and all so take whatever you find useful from my buddy and use it to stay alive.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     At that the person on the opposite end of the communication line drops the call. You wonder if this is really happening. Is the world really going so crazy right now or are you having a nightmare that you can't seem to wake up from? Looking into the dead soldier's half open eyes you calmly reassure yourself that this could never be a bad dream, it's just too horrible to be anything out of even your most twisted of fantasies. You close the canid-man's eyes before searching through his gear.";

If it weren't for the fact that the other is pressed flush up against the wall and drooling slightly in pure and unadulterated rapture as his face stretches out into a long canine muzzle you might have thought that the other was actually being raped. Then again, in this town you've come to realize that the lines between consent and none consent become somewhat blurred after having seen, not to mention felt, the addictive pleasure of being fucked good and proper by a well hung male mutant. A whine comes from the soldier and your eyes can't help but gaze at that the other as the transforming male tries to get away from the other as he pushes back against the Alpha Husky.";
		say "     A futile attempt indeed, as the aggressive anthro canine seems to enjoy his new bitch's struggles when the uniformed male tries to shove himself back onto his growing knot without meaning to. Growling and biting down onto the rapidly changing shemale's furry neck in a dominant display, you find yourself somewhat at odds with yourself on what to do next. On the one hand you could help the guy out, he might possess your ticket home. Yet on the other, the conflict of becoming a new breeding receptacle seems to be dissolving the other's mind as you watch the glint of reason slowly fading from the other's darkening orbs.";

A malicious grin spreads across your face when you spy a piece of lumber right next to the rutting couple. Running over, with only a simple plan in mind, you know you have to act fast if you want to save the soldier from his horrific, yet erotic fate. Picking up the piece of wood in your right hand, you swing your makeshift weapon directly at the back of the Alpha Husky's head with all the force you can muster. An audible crack rents throughout the air and the thrusts of the mutant canine quickly stop.";
			say "     Pulling your hand back to ready your weapon once again, you find that you don't need to do anything as the canine-mutant falls over onto its side, knocked completely out cold. You miss the popping sound of the canid's long shaft slipping out from the well-fucked hole of the man-dog soldier; however, you don't miss the quiet 'thanks' that comes from the male as he shakily turns to look at you.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     When he does however, you realize that you were already too late to save the other even halfway as three rows of female tits have slowly begun to jut out from the shemale's chest. By the looks of things it won't be long before the male turns completely into a female...unless he can find a way to preserve his masculinity that is. 'T-thanks a lot, kid, but I think I'm done for.' You see the soldier smiling ruefully in your way before he kneels down and then shuffles something free from the pool of his pants. When you notice the polished metal of a gun shimmering in the female-man-dog's hand you find yourself frozen to the spot as you watch the other place the barrel of the weapon to the front of his head. You don't think as you try and stop him!";
			say "     Reaching out and pulling at the other man's arm you fight with him to stop the changing mutant from killing himself, a flashback to the other dead soldier making you somewhat frantic as you don't want to see a repeat of this past happening played out in full detail! The struggle lasts for several seconds, the transforming mutant putting up a really good fight despite your resolve, but eventually his superior skills at hand-to-hand end up with you being pushed back against away from him. 'Why in the hell are you trying to stop me!' The other shouts and you can't help but shout back that this isn't the way to go out.";

The other man points down, and though you don't want to look, knowing what's happening down there already, you find your gaze taking you to the sight of the man's penis shrinking while dribbles of milky white hot female honey oozed down underneath his balls, no doubt from the opening of his new cunt. 'I'll barely be a man in a couple of hours! You really think I want to live like this for the rest of my life? As some bitch to a fucking freak?!";

'What are you talking about?' The anger in the other's voice is steadily becoming a growl and you realize that you don't have that much time before he's lost to his budding feral instincts. Telling him that as long as he uses his cock he will stay a man, per say, you slowly convince the other to put his gun down. It takes a while to do as the other seems to be almost itching to off himself, but finally you reach through to the soldier's strong will to live and get him to drop his gun. Quickly you move over to kick it out of the way, if just so the other won't get any more funny ideas. 'Lord almighty,'";
				say "     The other man begins as he slides down the wall of the building he was standing in front of him. 'I can't believe that I almost. Oh man...' For a minute there is nothing said as the soldier just stares forward, unseeing, as he tries to get his thoughts into some kind of working order. Once he does though, the changeling lifts his head up towards you and then chuckles remorsefully. 'Thanks, kid. You saved me...well what's left of the human me after all. Why did you go through so much trouble for me? You don't even know me and I sure as hell don't know you.'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     You talk to the transforming man about the walkie-talkie you found and then show him the dog tags. You try to pay more attention to the other's widening eyes more than his narrowing face as the soldier continues to change in front of you. 'These are Danny's,' the unnamed man whispers as he take the tags from you and then looks them over. 'We all knew he would get caught first, but nobody wanted to say anything. Damn it all!' The man thrusts the tags back at you before giving a mournful howl up to the sky. The wail is loud and boisterous and you can't help but to shiver from resonating echo running up and down throughout your spine. When the soldier lowers his head it's almost completely huskified now.";
				say "     'We all wanted to split up to try and cover more ground. It sounds stupid now that I think about it, but none of us ever thought that it would be this bad in here! We weren't even close to being prepared for this kind of onslaught!' You watch as the other growls and then flatten his tri-pointed ears onto the top of his head. 'I knew Danny would get caught because he has the worst luck of any of us, but...if you got his tags that means he's dead, isn't he?' You can only nod as the other man's breasts slowly press out further from the white t-shirt that he has strapped onto his still masculine body.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     You shake your head and then remember the walkie-talkie you have and pull it out to give it to the man. The soldier looks at it and then you and then does something very peculiar. Reaching up to take off his dog tags, the shemale places them into your palm, after taking your other hand and forcing it open, and then smiles in defeat.";
				say "     Wondering why the other is doing this, you blink at the man in confusion before watching him strip out of his clothing to reveal a furry pelt growing steadily across both his chest on down to his thighs. The six breasts he has aren't leaking milk just quite yet, but you can see that it won't be long as the fleshy nubs of the nipples began to harden as the mounds continue to swell outwards. 'You said that I can retain my manhood, but not my humanity. While I thank you for telling me that I don't want my friends or family knowing that I've become some he-bitch here in this godforsaken city.'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     The husky herm soon gets onto her hands and knees and then crawls over to the still unconscious Alpha Husky with the inflated bump standing erect on its head. 'If you see any of the other guys,' the soldier, whose name you hadn't been told, says all of a sudden. 'Tell them that I died trying to get a piece of these assholes. Hehe, it would be partially true anyway.' You watch as the shemale reaches out for the prone Alpha Husky and then lifts the other's legs up. Not having to guess what's going to happen next you are up and moving just in time to hear the Alpha Husky come awake as his former bitch spears him deeper with her cock. A silent tear falls from your eye as you let your head hang down low. You may not be fighting a war likes these soldiers, but one thing you are sure of... this is hell.";

Throwing yourself at him in one, final desperation move, you wrench the gun from his hands, sending it to the ground as it fires off a round. The increasingly bitch-like man punches you square in the jaw, knocking you to the ground. 'I'd saved that last bullet for myself, asshole,' he howls. Dropping to all fours, the increasingly canine soldier runs off into the city, soon to succumb to the infection afflicting his increasingly feminine body.";

		say "     'That a [if Player is purefemale]boy[else]girl[end if], I thank you for that. Even if no one else will know what really happened to those guys it'll be good to make sure that their memory survives this crises.' You smile sadly as tears start to pour from the sides of your face. 'Also, one more thing, kid. If you find any of the camps that are unoccupied then just take whatever you want. The same goes with any bodies that might be left behind. It may sound ghoulish but you need what the fallen have much more than they do.'";

We suspect this frequency's been compromised and you don't want them following it back to you. I'm going to shut off the link to this channel. For security, I can't tell you the new channel and codes, so it'll be useless anyway. Over and out, kid. And hey, thanks so much for all you've done.'

Shivering and rubbing your arms you let out a half choked sob before shaking your head and then letting out a fierce yell. Your emotions are too chaotic to hold back your need to grieve any longer. Graciously enough, some force or another keeps any mutants away from you right now. Not even you could be sure of what you would do if you stumbled onto any of the creatures that plague this town right at the moment.";
