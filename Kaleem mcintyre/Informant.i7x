Section 1 â€“ Informant

Informant is a situation.

The sarea of Informant is "High";
smf is a number that varies.

Instead of resolving a Informant:
	if smf is 0:
		say "Walking through the high rise district you find yourself bumping into a black clad man wearing a hoodie. 'Sorry about that fella.' The man apologizes and then steps around you to go about his way. Not thinking anything of the accidental bump you nod to the retreating back of the other person and then go about your way.";
	if smf is 1:
		say "Crossing through the streets of the high rise district you come across the sight of a somewhat black clad figure surrounded by two burly looking mutants. Both mutants seem to be somewhat eager to get at the unknown figure and upon seeing one of them aiming their cock at the person you decide that maybe it's time to do your good deed for the day. Shouting to draw the mutant's attentions you rush the others before they have time to react.";
		challenge "Shemale Smooth Collie";
		challenge "Leopardman";
		say "Taking care of those miscreants you find the black clad figure stepping out from behind an overturned dumpster with slow and nervous movements. 'Jeez, I know things are getting bad, but come on. Really?' The other person sighs before shoving their hoodie down from off of their head. A shock of chestnut colored hair fluffs out from the other's head and upon seeing this you can't help but chuckle. The other person, who proves to be a man by both looks as well as voice, well he almost looks like a rooster with part of his hair sticking up in a spiky sort of way. When the other turns to face you, you quickly school your features as Prussian blue eyes stare at you gratefully.";
		say "'Hey man, thanks a lot for the assist. I think I'd be even more of a mutant than I already am if you hadn't come to my rescue.' Looking the captivatingly human face of the other man you silently begin to wonder just what part of the black coat wearing individual has been mutated. 'Trust me, you don't want to know.' The long suffering sigh tells you that you probably don't want to pry. 'Anyway, if you need my help just ask, I happen to be something of an information dealer here in the city. My name's Homaru by the way and I live over behind the deli just around the block.' The chestnut haired man hikes a thumb across his shoulder.[line break]";
		say "Stopping the other man before he can turn to run off you ask Homaru if he knows anything about the firemen from station 86. 'Why would you ask me about them?' Homaru seems honestly curious and so you explain to him the situation with Kenaz. 'Ahhh, okay. Well I thought that I had heard a rumor like that. Heh, nice to know that even shady information can sometimes even be trusted. The laughter that comes from the other man makes your [skin of player] crawl as you feel something foreboding about the outburst.[line break]"; 
		say "'Sorry about that. Anyway, if you'll come with me to my shop underneath the Bakery then I'll be happy to trade some information with you.' Not seeing anything else you can do at the moment you nod to your new cohort and then begin to follow him back to his abode.[line break]";

Section 2 - Agency

Agency is a room. It is fasttravel. It is private.
The description of Agency is "Back behind some of the less prominent buildings of the high rise there stands and old fashion deli that seems to be in good shape, despite the rough times the city is having. At the side of the deli a stone flight of stairs leads down to where a nondescript black door stands in wait for certain...irregular...customers. Pushing the door open you find a cool office with a fan swirling up on the ceiling filling out the strangely expansive room hidden from the rest of the world. A plush red carpet covers the floor of the room while a single desk and chair stands in front of three large bookcases filled to the brim with old tomes. A comfy looking couch sits to the left of the doorway while a gargantuan fish tank filled with multicolored fish and turtles has been positioned onto the right side of the entryway. All in all the room both looks and feels like something pulled out of an old fashion detective novel, especially with the uninteresting door in the back that looks as though it hasn't seen much use in quite a while. Homaru sitting down at his desk looking over something.";
Homaru is in Agency.

The invent of Agency is { "food" , "food" , "water bottle" , "chips" , "soda" };

Instead of sniffing the Agency:
	say "The room smells of gathered information, deductive reasoning, unspoken secrets and...ham on rye?";


Section 3 - Homaru 

Homarutalk is a number that varies.
Homarusearch is a number that varies.
Findfirefighter is a number that varies.
Fin is a number that varies.

Homaru is a man.
The description of Homaru is "A young man with spiky brown hair and black hooded coat on sits at his desk while [one of]going over some interesting looking notes[or]leafing through information on his computer[or]surveying files that look to be giving him a hard time[or]eating a sandwich[or]chuckling while reading a comic book[at random]. Homaru looks to be somewhere in his twenties, but the feel of the other man makes him seem as though he's about fifty or something. Sharp brown eyes filled with wisdom look up at you as you walk by Homaru and you find it hard not to freeze in place from the look given to you by those dark and seemingly ageless orbs.";
Homaru is in Agency.
The conversation of Homaru is { "I'll find it out for you!" };

Instead of sniffing Homaru: 
say "The information dealer smells like unsolved puzzles and mysterious best left kept in the dark...as well a turkey and ham on whole wheat.";

Instead of fucking Homaru: 
	say "'Whoa! Whoa, there friend!' The brown haired man quickly throws out his hand as you advance on him. 'You're [if cunts of player > 0]cute in all[otherwise]a nice guy[end if] but I don't want or need to have this infection getting any worse on me. So please, for me and all of the people out there who still need information only a reputable informant like myself can gather, keep your [if cocks of player > 0]cock[otherwise]sexy self[end if] at least five feet away from me!";

instead of conversing the Homaru:

		If guy is banned or furry is banned or girl is banned:
			say "Homaru goes over some of the information highlighted on his screen and then freezes all of a sudden. When the power to the building is cut the brown haired man lets out a line of swear words that might have made a nun blush. 'Unbelievable! Someone's caught onto me!' You ask the other what he means and then get a furious stare in return. 'I think that someone's realized you were trying to find the missing firefighters and have shut me down. I won't be able to find any of them for you now.'";
			say "Homaru sighs in the darkness and then flops his head down onto his desk in disgust. The lights to the building come back on seconds afterwards, ironically.";
			Now Homarusearch is 70;
			Now Homarutalk is 1;
		Otherwise:
			say "Rapidly typing on his keyboard Homaru begins to talk to you without looking up into your [facename of player] face. 'Hey, I was looking through some information that I have on hand and I think I found one of the firefighters you spoke about earlier.' Homaru's words make you stare in awe as you try and think up how the other man could have had this kind of info when you only asked him about it, like ten minutes ago. Unless the other was some kind of fortune teller or prophet that should have been impossible...right? Or maybe he was spying on you?[line break]"; 
			say "Pulling out a manila folder Homaru leafs through the information and then goes about giving you some of the highlights. 'It seems that when things started to get out of hand around this city some of the people here panicked and started moving into shelters, bunkers, barracks, or what have you. However, from the Intel I have on hand here, it seems as though some small groups of like-minded mutants began popping up when the outbreak became almost impossible to contain in any one place. After that these said groups worked to grab up as many uninfected people as they can to use them for...well let's just say no good purposes.'[line break]";
			say "You ask Homaru to elaborate. 'Well,' The other man lowers the folder in front of him and then sweeps a hand through his spiky as looks to try to find the right words to say. 'You know how kinky everything is outside right now?' You nod at this. 'Well, it seems as though there are some people more immune to what's going on than others, or at least partially appear to be so.' You get a feeling for what Homaru is saying as the man starts to flush deep red and bite at his lower lip.[line break]";
			say "'Well, uhm, let's just say that there is a place down at the Warehouse district where some of the, shall we say, less [']upstanding['] members of society have gather to host full on sex shows with [']regular['] people and some of the [']furries['] there are outside.' At this you can actually hear part of your brain explode. 'Trust me on this -  there are strange people out there who would pay to see such a thing. And if you are going to ask why...even I don't have enough information to understand that, however, I can say that your missing firefighter is probably there.'[line break]";
			say "Asking Homaru exactly where [']there['] is you watch as the information collector squirms about in his seat and then blushes before chuckling offhandedly as he answers you. 'Oh, sorry, there is a gloomy looking warehouse down at the warehouse district. If you go there and knock three times and then say you're there for the [bold type]Dog House[roman type] special and the guard will let you in. How you go about rescuing the firefighter, well, you're on your own on that one, but I'll give you some information on how to go about it if you like?'(Y=yes, N=No)[line break]";
			if player consents:
				say "'Alright. Once you get into the place you'll be shown to a viewer's area to watch the live sex shows. Now it's during this time that you'll need to sneak away and then head downstairs to where they keep both the mutants and [']people['] locked up. From what I have gathered so far from my contacts around the city, the man you are looking for -- Birch if I remember correctly -- he's one of the few that haven't changed completely. I'm not sure exactly why, but because of this he has become something of a celebrity there. If I remember correctly Birch has dark brown hair, a strong jaw line and almond brown eyes.' Homaru says while placing his hand onto his head and tapping a finger against his brow.[line break]";
				say "'You may be able to sneak him out if you've got the skills for that clandestine sort of espionage or you can just fight the guards there and bust him out. Whichever you decide to do, if you go, go well prepared because getting caught might find you in a cage along with the others, and trust me on this, [italic type] you don't want that[roman type].' Homaru's words are dire enough that you actually shiver some from the intensity he puts behind them. Asking Homaru why he hasn't done a thing about this illicit sex ring if he's already known about it, the spiky brown haired informant simply shrugs his shoulders at you.[line break]";
				say "'I'm an information dealer. I collect intelligence from certain places and then make a profit off of it. I'm not in the business of helping people out who I have no use for or ties to.' Homaru gives you a somewhat bored look after saying that. 'Anyway, you can go anytime you want to, but I would suggest that you do so soon because if the military rolls in then Birch and the rest of the imprisoned [italic type]people[roman type] there might get shipped away before you can help the firefighter.'[line break]";
				say "At this point it would probably be well for you to hurry on about your way, but you hold up when Homaru calls out your name to get your attention. 'You know, if you're going to actually go and do this, then I could help you out by slowing down the military for you.' Asking the other man what he's talking about you find Homaru smiling at you somewhat mischievously.[line break]";
				say "I can [bold type]delay[roman type] the military by spreading some false information out to them. However, these are some serious people we're talking about here, at least as far as things go when it comes to information and handing down orders. If you can trust me to help I'll do what I can to get you some extra time for your little adventure. However,' The spiky headed informant looks at you a little nervously before continuing with what he was going to say. 'I'm still a man after all, so I can make mistakes.'[line break]";
				say "Homaru doesn't say anything else as he sits back down to look at you somewhat helplessly. You get the feeling that the information dealer is trying to be helpful, but at the same time he just seems so... You shake your head and then tell Homaru that you will think about it. At that the other man nods to you.[line break]";
