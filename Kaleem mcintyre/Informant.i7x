Both mutants seem to be somewhat eager to get at the unknown figure and upon seeing one of them aiming their cock at the person, you decide that maybe it's time to do your good deed for the day. Shouting to draw the mutant's attentions you rush the others before they have time to react.";

A shock of chestnut colored hair fluffs out from the other's head and upon seeing this you can't help but chuckle. The other person, who proves to be a man by both looks as well as voice, well he almost looks like a rooster with part of his hair sticking up in a spiky sort of way. When the other turns to face you, you quickly school your features as Prussian blue eyes stare at you gratefully.";
		say "'Hey man, thanks a lot for the assist. I think I'd be even more of a mutant than I already am if you hadn't come to my rescue.' Looking the captivatingly human face of the other man you silently begin to wonder just what part of the black coat wearing individual has been mutated. 'Trust me, you don't want to know.' The long suffering sigh tells you that you probably don't want to pry. 'Anyway, if you need my help just ask, I happen to be something of an information dealer here in the city. My name's Homaru by the way and I live over behind the deli just around the block.' The chestnut haired man hikes a thumb across his shoulder.";

		say "Stopping the other man before he can turn to run off you ask Homaru if he knows anything about the firemen from station 86. 'Why would you ask me about them?' Homaru seems honestly curious and so you explain to him the situation with Kenaz. 'Ahhh, okay. Well I thought that I had heard a rumor like that. Heh, nice to know that even shady information can sometimes even be trusted. The laughter that comes from the other man makes your [skin of player] crawl as you feel something foreboding about the outburst.[line break]";
		say "'Sorry about that. Anyway, if you'll come with me to my shop underneath the Bakery then I'll be happy to trade some information with you.' Not seeing anything else you can do at the moment you nod to your new cohort and then begin to follow him back to his abode.[line break]";

Section 2 - Agency

Agency is a room. It is fasttravel. It is private.
The description of Agency is "Back behind some of the less prominent buildings of the high rise there stands and old fashion deli that seems to be in good shape, despite the rough times the city is having. At the side of the deli a stone flight of stairs leads down to where a nondescript black door stands in wait for certain... irregular... customers. Pushing the door open you find a cool office with a fan swirling up on the ceiling filling out the strangely expansive room hidden from the rest of the world. A plush red carpet covers the floor of the room while a single desk and chair stands in front of three large bookcases filled to the brim with old tomes. A comfy looking couch sits to the left of the doorway while a gargantuan fish tank filled with multicolored fish and turtles has been positioned onto the right side of the entryway. All in all the room both looks and feels like something pulled out of an old fashion detective novel, especially with the uninteresting door in the back that looks as though it hasn't seen much use in quite a while. Homaru is sitting down at his desk and looking over something.".
Homaru is in Agency.

The invent of Agency is { "chips", "water bottle", "soda" }.

Instead of sniffing the Agency:

Homaru is a man.
The description of Homaru is "A young man with spiky brown hair and black hooded coat on sits at his desk while [one of]going over some interesting looking notes[or]leafing through information on his computer[or]surveying files that look to be giving him a hard time[or]eating a sandwich[or]chuckling while reading a comic book[at random]. Homaru looks to be somewhere in his twenties, but the feel of the other man makes him seem as though he's about fifty or something. Sharp brown eyes filled with wisdom look up at you as you walk by Homaru and you find it hard not to freeze in place from the look given to you by those dark and seemingly ageless orbs.".
Homaru is in Agency.
The conversation of Homaru is { "I'll find it out for you!" };

Instead of sniffing Homaru:
say "The information dealer smells like unsolved puzzles and mysterious best left kept in the dark... as well a turkey and ham on whole wheat.";

However, from the intel I have on hand here, it seems as though some small groups of like-minded mutants began popping up when the outbreak became almost impossible to contain in any one place. After that these said groups worked to grab up as many uninfected people as they can to use them for... well, let's just say no good purposes.'[line break]";

From what I have gathered so far from my contacts around the city, the man you are looking for -- Birch if I remember correctly -- he's one of the few that haven't changed completely. I'm not sure exactly why, but because of this he has become something of a celebrity there.
