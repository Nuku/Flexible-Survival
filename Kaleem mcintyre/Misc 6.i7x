Section 1 - Pegasus

Pegasus is a situation.
The sarea of Pegasus is "Plains".

Instead of resolving a Pegasus:
	say "Walking along the dry plains you find yourself watching as a large shadow hovers over the ground above you. Not really sure what's going on you tip your head up only to find a large winged horse looking down at you. White as snow with a wingspan of about twenty feet you marvel in awe at the majestic creature as it glides above your head once and then twice in a large circle before flying off on about its way. The last you see of the mutated creature is its long azure colored tail end whipping freely behind its wide backside.";
	now Pegasus is resolved;

Section 2 - Guess that Character One

Guess that Character One is a situation.
The sarea of Guess that Character One is "Campus".
When play begins:
	Add Guess that Character One to badspots of furry;
	Add Guess that Character One to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Guess that Character One:
	say "While moving your way across the college campus you come to a stop as you notice two students, or anthro mutants you assume are students, seeming to argue with each other while sitting together out on the campus's lawn. Not seeing anything dangerous about the others you hesitantly move closer to them to see what the altercation is about. When you do however, you find yourself blinking at what you hear coming from one of them. 'Omae o korosu!' A slim, but toned half naked brown wolf says. The lupines blue eyes are twinkling dangerously as he shouts to a smaller calico cat feline whose bright violet eyes are smiling up at him. Both are sitting on the ground together with a three foot distance between them and from the looks of things it would seem that the wolf is trying to get a point across to the feline. The calico cat seems to be missing it as he smiles charmingly up at the other. 'Omae o kisu?' The feline repeats, though somewhat off the mark. 'Omae o korosu!' The wolf snarls. A little bit of foam is seeping down the side of his dark muzzle as anger shoots through his bristling hide. 'Omae o kisu!' The feline purrs in pride as his long tail goes flailing around wildly behind his tri-colored feline's back.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "Obviously these two are having a translation failure, but from what you can see of the purple eyed feline the other knows exactly what it is saying is incorrect. If what you are seeing is correct the calico is doing what he's doing just to rile the other, but from the way the wolf looks as though he is ready to kill the feline you have to wonder if the calico knows what he's getting himself into. 'Omae o kisu!' The wolf shouts as loud as he can and then blinks as what he just said registers inside of his brain. The calico is moving through the air faster that you can see as the feline pounces on the wolf, knocks the other down and then proceeds to snog the hell out of the lupine. All the wolf can do is hold on for the ride, and the calico's waist, as the feline begins to hump up and down on top of the other's somewhat lanky form while rushing hands down to remove the spandex shorts the lupine has on.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "It's only when the calico has the wolf's lower half naked that the feline pulls back, his violet eyes have almost turned black with desire, and then proceeds to go down on the wolf. Hot mouth moving to slurp along the wolf's impressive sheath you don't notice it when three other forms come around side of the couple until a grunt forces the calico to slide his maw off from around the now panting wolf's hard red rocket. When you tip your own head up from the spectacle that is the brown wolf's engorged organ, after wiping the drool from off the edge of your lips, you see a bipedal dragon standing next to a lion with half his face covered by his long ginger colored hair and a smaller cheetah laughing playfully while looking down at the two. 'I take it that you won the bet between you two?' The cheetah asks in a dignified manner that makes you wonder what manner of breeding the spotted feline had before his untimely transformation. 'Yep! He said he'd kiss me and so I'm kissing him!' The calico winks to the other feline and then turns his head back to look at the now whimpering wolf. 'You belong to me, wolf boy. Now shut up and let me have my fun.' And with that the calico bends his head back down and then resumes giving the lupine an inspiring blowjob.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "You stay to watch until the wolf arches, howls and then gushes his seed down into the calico's sucking throat before smirking and then turning around to walk away. Obviously this group of friends is very close, else you don't think that the others would have stayed to watch the calico sucking off the wolf as they had without saying anything in conjecture. Had you turned around you would have seen the calico flip the wolf over and then press his nose into the other's rump in order to tongue fuck the lupine's upturned hole, but by then you are already on your way somewhere else. The howl of the wolf would stick in your mind for a while though.";
	now Guess that Character One is resolved;


Section 3 - Guess that Character Two

[Moved to Consolidated Outside Events]


Section 4 - Guess that Character Three

Guess that Character Three is a situation.
The sarea of Guess that Character Three is "Red".
When play begins:
	Add Guess that Character Three to badspots of furry;
	Add Guess that Character Three to badspots of hermaphrodite;
	Add Guess that Character Three to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Guess that Character Three:
	say "Making your way down the streets of the red light district you find yourself watching an interesting sight as one tigress hooker is standing in between two furry male cat figures who seem to be somewhat perplexed with the she-cat. Curiosity getting the better of you, you walk over to see what's going on, but keep well enough away so that you won't be drawn into the situation, unless things dictate else. 'What part of [']we ain't interested['] don't you get, lady?' A hulking tom cat in a grease pit uniform says while growling somewhat angrily at the red dress wearing female. 'Awww, but honey, I could show you and your little friend here such a good time.' The tigress winks before running a finger down the line of her dress and to the bulge sticking out just slightly. 'Uhm, miss. We're not...that is...my friend and I...we're...uhm.' The more lithe ginger furred feline wearing the same uniform as his cohort stumbles over his words while looking up and down the sexy frame of the tigress. It takes the female a second to understand the lankier feline's words, but once she does... 'Ohhh! Well if you two were into each then you should have just said so earlier.' Waving her hand dismissively the feline hooker brushes the two males off suddenly.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "'What!? Where did you get such a crazy idea from, lady!?' The hulking muscular male rants at the now bored looking tigress. Coincidentally this happens at the same time the smaller tom cat says, 'Bingo!' It doesn't take long before the two males are turning their heads to stare at one another in confusion. From what you can see these two have some personal issues to work out between one another. Laughing and shaking your head you move along about your business just as the two males start to sputter and then rub the back of their heads at the same time.";
	now Guess that Character Three is resolved;


Section 5 - Scopaesthesia

Scopaesthesia is a situation.

	If scopnum is 0:
		say "Walking along the streets you find yourself freezing as you feel someone watching you. Turning your head and looking around you find that no one, either mutate or human, is anywhere nearby. However, the feeling of being watched still bothers you. Picking your feet up and moving at a quick pace you decide to move along before something gets started that you may not want to finish.";

Not sure what's going on you turn your head to look around the area cautiously. Not seeing anything strange you shrug and then continue about your way. Ten minutes later the same feeling comes across your mind. Grunting and then stopping dead you spin around behind you, hoping to catch whoever is trying to follow you, or whatever. You end up finding a lustful mutant growling and grinning at you with sinful desire in their eyes. Looks like you've found your mysterious stalker. Now you can let them know how you feel about them by bashing their head in!";

	else if scopnum is 2:
		say "Getting to the campus grounds you find yourself breathing a sigh as you walk underneath a large tree and then settle down for a quick rest. Hunkering down while looking around the somewhat lively college you smile to yourself at how the mutated students seem to be adjusting so easily to their new lives. Wondering if you'll ever be that calm with what's happening you close your eyes to rest. But you quickly snap them open wide when you get the sense that someone is watching you. Getting up and looking around you find yourself getting a few weird looks from the passing mutants as you whip your head back and forth while searching for danger. Eventually someone comes up to speak to you. 'Hey pal, you ok?' A large orca guy says while cocking an eyebrow at you. Shakily you tell him that you think someone is watching you. 'Really?' The large killer whale wearing the black mesh shirt looks around and quickly you feel the sense of someone staring at you fade. 'Well, I'd don't see anybody, well except those cute cheetah girls over there.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "You turn to see who the larger male is talking about and then shake your head before telling the other that the feeling is gone now. 'Oh, well ok. If you don't feel comfortable being alone, you can to my dorm and stay with me a while. There's not a lot to eat or drink, but hey...' The other shrugs somewhat helplessly, and all you can do is nod and smile at him before telling him that you have to go. 'Oh, ok. See ya around, pal.' The orca turns to leave and you grab your stuff to do the same, however the suddenly spine tingling sensation of being watched returns.";

		challenge "Leopardman";
		challenge "Leopardman";
		challenge "Leopardman";
		say "Brushing yourself off after that dealing with the spotted menaces you wonder why in the hell would you be attacked by such a group before your mind rings out a warning. Flipping your head back and forth you try and figure out why you suddenly feel so uncomfortable in the park. However, before you can the feeling dissipates. Shivering and then grunting you decide that maybe a pleasant walk in the park is not worth the aggravation of dealing with whatever is going on right now.";

Not something unusual in this city, really. It's only after losing the group, after you climb over a chain link fence and then around several more buildings, that you stop and breathe a sigh. Chuckling at the incredulity of the situation you stop and then turn your head. Thinking that you saw something, or rather [']someone['] slip through the shadows behind you, you quickly make your way out of the alleyway.";

	else if scopnum is 5:
		say "Making your way to the beach you end up spotting someone standing idly on the sands while looking at the sky above. Not wanting to disturb them you quietly make your way over to someplace else, however, before you can take so many as three steps the sudden feeling of being watched comes over you again like a crashing wave. Whipping your head around you find that there is no one around, save for the mysterious person still looking up into the skyline. Shivering and then shaking your head you wonder if the unknown person is the one who's been tailing you all this time. Going over to them, if only to confirm or deny your theory, you find yourself pausing in mid step when the figure lowers their head and then turns toward you. What you see causes your eyes to widen in complete disbelief because there in front of you stands... yourself!?";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "Not knowing what to think or say or feel, you look at the undeniably [']human['] form of yourself before this all began. You gasp when this person reach out a hand for you. Not sure about what to do, you find yourself walking forward to take the other's hand without thought. Yet just before you can reach your doppelganger, you find that your feet have frozen solid into place and your body has become almost like lead. Both fear and uncertainty grab at your heart as you continue to try and pick your feet up, but every time you try nothing happens. When the other you finally sees that you aren't coming, you can only stare in painful silence as you watch your other self slowly back away from where they had been standing into the waters of the ocean. As the other you continues to move back you find that the human you is slowly starting to ripple and then fade away into nothing.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "A gasps tears you from the scene as you find yourself coming awake on the beach. Sand on your face and wild eyes blinking rapidly in confusion as you pull yourself up from off the ground you're not sure when you fell asleep but you do know that you must have been out a while because your body feels really stiff. Shaking like a dog you pat yourself down to remove much of the grit from off of your body before turning away to go about your business. The sudden feeling as though something is not quite right though makes you roll your head around the side of your shoulder to have a look at the rippling seashore. A faint sense of longing makes you confused for several minutes but you shrug the feeling away before it can become too strong for you to take. The dream you just had is already becoming a faded memory.";
