The priestess has a slender build with a moderadte bust that is covered by her loose-fiiting white robes. Her face is human with a fair-skinned complection and bright blue eyes. Instead of human ears soft and floppy golden rabbit ears sit atop her head covered by a mane of long hair of the same color.";
	say "     From what you can see under her robes starting below the neck her skin is covered in almost glowing silvery scales. Her scaled arms end in taloned hands that are surpisingly dextrous despite their look. Peeking out behind her robes in a golden feline tail that sways back and forth on its own accord, as well as a set of angelic wings that hang from her back. To finish off the golden theme she stands upon a pair of fluffy golden rabbit feet.";

All those pretty colors dancing across the waters and that strange green line that appears before the sun goes away.' The priestess smiles softly, pausing as if recalling the moment. 'Mmh, though the other day I thought I saw something strange floating out there, some sort of castle?'";
		-- 2:
			say "     'The church doesn't get as many visitors as it used to. Though I suppose that's not too surprising with how things are out there. Maybe when things start to calm down again we can have mass again. Before all this happened I used to read stories to kids after all the sermons were finished.'";

			say "     'You know I used to frequent a bookstore down at the Smith Haven Mall. Made friends with the owner there.' Cassiel gently brushed the side of her chin with the back of her talon. 'I hope Beverly and Turtle are okay... She was such a nice woman and I'd hate for anything to have happened to her...'";

'I'd hate to think of what sinful acts they're doing inside such a holy place. If I weren't busy granting this place protection I'd certainly give them a piece of my mind...'";

'I'm sorry, I've been combing through some of the text down in the basement but I haven't come across anything that might help yet. But I won't give up! I'll tell you once I find a lead, so please be patient.' (Will be expanded in a future update!)";
