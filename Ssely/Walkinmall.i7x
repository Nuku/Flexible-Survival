Charmingly, various pieces of litter lie strewn across the floor, the inhabitants of the mall having taken little action against living in their own trash. Despite having little amounts of sexual fluids on the floor, your surroundings seem to give off a very strong sexual smell, much like the rest of the city. In fact - you are rather getting used to it now that you've spent some time around, the scent of sex having been deeply engraved into your mind (and lungs) by now. It seems normal for everyone else, too, judging by the lack of concern on the residents['] faces.";
	say "     In fact, there is lack of any emotion on some of the tired faces the various infected turn your way as you pass. The dreary days of scavenging for food and water have obviously gotten to them. You worry that they might give in at some point, the effort of day-to-day life being too much for their minds - and the mental influence of countless nanites working away at their bodies and brains doesn't help either. As you explore further, the large, open area of the mall radiates safety to your mind; the sights of this community of different beings holding together tightly in such a time of need slightly improves your mood.";

	say "     After a while, it seems that the walls, shops, and residents repeat - passing by barely noticed as your mind is lost in thought. Shaking off your moody trance, you realize that you've done a whole circuit of the place, ending up where you started.";

	say "     Walking through the corridors of the mall, you find yourself wandering for a while, seized by a sudden desire to just unwind a little in a halfway peaceful place. Walking along, you see many interesting members of the people living here and pass a variety of places in the sprawling safe haven - windows upon empty shops - doors leading to mysteriously musky changing rooms - security rooms, miscellaneous booths for selling supplies and aid to survivors. For now though, you decide to go on a stroll northwards, coming past a service corridor leading off to the side - and inside that, there are five friends chatting with one another. You overhear a little of their conversation and curiosity demands that you listen in for even more...";
	say "     'Hey dude, look what I got! A tail!' one guy he excitedly says, his strawberry-blonde hair waving as he bends over, wagging his new, draconic tail - the thick wyvern length wriggling behind him. Other than that, it seemed the young man was largely unchanged - having just a tail, and little amounts of scale that are scattered over the skin on his arms and legs. You casually sit down on the edge of a planter right next to the side corridor entrance, feigning attention at something else in the mall - all the while really watching them from the corner of your eye and listening. The next refugee - a hybrid himself too - chuckles, his own gryphon beak opening as he does so - his long length of brown hair hanging down over his shoulders as he rubs over that scaly tail in surprise. 'God, it's long! So dexterous too, by the looks of things!' Whether it is the infection or just the younger men's horny attitude, the tail veers ever so close to the gryphon-hybrid's legs, coiling around them slightly.";

	if Player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     You decide to stay, watching as the wyvern-hybrid seems to slide his tail up the gryphon's leg, its somewhat rough scales sliding over the part-gryphon's skin. Clearly, the resulting tingling is a pleasant feeling to him, adding to the young man's already lust-covered mind. The various other hybrids chuckle at his sudden submission, then join in and use their hands to rub over his body, their fleeting touches rubbing and teasing his (for now) human skin. You look away for just a second, distracted by a sound in the wide open mall - and by the time you look back, the wyvern-dude has tackled his half-gryphon friend to the floor and is touching him all over. Cheers rise around the two, coming from the other guys watching.";
		say "     Beside them, a young man with ram's horns stands - thick wooly hair covering his head down to the shoulders and dog-tags jingling around his neck as he jostles with his friends for a better view. Then, as he lays an arm around the next hybrid standing by his side, somehow a dam seems to break in the two of them and things escalate quickly. The ram's mouth meets a short, spotted snout - the soft, warm maw of the demi-hyena eagerly accepting the grinning ram's tongue. Wrapping their arms around each other, they half-fall half-crouch to the ground, making out with one another while their cocks rub against each other as they poke out from their pants. This just leaves one - a lonesome otter standing quite close, seeming confused. He is quite obviously the most changed of them all, and yet - he hasn't felt the need to instantly fall down and get quite this frisky yet.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Idly stroking his animal-like member, the guy watches his friends go at it while giving himself pleasure with webbed paws. He throws some furtive glances up and down the hallway from time to time, serving as a kind of lookout for the group - and during one of the glances over his shoulder, you don't quite look away fast enough. With him blushing quite a bit, it seems like the game is up - he has noticed you watching their little groping fur-pile. You do your best to appear oblivious to their antics, staring with fake interest at a water fountain - but still keeping the otter in your sight in the corner of your eye. Then he basically dares you - turning around fully and wagging the hard cock in his hand your way.";
		say "     Of course, such a bold move can't help but draw your gaze and as you glance down to his hard cock, the otter swallows visibly, then bites his lip indecisively. 'I - um, we...' he starts, not really finding any excuse for that they're doing. He stops as he realizes that it is hopeless, instead continuing to showing off, pawing his mustelid cock to the pervert watching him and his friends get off together.";

		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Stay there, watch, and relieve some 'stress'?";

Gripping it tightly and stroking, you enjoy the act of public perversion before you. It turns you on - a lot - your nanite-filled head enjoying the thought of showing off in public - enjoying the thought of watching others fuck - enjoying the scent of sex that lays over the city - and the mall. You can barely think straight right now. Your head awash with feelings of arousal as you stroke, you see the young men in front of you changing more with every moment - each one of them is taking on some aspect of his partner, as they swap body fluids... and nanites.";
				say "     It seems to you that the dominant species in this impromptu orgy are the hyena and wyvern - while the ram has been pushed to the floor, the hyena's cock pulsing inside of him and marking the former soldier as a bottom-boy now. Across from them lie the gryphon and wyvern - their grunts and humping indicating that the gryphon is having a great time being fucked. Of course you stay to watch even more and start getting some ideas about that damn otter - showing off to you with his slim, femmy body that matches his partly-mustelid features so very well. However, you resist the temptation - standing up right now would be a bit difficult without flashing your cock to all those who pass the side corridor, for now oblivious to the things going on in there. Nah, you'll restrain yourself to just wanking off on the down-low right now...";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     In time, your stroking speeds up - the five horny guys you are watching still going at it, endlessly giving into their pleasure. Soon, your cock throbs hard in your grasp before spurting it's stickiness into your hands and over the floor. When your orgasm eventually ebbs off, you don't bother to clean up, instead just quietly shoving your dick back into your pants and zipping up. Standing up and walking away a little way, you chuckle to yourself as you spot the now fully-changed guys emerge from their service corridor a few minutes later. The nanites did change their bodies even more, and now there are two anthro wyverns, two hyenas, and a nearly fully changed otter hiding in their group. The otter smiles at you for a second or two, then follows his friends as they wander off towards the food court.";

Weirdly, during your time exploring the mall you come back to thinking about the cute otter you got off to - his blushing cheeks burnt into your mind, the sight of those webbed paws, that awkwardly grinning face... God... Wait, no! Did the nanites put those thoughts in your head? That must be it, right? You can't get your thoughts straight, so much so that you don't realize where you are going... Then suddenly, you bump into an unknown creature, the lightly furred form of his skin rubbing up against yours while you recoup your senses. As soon as you look up, you spot light brown, slightly oily fur - it is the very otter that you were just thinking about!";
	say "     You apologize immediately for walking into him, just hoping that he doesn't recognize your face from earlier. But of course, he does - instantly. The young guy starts stuttering, clearly flustered by embarrassment - and even more so as you rub your hands over his back, trying to comfort him. Wait, what? You didn't... Gaah! It seems that some nanites want to speed things along, whispering to your body to do things of its own accord - or at least, doing things before you can even decide what you really want to do. 'O-Oh, um... Sorry...' the cute little otter stutters out, his lips trembling visibly - the memory of your previous encounter (and his little show during it) obviously having been engraved into his mind, too. You wonder if that was the nanite's doing, or if he was just an exhibitionist even before the infection...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You chuckle, dismissing his apology and pat off his shoulders, finally managing to quell those thoughts and impulses that sprung up earlier. You watch over his shuddering form, grinning - and can't help but enjoy how easily you reduced him into a squirming mess. Alas, you fix your foggy head and wave him a goodbye, leaving him there, trembling because of your presence. Perhaps you'll bump into him again someday, perhaps not. The infection seems to take away people you see everyday, and judging by how blushy he was... He might just submit at some point.";
