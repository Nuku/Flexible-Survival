Two vicious horns jut through her brow, while her fangs are longer than expected for a snake her size. Most notable is her ability to split her head down its center, forming two crude but functioning half heads each with their own neck half. Her body is lean and has a pair of leathery wings spread from her back, golden brown dust hazing around her. She has two petite breasts on her chest. Her arms are human in shape, but she is gifted with two too many. Her legs are leonine, intimidating in shape. Her tight, rump-less ass is hidden beneath a pair of tails. Each limb looks to be prehensile, nearly as long as she is tall and ending in a spiked knob. Beneath those tails is a wide, female cleft of ocher flesh.";

Coughing a little, you prepare to fight it off. Periodically, the creature waves its wings again, ensuring the dusty cloud remains.";

Sniffing at the air with nose and tongue, the serpent creature smiles down at you in a way only a feral can. 'Yes, strong mate. Deserving mate,' she hisses, going between your legs and working your length with her forked tongue. Whether it turns you on or you merely struggle, suddenly there is a painful sensation in the base of your cock as the corota appears to have bitten into you with their fangs. Bringing their head up to smile at you, again with that feral look, you can see a venom of a different color than normal dripping from their fangs.";
			say "     You don't have long to consider what they did before your length explodes to full, veins bulging as it's forced to be ready for the serpent creature. Too weak to crawl away, too tired to push them off, you're forced to watch as they spread their lower lips before spearing themselves on your cock[if cock length of player > 12], your head forced rapidly past their cervix into their waiting womb[end if]. Bouncing up and down on you pole, 'poison' no longer necessary to keep you readied, you are stuck for some time with nothing but the wet squelching noises and the corota's impassioned hisses to distract you.";
			say "     Eventually, body's betrayal complete, you give the corota their much desired seed, balls swollen by the venom forcing them into crazed overproduction along with your regular load amount. The milking goes on for almost five minutes, and you don't want to consider how much of your mass was [']recycled['] for their pleasure while you watch their belly slowly bloat wider and wider. When the flow finally comes to a halt, you feel more spent than you have ever felt before. The corota doesn't even seem to give you a cursory look as they waddle off, their footfalls followed by the sound of an occasional wet impact as thick wads of spunk fall between their legs.";

Sniffing at the air with nose and tongue, the serpent creature smiles down at you in a way only a feral can. 'Thirsty from fight,' they hiss, diving between your legs greedily. In seconds, your labia and hips are covered in a mass of nonvenomous bites, the corota's many hands slapping at your hips as they seem to forget that you aren't a giant jug of fluid. Whether they beat you until terrified beyond control, or the rough abuse is one of your special buttons, you eventually give the corota their much desired drink. Not even bothering to give so much as a 'Thanks,' the serpent creature stomps away from you to slake the rest of their thirst elsewhere.";

Failing to see anything that catches their interest, the corota gives a snarl and turns around, raising both their tails high to bring down on you. Raising your arms to shield your face, you barely have the time to sigh in relief as each miss your arms and head by scant inches. You were so weak, for it to be seemingly beneath the serpent creature to even bother to make sure they've finished the job. The corota flaps their large wings to take to the skies, leaving you coated in a small layer of their dust.";

Your cheeks explode in pain as two great fangs sink into them, being used to inject a significant amount of poison into your mouth as the serpent-woman kisses you. You barely have the time or desire to consider that a half foot higher or lower, and you might not be in a position to ever complain again. When the fangs finally pull out, the corota smashes you roughly to the ground with a two handed overhead strike, and you're left there sputtering, and spitting blood and toxins from your mouth. While you've heard eating a rattlesnake's toxin is harmless, you aren't in the least bit willing to test that out with infected snake bites.";

Fortunately, they don't seem to strike anything vital before they get bored with you, crawling off your sore body and giving it a final, hard stomp to the gut before hurrying off.";

For a moment, it looks like the corota is going to allow you to do so, turning their back on you and beginning to walk away. Then you notice the small cloud of dust forming between their wings, too late to get out of the way or close your mouth before the corota sends the dust cloud straight into your open mouth with a quick flap of their wings. Gasping now in pain as the particles cling to your throat and insides of your breathing organs, you haven't the environmental awareness to notice them repeating the action again and again. Face going blue, you pass out to wake up some time later covered in the ochre dust, throat raw and demanding a drink soon.";

to say beatthecorota:

'Good fight,' it hisses respectfully. 'I give... for now.' With that, it turns and flaps it wings, taking to the air in a burst of dusty air. You cover your mouth and back away, waiting for the air to clear as it flies off in search of sport elsewhere.";

Any celebration at the nanites work is cut short as suddenly, with a great deal of pain, it feels like some thing's trying to force its way through your chest. In a burst of growth, you've got a second pair of arms resting about halfway down your body. The changes continue, moving lower as the muscles and bones in your lower half twist and crack, warning you of the coming changes in their own special, painful way.
