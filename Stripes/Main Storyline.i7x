'Welcome to Trevor Labs,' he says and extends a gloved hand to shake yours. 'I am Doctor Matthew Burnell, but most just call me Doctor Matt. Since I didn't hear any sounds of a scuffle from below, I presume Orthas let you in? She wouldn't do that with a crazed infectee, so it's nice to meet you.' ";
		if scenario is "Researcher":
			say "He focuses his gaze on you for a moment, then comments, 'You don't look nearly as lost and confused as most. Are you another researcher? Excellent. I'm looking into a cure for this plague, but my research is just in the beginning stages to be honest. There is something else of interest however...";
		else:
			say "He laughs a little, nervous and forced. 'Anyway, before you ask, no, we did not have anything to do with the nanite infestation. You didn't know it was nanites? Now you do. I have been studying them for some time since the grid went dark. I'm not much closer to a cure... but I did find something else of interest however,' he says, pausing for effect.";

[if humanity of Player < 80]In fact, I'd say you've already been pretty badly infected. Interesting... [end if]But now for the good news. As you develop resistances to the nanite infection and your system becomes stronger, I can redirect that growth to amazing, and planned, almost superhuman abilities,' he declares, sounding quite proud of himself. 'There's only one catch... I haven't had any test subjects to actually try it on so far. The creatures roaming around outside are too far gone to even talk to, and Orthas has to stay on post to guard the entrance.' The man gives you a calculating gaze, then adds in a persuasive tone, 'So how about you? You could [bold type]volunteer[roman type] for some tests, and we'll make you better than when you started. That'll help your chances to outlast this situation and what you might encounter outside and allow me to progress in my research. A fair deal, right?'";

Under his breath, the man murmurs to himself, 'Maybe the authorities will finally listen to me about delaying if I can show some first results. They simply must learn to understand that throwing more people at this will be worse than useless unless they know what they're getting into.'";

Sitting down in front of the screen, he types a few quick commands, then pulls up a folder containing what seems to be a lecture or presentation. 'As you might know, nanites are one of the most promising future technologies that scientists are trying to develop. Imagine being able to inject a payload of them and just eliminating any and all bacteria or viruses of the targeted type.' After a click, you can see an animation of cells on the screen, intermixed with red objects that are then attacked by microscopic machines and destroyed. 'From what I and everyone else knew, nanite systems like this are still years away from perfection, with exhaustive medical studies to do first. No one even imagined doing things like we're experiencing now.'";
	say "     'The central issue is control, you know. One can do only so much on the minuscule scale, and shoehorning any kind of memory and transmission capability leaves no room at all for anything else,' Dr. Matt explains, then pulls up recorded images from what must be one of the insanely expensive apparatuses in his lab here. On them, you see tiny metallic specs, some showing a basic hexagonal shape that are clustered together, others in a myriad of shapes slowly moving around, armed with grippers and feelers. The latter kind are spreading out to start working on an introduced sample of cells. 'Whoever thought up this nanite infection was a genius, if a criminally short-sighted one. You see, we're not dealing with one type of nanites, much rather dozens of them. Manipulators mainly, and shepherding them, the control units. This way each nanite doesn't need everything in it, but specialization and swarming allows astonishingly complex behavior!'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Dr. Matt goes through numerous short vids of the hexagonal nanites, linking together in a linear pattern initially, then splitting apart again and clumping in more random ways. Pointing at the first structure, he adds, 'From what I can tell, this is a receiver. They're the first thing that newly formed control nanites assemble to, but either there is no signal coming, or the first and only command these nanites are getting sets them to independent control. They recycle the structure soon after, and anything beyond this point is quite chaotic in its structure as the nanites grow and learn on their own. I need more data before I can give details on that.'";
	say "     Waving his hand in a casual way and indicating yourself, he adds, 'By the way, understanding these structures is how I can do my little adjustments to help you if you [bold type]volunteer[roman type]. I make use of what receivers there are at that moment, inserting a few of my own commands. Sadly, the remaining nanites seem to recognize the intrusion and quickly hunt down any clusters that hold foreign code, disassembling them. So the amount of change possible is quite limited. No easy cure for the nanite plague that way, I'm afraid.'";

	say "     Dr. Matt takes a deep breath, then turns the visor of his helmet your way and waves at the lab around you both. 'I was here when it started actually. With critical deadlines to meet for one of my projects, I was doing an all-nighter. Then morning came and... I heard an alarmingly loud crash from downstairs, followed by other noises. Of course I couldn't simply go and check it out since I was in the class 4 isolation lab. It became obvious that a fight was going on when I heard the gunshots during my airlock procedure, but by the time the outer door finally opened, all was quiet again. I feared the worst and ran towards the lobby while still in my suit, only to find a wholly different scene than I had imagined. Oh, the room was thrashed thoroughly to be sure, but the huge draconic creature that was pinning our night security guard to the floor wasn't interested in actually harming him at all.'";
	say "     'Imagine my surprise at seeing what appeared to be a car-sized quadrupedal reptile on top of Mr. Janakos, engaged in sexual intercourse. A fascinating sight for sure, seeing that the creature didn't seem to belong to any natural genus, having six limbs in all, four legs and two wings. Also, it was sodomizing its human partner with a significantly over-sized penis without apparent harm to his well-being. In fact, he was moaning in arousal from the treatment.' Dr. Matt shrugs a little as he recounts this, his tone of voice relaxed and neutral, showing that he's more interested in factual matters than judging. 'Unable to affect the creature by myself in any way, the only thing I could do was observe, dictating some whispered notes into this suit's audio pickups. After the creature eventually deposited its seed, it wandered off, leaving me free to come to its groaning victim's help.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Dr. Matt recounts rushing downstairs with a large medkit he grabbed from a wall holder at the lab entrance, only to find the security guard in almost perfect health, the last signs of bruises and cuts vanishing before his very eyes. Yet then a kind of rash started spreading over his skin, with it becoming black and scaly. Hastily rushing his patient upstairs to the lab, Dr. Matt examined him, which the organized researcher captured on video too. A moment later, you're watching a computer screen, showing the image of a naked and Greek-American man lying on a stretcher. He's quite well built, broad shouldered and strong, and you can see the text 'Test Subject A: Orthus Janakos' in the corner of the screen. Over the next several minutes, you see him transform into the anthro dragoness you know as Orthas, all of which is narrated by Dr. Matt - even though you could have done well without being told just which bone breaking is responsible for what crunch.";
	say "     'I knew something had to be done to find the cause of this contagion, and a cure, so I went right back to work afterwards. As it turned out, nanites are the culprits here and they have wide-ranging transformative, as well as libido increasing, effects. I was quite lucky that I had no time to take off my suit in that first rush towards the lobby, otherwise I might very well be just another of the unfortunate victims of the nanite plague.' The suited man points to a large security window with embedded wire in the back of his lab, and the airlock beside it. 'To remain unaffected and be able to work on researching the nanites, I had to re-purpose the isolation lab as living quarters. It is somewhat amusing that a room that originally held samples of virulent diseases now has become my refuge and the one place I can take off this suit. Also, I really have to recommend Orthas for her sense of duty. Without her to keep guard even after her transformation, I would never have been able to remain here.'";

to say DrMattTalk3:
	say "     The suited man looks up at you as you bring up connecting with the world outside of the city, glancing at you through his glasses and nodding. 'Yes, I do still have contact with a colleague in the CDC, Dr. Sutton. As luck will have it, the Trevor Labs facility is part of the shielded communications network that connects a number of selected sites of bio-safety level 4 in case of emergencies. If only Greg and I could have convinced the authorities that they have to delay the planned surge of troops into the city!' He distractedly moves to stroke through his gray hair, only to have his gloved fingers bump against the Plexiglas screen of the helmet. Lowering his hand with an annoyed grunt, Dr. Matt makes a frustrated throwing-away gesture.";
	say "     'They just won't listen! Sending more troops will only expand the ranks of the infected unless they're properly prepared. And for that, we need more research!' The man focuses on yourself with an intense expression that speaks of his desperate need for progress, and the frustration of a scientist at being rushed. He adds in a grumbling tone, 'The infighting out there is almost as bad as the beasts out on the streets here. Politicians screaming for something to be done yesterday, generals drawing in what local forces they can and preparing for a Hail-Mary push to 'overwhelm the beasts', with those who understand anything about the situation in the middle and ignored by both. Please, help me get some results so we can make them listen.'";

Section 2 - Quests

to DrMattSampleQuestStart:
	say "     As you offer your help, Dr. Matt looks at you through the clear screen of his suit helmet and smiles eagerly. 'Splendid! I had hoped you might be willing to assist. To get a handle on this whole situation here, I need more data - and fast, otherwise the military might just move in unprepared in their usual impatience. Can you imagine the scale of what a disaster that would be? Chaos and casualties in the thousands, that's for sure.' The doctor's expression darkens as he says those words, telling you that he's genuinely concerned about the outcome. From what you've learned of the nanite infection so far, you can't help but agree about his worries, as even trained soldiers would surely succumb quickly if they went up against the infected without any protection from transformation. Close quarters fighting against infected who just shrug off most wounds after a few seconds isn't to be taken lightly.";
	say "     Raising one hand as if to nervously brush over his graying hair, Matt stops himself before he hits the helmet, letting his gloved fingers drop with a frown. 'Anyways, since we only have this limited amount of time, I would suggest you move quickly. I have been trying to convince the military to delay its [']surge['], but without data to support my warnings, they're easily ignored. Please come over here for a moment with me,' he says, then walks to a nearby terminal and sits down in front of it. He opens up a folder named 'observed specimens', which contains a whole row of still images from surveillance cams. 'Thankfully the exterior security system's cameras do have battery backup, so they've captured footage of some interesting creatures since the outbreak.

Good, this will be quite useful in my further research. You see, during the infrequent lulls in creature activity out on the streets, Orthas sometimes goes out hunting to gather supplies we need. During one such excursion, she spotted something interesting: A singular creature, an anthro cervine by her description, which showed a divergence of the usual behavior pattern seen in most infected. You must understand, one of the standard impulses of any carrier is the drive to spread the infection, but this 'deer woman' neither had any further members of her species around, nor did she approach Orthas or try to turn her. I can't help but wonder why that may have been. An incomplete or recent transformation possibly, or this person is at least somewhat resisting the infection's mental impact.'";

He shakes himself out of that a moment later, then focuses on you again, 'No matter which, I would like to interview and study her. Could you please try to find this creature and bring her here? If safely achievable, of course.' With that said, the man pulls a printout of a city map from his stacks of research papers and lays it out on the table in front of you. Glancing at the piece of paper, you find yourself reminded of just how much the nanite outbreak has changed in the city, as you know that many of the streets, buildings and landmarks do not exist anymore in their old states. 'Orthas said she was about here, two blocks east, when she saw the deer, followed by the woman fleeing to the north.'

'Please just let the doctor just do his thing and don't try start any funny business, alright? He's our only hope, you know, and absolutely must stay in his suit.' Susan frowns at those words and squeals, 'Hey! I'm not an animal! Looked in the mirror lately, lady?!' You quickly step in and smooth things over between them, ensuring Orthas that Susan will be on her best behavior and putting an arm on the doe's arm to lead her to the stairs.

'Welcome to the Trevor Labs, young lady. I am Doctor Matthew Burnell, but most just call me Doctor Matt. Hopefully your trip here wasn't too stressful?' Susan gapes at him, with something about being presented with a fully human, older male making her shyness about her form bubble up again. She moves her hands to cover herself and haltingly replies, 'I - um - it was okay. So - you're a real doctor?' 'Certainly, my dear. You don't need to be shy.

Finally, he gives her some fresh food and water, then comes back to you as Susan is busy eating. 'She is a quite remarkable specimen that could help me understand many details about the nanites that are still a mystery. You have my thanks for bringing Susan in. Now, the number of tests that will need to be performed with her are quite extensive, so I have offered her a place to stay here for the intermediate duration. Could you please go and tell Orthas that we need a bed for the young woman?'";

I'm still a bit worried about her instincts flaring up you know. That girl is hung like a donkey and a cock like that sometimes has a mind of its own,' the dragoness says, then shrugs. 'Fine, I guess the doc knows what he's doing. Please hold my post for a little while, I'll go grab one of the emergency cots. The company bought a bunch of those when we had that audit last year and everyone was working overtime around the clock.' With that said, she unlocks the stairwell and vanishes upstairs, then returns some minutes later with a portable cot that she carries to the lab.

Fascinating, that the nanites mix and match like this, creating gender configurations not usually seen in vertebrates.' Picking up a tablet, he taps its screen and angles it so you can see what must be a microscopic closeup of a sample from Susan, with countless numbers of identical nanomachines.

With that said, the doctor shepherds you over to his equipment and takes a series of samples from all over your body, then makes you document your physical state in front of the camera, up to and including [if player is male]getting hard and having your cock measured[else if player is female]spreading your folds and showing them off[else]some closeups of your genderless crotch[end if].

Dr. Matt makes Susan and yourself take position between the cameras, then asks her to brush her fingers over your arm lightly, followed by longer periods of contact as nothing much happens afterwards. 'Interesting,' the older man says thoughtfully, then raises a digital voice recorder to capture some notes. 'Simple physical touch appears to be insufficient to facilitate transmission of the nanites in the subjects. My hypothesis for this is that the devices are closely integrated in the host body, with no capability of independent movement on the macro scale intended in their design. This might explain the current absence of grey goo scenario effects, despite the supposed degradation of programming and chaotic evolution of nanite strains. Proceeding to next test phase.'";

By the time her hand moves away again, there is no trace of any missing hair left. 'The rapid regeneration of missing fur indicates that nanites must be involved in the process. It is simply to fast to be anything else. Retaining most of this as sample 27A,' the doctor dictates as he pushes Susan's clump of fur into a labelled plastic baggy. Before sealing it though, he fishes out a few hairs again, then bids you to hold out your arm and places the strands on it. Before everyone's eyes, the strands crumble away in barely an eye-blink, with what appears to be dust falling onto your skin and merging with it. For a few seconds, it appears as if you'd grow a fur not unlike the deer herm's, but the small patch spreads only about two inches before being pushed back and rapidly returning to your previous form.";
		say "     'Presence of nanites in detached material confirmed. They appear to register that they are no longer connected to the main host and abandon all efforts to retain local structures once a new host becomes available. Nanite number in test appears to be insufficient to facilitate a widespread change in the second test subject against a dominant native strain.' Dr. Matt proceeds to go through similar tests with various bodily fluids, dictating the results as he goes along: saliva ('moderate infectiveness, increasing with prolonged contact due to suspected nanite migration'), blood ('surprisingly light infectiveness'), pee ('skipped due to test subject refusal'), then finally sexual fluids. As he dabs a swab from Susan's pussy only very lightly against your forearm, this starts a rapid spread of deer fur around the point of contact, almost reaching your wrist before it too is pushed back.";

There appears to be a large concentration of nanites in test subjects reproduction system. This might be intended to capitalize on natural fluid exchange behavior of hosts to facilitate nanite spread! It is too perfect, too tailor-made for maximum transmission capability while hard to detect to be a random mutation of the nanite code! I believe this must be part of the original design!' Raising his gaze after staring into nothingness for a few seconds, Dr. Matt beams at both Susan and yourself and adds, 'Thank you both! This is a puzzle piece that I was missing! Whoever thought these device up was clever, quite clever. It can't be denied that the nanites do have an effect on the libido of the infected, and I was wondering why they all do this.' As he says this, he nods to Susan, who has been casually stroking her cock a little out of boredom while he worked on his tests, with her quickly pulling her hand away, now that she's been put on the spot.";
		say "     'It's the second half of this system!' Dr. Matt says triumphantly, pointing at the swab. 'You see, the nanites gravitate towards the genitals, to ride along with semen or other fluids exchanged! This is so much more elegant than wasting energy to allow the nanites their own movement. Imagine the panic that globs of nanite goo crawling up to people to infect them, or - god forbid - nanite injector moskitos would have caused in a regular city. No, this method stealthily, quietly transmits the nanites. And upping the host's lust speeds up the process! Simply genius!' Then his expression falls, with a frown showing the many wrinkles in Dr. Matt's face. 'Though the designer's pride at their work must have been followed by a harsh fall. What's going on out there in the streets is far from what these nanites seem to be designed to do. Or maybe they are - I'd guess it's either malicious intent, a horrific oversight, or sabotage in this nanite infection system that is the root of our current catastrophe. The intended nudge to the libido seems to have been maxed out, to surpass almost all ability of control by the host.'";
