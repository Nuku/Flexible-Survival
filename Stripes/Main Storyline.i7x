Chapter 3 - Alternate Drop-off Points

instead of entering the Confession Booth while "Beach" is listed in ndmlist and nanite density monitor is owned:
	say "     Stepping into the confessional, you ask the priestess if you may place one of the nanite density monitors atop the belltop.";
	say "     'Ah, those who cling to science are always seeking to explain that which is miraculous.  They, always able to find answers to their questions, never stop to truly appreciate the fact that it is still a miracle.  This is because they seek answers to the wrong questions in life,' she says serenely.  'But we will allow you to place your device, in thanks to the science which first brought about the nanites.  While some of the elements of this miracle were man-made, everything was put into place for a grander purpose - this great rebirth of the world.  You and those at Zephyr would do best to accept this truth rather than to seek greed from it.'";

	say "     She signals for an altar boy to come and assist you with your task, escorting you up the bell tower.  As you climb the tower behind him, you chat with red panda altar [']boy['], learning that his name is Peter.  With his fluffy tail raised to keep it out of the dust, you are able to get a good peak under his short robe the whole way up if you like.  Peter, despite his shorter, five foot height is clearly an adult with a mature body with a slight pudge.  He does have a tight little ass and an ample sheath and balls which you can plainly see under the white cloth.  You talk with him, discussing what it's been like for each of you since the outbreak (though you edit your own version considerably).";
	say "     Once at the top, it takes a few knocks to get the warped hatch to the bell chamber open.  You can't help to snag a final peek under the red panda's robe before you both enter the top of the tower, noting that his cock's begun to poke free of its sheath.  The bell chamber is dusty and the bell system is in disrepair, clearly having fallen out of use even before the outbreak.  Peter explains that the church was unable to pay to maintain the bells for the last few years, so no one ever comes up here and that your device should be safe enough.  Opening one of the outer windows, you place the black box on the wooden ledge with the Zephyr logo turned to the wall to further hide it and turn it on.  After a brief pause, there is a whirring sound as the screw bolts dig into the wood, locking it firmly into place.";

	say "     With that chore done, you pause for a moment, wondering if you want to thank Peter in a more personal way for his help.  Shall you try to sex up the red panda?";
	if the player consents:
		say "     As he moves to head back down the hatch, you move in close to the red panda and slide your arms around his waist, running your hands over his tummy and down to his groin.  You whisper in his ear that you'd like to really thank him for all his help.  He moans softly and mumbles something about not giving into the base urges, so you slip up the front of his robe and fondle his sheath directly, pleased to see that his cock's slipped further from it.  You tell him that you think he's very cute and that you only want to show how much you appreciate his help, all while sliding your fingertips across his stiffening member.  He releases a soft [']wah['] of pleasure and pulls his robe up further, blushing redder under his fur.";

His paws run over your body as you hold his penis in position and sink your pussy down around it.  The wah releases a wah of pleasure as your cunt envelops his maleness and you start riding up and down it.  Despite his small stature, he's got an impressive eight inch cock that pulse and throbs inside you as you fuck.  His nimble paws caress your breasts and tease your nipples as the russet furred fellow squirms in delight beneath you.  You moan in pleasure as he releases another, louder wah as he cums hard, blasting his thick seed into your pussy and up into your womb.";

Without removing your hand from his cock, you guide the red panda onto all fours, smiling at how his tail arches up and twitches as he presents himself.  Deciding not to tarry too long in case someone comes to check on you both, you line up your cock with his tight pucker and sink slowly into him[if cock length of player > 16].  He slaps both paws over his muzzle as he releases a long, muffled wah as you slowly push your massive meat into him, bulging his furry tummy outwards to accommodate it[otherwise if cock length of player > 8].  He slaps a paw over his muzzle as he releases a muffled wah as you slowly push your large meat into him, stuffing the little fellow full[otherwise].  He releases another wah of pleasure as you slowly push your meat into him[end if].  Peter's shaft throbs in your hand, dribbling precum onto the dusty floor as you fuck him before eventually leaving a large, messy stain of red panda cum there as you blast your own load into him.";

You stifle a moan as he moves his cock into position at your back door, sinking himself slowly into your tight rear.  His stiff cock spreads you open gently as he starts thrusting while a paw moves around to stroke your [if cocks of player > 1]shafts[otherwise]shaft[end if].  His soft fur rubs against your back as his pudgy belly rests atop you and his plump balls slap against you with each thrust.  You go at this for several minutes until the red panda presses his muzzle against your neck and releases a muffled wah of pleasure, cumming hard inside you.  You can feel his hot seed filling your ass and your climax hits as well, blasting your hot seed across the dusty floor.";
		otherwise:
			say "     Lacking any sexual organs of your own, you drop to your knees in front of the red panda and stuff his cock into your mouth.  You tease your tongue across his leaking shaft and eagerly start sucking him off.  He rubs a paw over your head as the other covers his muzzle to muffle a wah of pleasure.  You work his penis with your mouth, tongue and lips until finally he can't take any more and Peter releases another muffled wah as he cums hard, flooding your mouth with his tasty load.";
		say "     Your quick fun over, he gives you a kiss and nuzzles you before leading you back down into the church.  As he descends, he tries his best to wipe his dusty robe clean.  Once downstairs, he gives you another quick kiss before dashing off to the confessional.";
	otherwise:
		say "     You decide to just speak your thanks to the red panda and follow him back down the steps, pleased with yourself at your ingenuity in placing it here.";

ndmLisa is a truth state that varies.  ndmLisa is normally false.

instead of conversing the Lisa while "Red Light District" is listed in ndmlist and nanite density monitor is owned and ndmLisa is false:
	say "     You decide to ask Lisa if it would be okay to put the detector on top of her porn store.  It might be as tall as some of the other buildings, but it would certainly be a safer spot, so you're willing to give it a try.  As you start to bring up the topic, the mousetaur gets very upset.  'Zephyr?  You're helping those greedy bastards?  I've been hearing stuff about them and you shouldn't get involved with them.  They're bad news and it's going to get messy when the infected people around here have had enough of their money-grubbing scientists.'";

instead of conversing Alex while "High Rise District" is listed in ndmlist and nanite density monitor is owned:
	say "     Looking around Alex's high rise condo, you decide to ask him if it would be alright to install the device from Zephyr on his balcony.  'Hmmm... Zephyr?  Aren't they some kind of R&D company?  Are they looking into this problem?  Sure!  It'll be good to know we're helping to fix this mess.  So, what does it do?' he asks in a spurt of manic energy.  You do your best to explain what little you know as you head out with him onto the balcony and find a suitable spot next to his now-useless air conditioner.  Activating the device, there is a whirr as the screws drill into the concrete, securing it in place.  You head back inside, thanking the ferrety lawyer for his help.";
