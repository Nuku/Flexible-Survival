Section 1 - City Hospital

City Hospital is a room. It is fasttravel.

The description of City Hospital is "     The exterior of the hospital is quite disheveled.  It seems like a large number of people were here when the outbreak started.  You can guess that several people, initially surprised by their changes, came to the hospital, leading to the infection of everyone inside, patiend and doctor alike.  You have to wonder if it is wise to investigate here further.  But looking up at the hospital, you can see several rooms in one corner on the third floor is illuminated.  And not with the dim light of flashlights and camping lanterns, nor the flicking flames of candles or fires, but the full, smooth light of electricity.[line break]     Inside the lobby, there are further signs of the chaos of transformations while doctors tried to figure out what was happening.  The waiting area is presently clear of people and creatures, through there is a lot of scattered clothes, as well as gurneys, crutches and other medical items.  In some cases, these are piled up in an attempt to barricade the doors.  It appears that searching will have another difficulty to it, as you won't be able to simply follow the hospital floor plans to that corner.[line break]     From the shadows of one hall, you catch the glimpse of a strange, mishapen form before it slips further into the shadows of the hospital.  It moved quite unevenly on its two malformed legs.  Perhaps this place will be even more disturbing than the others you've searched before and you may want to rethink coming here.";
