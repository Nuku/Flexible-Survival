Section 1 - City Hospital


hospnav is a number that varies.
hospstairs is a number that varies.


City Hospital is a room. It is fasttravel.

The description of City Hospital is "     The exterior of the hospital is quite disheveled.  It seems like a large number of people were here when the outbreak started.  You can guess that several people, initially surprised by their changes, came to the hospital, leading to the rampant infection of everyone inside, patient and doctor alike.  You have to wonder if it is wise to investigate here further[if hospquest > 0].  But looking up at the hospital, you can see several rooms in one corner on the third floor are fully illuminated.  And not with the dim glow of the emergency lighting, nor the flicking flames of candles or fires, but the full, smooth light of electricity[end if].[line break]     Inside the lobby, there are further signs of the chaos of transformations while staff tried to figure out what was happening.  The waiting area is presently clear of people and creatures, through there is a lot of scattered clothes, as well as gurneys, crutches and other medical items.  In some cases, these are piled up in an attempt to barricade the doors.  It appears that searching will have another difficulty to it, as you won't be able to simply follow the hospital floor plans[if hospquest > 0] to that corner[end if].[line break]     From the shadows of one hall, you catch the glimpse of a strange, mishapen form before it slips further into the shadows of the hospital, away from the emergency lighting.  It moved quite unevenly on its two malformed legs.  Perhaps this place will be even more disturbing than the others you've searched before and you may want to rethink coming here.";

Hospital Halls is a door. "To the north are a pair of double-doors leading into the hospital.". It is dangerous. 

North of City Hospital is Hospital Halls.

Those timestamped as the later ones even start commenting on the strange frequency of such occurences the preliminary examiner's found that evening.  The last one talks about a patient with growing hair spreading over his body along with the stiffening of his fingers and nails.  It ends with the doctor's rough scrawls about the patient being hung like a horse, that it's so good and how she's letting him take her like his mare so she can properly test it.";

The description of Doctor Mouse is "     Dr Mouse is a small, white mouse with red eyes and a pink nose and ears.  He's only about four feet tall, and that's to the top of his ears.  He's dressed in a white labcoat that goes almost to the floor with his rodent-like feet and thin tail poking out from underneath it.  He is busily working away in the lab, always scurrying about for equipment or checking on one of his many experiments.";

This creature stares at you with blood red eyes as you are both frozen in surprise.  You start to raise your weapon slowly, but the mouse smiles happily and claps his hands together with glee.";

As the mouse moves around the work table, you can see his head barely clears it at all, only about four feet tall at the ears.  He grabs a wooden stool and pulls it over, scraping it across the floor.  As he climbs up to get a seat, he adds, 'you should call me Doctor Mouse, I guess.  A new name for a new me,' he chuckles as he scrambles into the seat with some effort and motions for you to pull one up as well.";

I've not been able to leave here since the infection struck.  Far too dangerous for a little guy like me out there.  And so much to do here, studying the nanite infection.  It has such a capacity for healing.'  He starts to babble a little, perhaps from being isolated in here.";

There are a variety of strains, as you have no doubt seen.  Most strains are in conflict with one another, though some appear to be able to live in symbiosis.";

There have also been a wide range of, for lack of a better term, evolutionary traits that the nanites introduce to increase their host's potential success in this regard.  Universally though, the nanites bring with them an increased rate of healing.";

For example, the human knee, while very functional and a key component, is very shoddily constructed.  But everything is interconnected and works as a whole.'";

I'm quite certain that the nanites, by constantly working and repairing their hosts, are keeping them from experiencing the deleterious effects of their body's changes.  I fear, if they were somehow removed or shut down suddenly, many of the hosts would no longer be able to sustain themselves.  Or at least at this stage of development, perhaps.  It's hard to say.  So much of this is based off observational assumptions.  I need more hard data.'";

He smiles up at you, twitching his whiskers.  'And that is why I am so glad to see you.  I am in need of more equipment to analyze the nanites.'  He waves to his lab.
