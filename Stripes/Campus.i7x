Looking up, you spot a pack of gorillas in football gear charging at you, some running, but most moving on all fours. Looking over at the one who called out, you see him and another gorilla moving in fast outside of his line of sight. You signal with a quick tilt of your head and then throw the ball off to his right, outside of the would-be interceptor's reach. Snagging the ball, the player makes a run for it with the ball cradled to his chest. The others, seeing the completed pass, turn and charge after him, saving you from getting trampled.";

to say campusdesc:
	say "     Tenvale College stretches out before you. The institution is wedged into a section of the city that has grown denser around it, giving the fairly open and green campus a refreshing contrast to the rest of the surroundings. Renowned for its strong sports program, you know that there are multiple large sporting locations on the edge of the campus, even though you can't see them from right here, due to various other buildings all around. To the northwest, northeast, east, and west are walkways that lead to other parts of the campus, cutting through the grassy expanse around you. Another pathway leads straight north, to a fountain where you see multiple students hanging out, clearly on free time.";
	say "     Since it's summer, the number of students on campus is much lower than during the school year, but there are still a number of people around from the activity you can see. Certainly, there's the usual piles of scattered clothes and messy cum stains strewn about on the lawns, but the immediately visible residents appear to have taken their transformations in stride, seemingly going about their normal business as they would have before. An interesting approach certainly, given that on the campus parking lot to your south, several overturned cars lie scattered and strewn about by one or another of the bigger creatures roaming the city, and you can make out damage to this or that building as well.";

to say campuseastdesc:

Nevertheless though the place still smells like sex, which is to be expected. To your west you see the entrance to Tenvale College with its parking lots and everything. To your southeast you see frats in the distance and upon closer examination spot a sign that says 'Greek Street'. You muse that it's aptly named. To the northeast is a different set of buildings, specifically what looks to be the housing district. Just like the fraternities, it too has a justifiable name, 'Dorm Street'. Lastly, to your northwest you spot another pathway that leads somewhere else.";

to say greekdesc:
	say "     As suspected of a street with nothing but fraternities and sororities it is littered with cups, underwear, panties, and all sorts of trash. Beyond that you can also spot a few people passed out drunk on the grass in front of a lot of the buildings. While you'd love to explore all the various sororities and fraternities, you have no clue which ones are safe to enter. So, personally you feel that it is better for you to have a look around the campus to see if you can find information on the various groups at the college.";

It appears that someone has tried to scratch out the r in dorm so as to make it say Dom, something that makes you chuckle out loud before you direct your attention elsewhere. Compared to the rest of the campus, Dorm Street is a lot cleaner, only noticing maybe one or two pieces of stray clothing on the grass. The only building here that catches your attention is to your east, a dorm that seems to be lived in, if the lights in the windows say anything. If you wish to leave the area, you could always head back southwest, back to the walkway you came in from.";

First and foremost you can spot random people talking happily amongst each other, not acting upon the baser urges that everyone else in the city have already acted upon. Next, there are various cork boards with club recruitment posters pinned to them. While they could be old versions, upon closer look you notice that they've been redrawn to include the new looks of each clubs, an example being the football team's wolfmen. Beyond that you can see that various rooms are occupied by people but figure that it'd be best to find someone you know who has a room rather than randomly searching each and every room. If you wish to leave you could always return to Dorm Street by going west.";

Plastered all over the walls are lewd pictures of naked women and men, however upon closer examination you spot posters of male couples fucking that look to be recent acquisitions. You muse that Richard's recent goat changes appear to have enhanced his various desires. Turning your attention from the posters you notice there's various items on the floor from a football to stray jock straps to even a stray dildo.

While there is one or two couples having sex out in the open, most of the people are just sitting and chatting with their friends. The fountain itself has random gunk in it but it looks like the campus staff clean it on a daily basis, if the person with the uniform and bucket says anything.

But then again to be honest, they [italic type]are[roman type] trying to recruit new students. Though you swear that one of those posters is new and is encouraging sex. Ignoring the weird ass posters for a second, the administration area is rather bland otherwise. There is a desk in the center of the room with ropes making a line for people to stand in.

On the ground, there is a mix of various species, but as mentioned earlier it's primarily the location for people with flight. If you look upward you can see some of the students flying up high to a location that you have no idea of. Perhaps you can look around campus for information on what's up there, although you might know someone who has an idea of what is, maybe someone who is kind enough to tell you.";

Rather instead there appears to be a lot of different sports equipment all over the place as well as some people who look to be studying with their friends. The explanation for this is very much straightforward. For one, to the southwest is the location of the athletic departments, which is marked by a sign reading 'Athletic Street'. In the distance you can see many people practicing sports but you are not close enough to see exactly what. Secondly, to the northwest is the location of all the lecture halls, the street aptly named 'Lecture Street'. If you wished to go elsewhere then you can either head northeast to another walkway or east to the campus entrance.";

There are multiple buildings all over the place but you're not entirely sure where to go. It may be best to look around the campus for members of the various teams and see if you can gain information about the various members that way. After all you don't think you'd want to accidentally walk into an area while people are practicing and possibly get tackled to the ground.";

to say lecturestreetdesc:

Rather, the area appears to solely be for the students to hang out and study or go to class. Although, despite that, it is difficult to tell which lecture hall teaches what, so it'd be best if you looked around campus for other students in order to figure out where to go. It may also help to possibly enroll at some point for other classes.";

You see students sitting at various tables, studying for classes it appears. Though, by the noise of moaning in the background and what sounds like balls slapping against someone's ass there is more than just class work being done.

Of course, on top of that you can spot some soon-to-be students filling out admissions paperwork on the grass, as the administrations building is northwest of here. To your west you can hear running water, which you expect to be the fountain. To the southeast is another pathway while to the southwest is the entrance to the college.";
