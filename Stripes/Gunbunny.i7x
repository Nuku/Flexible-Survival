				if pistol is owned:
					say "     Your thoughts gradually become more confused and jumbled as your mind slips away. The grip of your pistol in your paw-glove hands is a strong comfort, feeling very right to you and no other weapon will do. Forgetting about the bunker, you end up setting up a new den for yourself, choosing to build a cozy burrow in the woodlands that's popped up inside the city. It's quite concealed and you stock it with more guns and ammo for added protection as well as food and other supplies, living like some crazy bunny-eared survivalist.";
					say "     During your outings into the city proper, you often enjoy some target practice, picking some hapless creature to chase around while shooting at them. Being dangerously armed and having speed and mobility on your side, these are often quite one-sided battles. On one of these hunts though, you come across a squad of soldiers and they prove to be much more fun. You enjoy chasing them down, running and gunning to repeatedly break up the group so you can try to pick them off one by one.";
					say "     The hunt is long and excitingly dangerous as the soldiers are also armed as well, though you're able to gain a quick advantage by leading one here and there to seek cover in places where you know some creature it hiding from the firefight. Many of creatures in this area have learned to avoid the sounds of gunfire, knowing it means you or another of the gun-totting bunnies is out hunting. These mutants are more than happy to have someone to snuggle up with while they wait out the gun fight. You can't help but grin at one point while pausing to reload you're also able to peek in and see a transformed soldier getting fucked senseless by some feline.";
					say "     The next few you take down are trickier, as they keep trying to regroup and cover themselves. Eventually though you're able to isolate and pick off their leader. The next time your charge breaks them up, a few scatter and run, becoming easy pickings for you. You whittle down the remaining squad until you're left with one last soldier.";
					say "     The final soldier has grabbed several guns from his fallen squad-mates and makes a valiant, desperate last stand. Your gunfight is long and heated, exchanging fire and moving back and forth from cover to cover as one or the other of you tries to outflank the other. Eventually though, you're able to finally close in on him between reloads. With a bunny leap, you pounce onto him and bear him to the ground, ending your fight with a kiss.";
					say "     After a moment of resistance, he's helping you to pull of his clothes as your tongues wrestle together. You grope and fondle each other while kissing passionately, and soon you're fucking like bunnies. Quite literally so as the soldier transforms into a bunny-eared and fluffy-tailed [if Player is herm]herm like yourself[else if Player is male]girl[else]studmuffin[end if]. After the long hunt and gunfight, you know [if Player is not male]he's[else]she's[end if] the one for you and now you have a sexy mate to share your warm, fortified burrow you soon hope to be filling with gun-happy bunny children.";
				else:
					say "     Your thoughts gradually become more confused and jumbled as your mind slips away. You wander off into the city as if looking for something, though you don't quite know what. Your bunny speed and leaping lets you avoid most trouble. You fidget with your gloved paws often, something just not feeling right about them or you.";
					say "     Eventually, you come across the scene of what was probably a confrontation between some monster and some soldiers. There's gooey stains and scraps of camouflaged clothing scattered about along with lots of other military gear. Given how that's all still here, you can tell the fight was rather recent. Suspecting that the infected soldiers or the creature that did this to them (or both) could still be around, you know it'd be safest to leave right now, but your focus keeps returning to a rifle.";
					say "     It's just laying there. On the ground. Right over there. Where you could. just. take. it. Take it. Take it. TAKE IT! NOW! NOWNOWNOWNOWNOW!";
					say "     Your internal monologue overwhelms any restraint and you rush over to the gun, grabbing it excitedly. Your paws close around it naturally, finding it to be a perfect fit despite the altered shape of your hands and digits. You start breathing fast and heavy, a rush of wild excitement making you giggle a little. It just feels so good to finally have a gun in your hands.";
					say "     With caution forgotten, you fire several shots, first into the air and then into various targets. You're soon picking off smaller and more distant objects as you quickly get a feel for the rifle and find your aim with it. You giggle again, sling the rifle over your shoulder and start searching the rest of the scattered gear, gathering up a bunch of it[if Player is female]. You even make yourself a ragged camo bikini from some of the scraps around you[else]. You even pull on a pair of torn camo pants that are now little more than ragged shorts[end if]. Thus equipped, you head off into the city as another crazy, gun-totting bunny.";
			else:
				if pistol is owned:
					say "     Your thoughts gradually become more confused and jumbled as your mind slips away. The grip of your pistol in your paw-glove hands is a strong comfort, providing some focus for you. You end up wandering the city for a while before coming across an armed pack of mutants. They're a disjointed jumble of creatures like yourself and have banded together for mutual protection and fun. Fortunately, you've come across them while camping rather than roving for supplies or mates, so you're able to meet with them. And having a gun certainly helps, providing enough intimidation for them to see you as more than another victim. You join up with their ragtag band, becoming another bandit in their pack.";
					say "     You stick with them for a while, enjoying the life of taking what you want from weaker foes, be it supplies, sex or both. The numbers in this band fluctuates often, members being lost when other creatures steal them as makes or killed during raids, but others are recruited as well. The bandits fall under particularly hard times when the military comes through, as they're better equipped and trained to deal with your untrained tactics. Add to that the removal of the weaker, semi-sane citizens who made for common prey or recruits and the group dwindles.";
					say "     Thankfully though, you and a few others make it through this period of hard times, finally able to make an escape past the military lines a few weeks after the military campaign. Out of the city, your band roams the countryside, attacking lone travelers and small towns, taking supplies and leaving infected citizens and pregnancies in your wake. As before, you pick up and lose some along the way, eventually moving you up to being [if level of Player >= 10]in charge[else if level of Player >= 5]the second in command[else]a respected senior of the group[end if].";
				else:
					say "     Your thoughts gradually become more confused and jumbled as your mind slips away. You wander off into the city, feeling that something is missing though you know not what. You get caught by a band of roaming bandits, a medley of half-infected mutants who do what they please. You end up robbed, fucked and are left stripped of all supplies and dignity as you're used repeatedly.";
					say "     Vowing vengeance, you stalk the group, always keeping tabs on them from a safe distance. Revenge is now foremost in your previously confused mind, providing a kind of hate-fueled focus. But you also know there's little you can do against their strength and numbers. If only you had a gun, your mind tells you as you watch one of them on a half-hearted patrol while the others make camp in some ruins for the evening. And with that thought, you spring into action, taking down the lone guard to get his gun.";
					say "     Once you've got his rifle, probably taken from a fallen soldier, things change and you're the hunter and they're the hunted. You harry and harass the group over the course the next several days, disrupting their attempts to do anything and picking members off one or two at a time. The whole thing is very exciting for you and sometimes you can't help having some extra fun with a bandit you capture. Eventually, the whole group is either dead, captured or given over to horny monsters for them to remake into their playthings.";
					say "     After this, you have no real idea what to do with yourself, your mind and your past gone and your new goal over. Eventually, some time after the military rescue is over, you leave the city. You become a wandering gunman, hiring yourself out to towns to deal with mutant bandits or just to someone looking for some revenge against raiders. You get paid in money, supplies, ammo or sex - though the last two for a preference.";
		else:
			if Player is pure:
				say "     When the soldiers come through to rescue survivors, you're teased a bit about your new bunny form, but manage to take it in stride[if pistol is owned]. Having to turn over your pistol though when you get to the processing camp? Now that was tough. It took quite the effort of will, even with armed soldiers there, to leave it in their possession[end if]. The scientists who examine you show little interest in your bunny features, falsely accepting that you've only been subject to minor changes to get those ears, tail and strange paw-gloves.";
				if HP of Doctor Matt >= 12 and HP of Doctor Matt < 100:
					say "     You instead choose to talk to some of the soldiers. Now, while most are understandably standoffish, you do find a couple who're willing to talk about guns with you. As you talk with them, it seems you knew more about guns than you'd have thought. Your mind convinces you that you must've picked this stuff up here and there from stuff you've read or watched in the past. Your new gun buddies arrange a little practice fun, letting you get in on a shooting contest at the range they've set up. And while you don't remember having used one of their rifles before, you pick it up very quickly and are soon [if level of Player >= 15]shooting almost on par with the best of them[else if level of Player >= 8]scoring at about their average[else]scoring nearly as well as they are[end if].";
					say "     Having impressed your new friends, they arrange another session a few days later. You fare a little better this second time, quickly getting back to your previous level, letting you score much better overall across all the targets. It seems you have an unexpected spectator though, the common soldiers surprised to find an officer standing quietly among the range staff. Now whether he got wind of it in advance or if someone spotted an infected detainee on the range this time, you never do find out.";
					say "     But the important part is, after giving the soldiers a proper scare for breaking regs, you're taken aside and given a fresh review by a different team of clearly military scientists and psychologists. They are more extensive in their testing, focusing more on your physical and mental attributes as well as going over the material relating to Dr. Matt. It's clear the military consider the good doctor a very important asset and when you sit back down with the officer (of suspiciously unclear rank, you can't help but note), you're tapped to be part of a team to continue assisting him. And while part of you would like to just leave the events in the city behind, the lure of excitement, money and access to military-grade weapons ends up too tempting. You accept the offer.";
					say "     From that point, your processing is expedited and you join a few others, predominantly veteran soldiers unfortunate enough to become partially or fully infected, but were both disciplined and lucky enough to avoid succumbing before being retrieved. And while your rabbit-tinged infection isn't as overtly impressive as the big wolves, felines and bears some of them have become, you don't back down. It also helps that one of the group, a tiger-headed staff sergeant tells the others of a run-in he had with a bunny girl not unlike you. She was pink though, adding insult to injury, and the bouncy gunbunny took out half his squad before a lucky shot did her in. A consummate professional, he doesn't let that experience taint his opinion of you. If anything, he's you're first true friend in the group, accepting right away that you belong on the team. The others come along soon enough, once they get a chance to see your speed, mobility and shooting prowess in action when you start training as a unit.";
					say "     The training is difficult - you've missing a lot of the basic training the others have - but your tiger friend is always there to help you through it. And while he may have been one of the most senior ranking members, ranks don't matter among your group. Your special unit is outside the normal military chain of command, so many of the normal regs don't apply either. So a few months down the road, when the two of you start fucking, there's only the normal teasing that comes from comradery[if Player is impreg_ok]. And while having you pregnant does put you out of action periodically, your tiger-bunny offspring make good recruits for other military projects[end if].";
				else if hospquest < 14:
					say "     You feel a little on edge the whole time you're at the camp, not at all at ease with sitting around and waiting. Thankfully the disinterest of the scientists works in your favor and your particular infection provides no particular delay with you being cleared and released. You try a few jobs, but none of them seem to work for you. Finding you crave some excitement, you sign up with Zephyr, joining a [']task squad['] of theirs - basically corporate soldiers sent in to do stuff for the company.";
					say "     Your first few missions are easy enough, guarding equipment shipments and escorting personnel around semi-safe zones. You finally get some proper action about a month after joining up when some centaurs get the idea that feel you're passing through their territory and attack.";
					if level of Player >= 16:
						say "     While they're tough, you're able to keep ahead of them, holding the charge at bay for a while thanks to your fast movements and lots of well-aimed bullets. This buys time for an engineer you're escorting to open the security crate they brought, pulling a strange energy weapon from it. Seeing how you're by far the most effective at dealing with the centaur forces, she pushes it into your hands.";
						say "     A rush of excitement runs through you and you can't help but giggle a little. This gun just feels so right in your paw-hands that intuitively know how you power it up and charge back into the fray with renewed vigor. You end up leading a counterattack by your remaining squad-mates and send the centaurs scattering after a few volleys of searing energy take down the lead equines. You and your squad chase down a few stragglers to make sure they know not to mess with Zephyr again before returning to secure the transport. Once it's all said and done, you get a nice bonus out of it as well as the gratitude of the engineer.";
						say "     And while you have to reluctantly return to prototype energy rifle, the tech arranges to get you a new one of your very own a couple months later - the first of the production models. You thank her heartily for it with a big kiss that turns into a romp right there in her lab[if Player is male], leaving her with a bunny bun in the oven[end if]. Your squad ends up working with her regularly, always getting the newest tech from her division to play with. And your budding relationship with her continues as well, soon becoming a couple and moving in together.";
					else if level of Player >= 8:
						say "     While they're tough, you're able to slow their charge thanks to your fast movements and lots of bullets. In the end, your squad is forced to fall back, leaving the case you were escorting to get trampled, but at least managing to carry off the engineer while you provide cover fire for the remains of your team. And while the higher-ups are upset at the lost cargo, at least the tech who developed it was kept safe. You're even given a small bonus for guarding everyone's retreat. You use it to treat the others in the squad to a night out on the town, which ends in some hot and heavy fun with them back at your place[if Player is male or player is impreg_ok]. This romp results in quite a few bunny babies by the time it's all said and done[end if].";
					else:
						say "     They prove to be quite tough and you're only able to slow a few from the charge thanks to your fast movements and wild sprays of bullets. While it does little to stop them, you're able to keep yourself from being overrun. The rest of the squad, the engineer and the equipment you were escorting all end up being lost though, with you as the sole survivor able to get away. The higher-ups are none to pleased with the failed mission and you get chewed out about it repeatedly over the next several days. The execs, always money-focused, decide to only give you half-pay for the mission and reassign you to another squad. In the end, the fault is placed on your fallen squad-mates - something which rankles you badly, but you can't object too strongly about it or face punishment yourself.";
						say "     On your new team, you're seen as a bit of a bad luck charm, but thankfully things never go quite so bad as that one mission. You'd leave, but the excitement and the pay are enough to keep you there. It's a living.";
				else:
					say "     Thankfully, Dr. Mouse is able to see beyond your surface appearance and is well aware of your true capabilities. As arranged in advance, he gets in contact with you and gets you working for him once again. He pays you well for your services, both in money and in nanite improvements. You [if level of Player >= 16]are put in charge of his acquisition teams and often going into the field with these infected mercenary forces[else]are put in charge of one of his acquisition teams, leading his infected mercenary force[end if]. Their typical missions involve live sample acquisition of mutant creatures, though the good doctor's not above some industrial espionage or sabotage to ensure that his expertise always remains both extremely desirable and valuable. Working for him satisfies that deep-down craving you have for excitement and gunplay.";
			else:
				say "     You bounce around from job to job for a while, not really finding anything that quite works for you. Craving a bit of excitement, you answer a posting calling for citizens willing to perform guard duty around your town. While little more than a half-assed militia meant to help protect against attacks from roving mutants, your short training session convinces you right away that you made the right call joining up. There was just something particularly satisfying about being given a rifle and having your first live-fire target practice. You excel on the range and later while on duty.";
				say "     While this guard duty is only part-time and shifts are generally uneventful, it does provide enough excitement and opportunities to do some shooting to satisfy your cravings. Having an opportunity to scratch your itchy trigger finger also helps you better focus on doing your regular job, finally allowing you to keep one for more than a couple of months. While it's nothing special, just an office job, you are able to make a living at it until something better comes along. Having made friends with the others on the guard militia, you get to know the local gun dealer and eventually start working for him. In a world where sometimes [']might makes right['], being the one that sells the guns and ammo is a very lucrative business.";
