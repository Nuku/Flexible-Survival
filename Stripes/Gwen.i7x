She's got a cute face topped with equine ears poking from her curly hair, now dark red in colour.  She wears a [if hp of Gwen < 10]girls['] pink t-shirt with a smiling yellow sun[otherwise]a purple t-shirt with some colourful ponies[end if] on it that Vanessa found for her over her petite, brown-skinned body.  Her equine lower half has a russet red coat that shifts to chestnut brown at her ankles, just like her mother's.  But unlike her mother, she's still got her demonic red tail, a lingering remainder of her earlier infection.  She may still just be learning to cope with having four legs now, but it seems like she's inherited a bit of Meredith's clumsiness as well.  Still quite small, she clings happily to her mother's side, either snuggling up beside her or nursing for more milk to help her grow.";

She wears a [if hp of Gwen < 30]rock band t-shirt[otherwise]rock band t-shirt that's showing signs of trouble containing her prominent, pubescent breasts[end if] over her maturing figure.  With her dark skin and russet coat, red hair and increasingly feminine figure, you can tell she'll be quite the lovely mare soon.  While her equine lower body looks much like her mother's, [if hp of Gwen < 30]she's nearly as tall as her already[otherwise]she's a little taller than her already[end if].  Her demonic red tail still lingers as a remainder of her earlier infection and has started being more active as the growing foal's hormones kick in.";
	otherwise:
		say "     Gwen's matured into a beautiful and sexy centaur mare.  She's a blend of her old self and her mare mother, but more than a hand taller than her - nearly Vanessa's height even.  She's got a lovely face with an alluring smile and has grown out her curly red hair so it hangs to her shoulders.  Her upper body's matured back into the super-appealing succubus from when you first met her.  Her body has a perfect hourglass figure, plump breasts and flawless chocolate brown skin.  She wears a red bikini top that struggles to contain her bountiful melons.  Her equine lower body has the same russet-red coat with chestnut socks as her mother has.  Her demonic red tail flicks around as another reminder of her earlier self.  Her voice is smooth and sultry whenever she speaks.  Beautiful and knowing it, the sexy mare is eager to show off her sexy body and shares it often with [if coleen is bunkered and ( coleenslut > 0 or coleenalpha > 0 or coleencollared > 0 )]Vanessa and Coleen[otherwise]Vanessa[end if] when not helping her mother with her research.";

This isn't too out of the ordinary, but Gwen's laden down with a pack of gear and has pulled on the top half of her jumpsuit loosely over top of her bikini.  Heading over, you ask them what's up.";
			say "     'Oh, I was just about to come see you,' Gwen says with a sexy smile.  'Aunt Van- I mean the sarge has a mission for me.  So I'll be heading out.  There's some... scouting she needs me to take care of.  I probably won't be back here, but hopefully I'll still get to see you once this mess is all done,' she says, running her hands down your side before grabbing your ass.";
			say "     There's another long round of goodbyes and tears are shed, mostly by the [']mother['] and [']daughter['], though there's a promise by Meredith to see her as soon her work's done.  You try to get some more info out of Vanessa, but she says it's military secrets and winks coyly.  Still, it doesn't sound like it's anything too dangerous for the sexy centaur - well, at least no more dangerous than any trip out into the city can be.  You wish her the best of luck and hope to see her again, watching that sexy ass of hers as she leaves.";

after going to Bunker while hp of Gwen is 61:
	say "     It takes you a few moment to notice that Gwen's not in the bunker.  And more than not just being there, her stuff's gone as well.  Aside from some of her childhood crayon drawings left on her bunk, she's cleared out.  Asking Meredith about this, she's a little teary eyed, but says that Vanessa needed Gwen to go out on a very important mission.  From how thoroughly she's cleared out and her mother's sad face, you know she won't be back here again.  While neither of the centaurs will tell you what this mission is, it's clear they both feel it's important enough for her to go deal with it, but safe enough that she can handle it on her own.  Meredith does talk about how she'll be seeing her sweet Gwenny again as soon as her own research is done.";
