Her equine lower half has a russet red coat that shifts to chestnut brown at her ankles, just like her mother's. But unlike her mother, she's still got her demonic red tail, a lingering remainder of her earlier infection. She may still just be learning to cope with having four legs now, but it seems like she's inherited a bit of Meredith's clumsiness as well. Still quite small, she clings happily to her mother's side, either snuggling up beside her or nursing for more milk to help her grow.";

She's got a lovely face with an alluring smile and has grown out her curly red hair so it hangs to her shoulders. Her upper body's matured back into the super-appealing succubus from when you first met her. Her body has a perfect hourglass figure, plump breasts and flawless chocolate brown skin. She wears a red bikini top that struggles to contain her bountiful melons. Her equine lower body has the same russet-red coat with chestnut socks as her mother has. Her demonic red tail flicks around as another reminder of her earlier self. Her voice is smooth and sultry whenever she speaks. Beautiful and knowing it, the sexy mare is eager to show off her sexy body and shares it often with [if Colleen is bunkered and ( ColleenSlut > 0 or ColleenAlpha > 0 or ColleenCollared > 0 )]Vanessa and Colleen[else]Vanessa[end if] when not helping her mother with her research.";

You try to get some more info out of Vanessa, but she says it's military secrets and winks coyly. Still, it doesn't sound like it's anything too dangerous for the sexy centaur - well, at least no more dangerous than any trip out into the city can be. You wish her the best of luck and hope to see her again, watching that sexy ass of hers as she leaves.";

Aside from some of her childhood crayon drawings left on her bunk, she's cleared out. Asking Meredith about this, she's a little teary-eyed, but says that Vanessa needed Gwen to go out on a very important mission. From how thoroughly she's cleared out and her mother's sad face, you know she won't be back here again. While neither of the centaurs will tell you what this mission is, it's clear they both feel it's important enough for her to go deal with it, but safe enough that she can handle it on her own. Meredith does talk about how she'll be seeing her sweet Gwenny again as soon as her own research is done.";

Gwen ends here.
