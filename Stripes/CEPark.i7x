Section 1 - Strange Sight (by Kaleem)

to say cepark1:
	say "Walking through the forested area of the park you slowly get the creepy feeling that something is watching you. Mind instantly on edge you find your senses spreading out around you as you try and locate the unknown entity, and then whip your head over to a clump of bushes as you hear them rustle suddenly. Memories of the days before with seeing what happened with mutants taking the unwary and then fucking them in many different, not to mention unwanted ways makes you eager to turn tail and flee. You really don't want to be around here in case something comes out to try and bring bodily harm onto your vulnerable person, but on a deeper introspection you realize that the feeling you're getting right now isn't exactly foreboding, so much as it is just...uncomfortable.  Like someone is staring at you from across a room without saying anything, instead they're just studying you. Steeling your resolve you find your feet taking you over to the bushes before you can weigh the pros and cons of giving into your curiosity. Getting up-close to the foliage you take a few calming breaths before reaching out with a shaky hand to part the clump of leaves. Once you do though your mouth just drops to the ground at the sight before you. Standing regal on four legs with the face of a human but the body of a horse, but one with scales of multiple colors instead of fur is the most bizarre creature you have seen to date. Its entire body seems to almost shine as the other's armor-like hide covers the creature's neck on down to its chest catching the surrounding light in strange and yet mysterious ways. Up on top of the monster's, no, more like deity's head, stands an impressive white spiraling horn that has to be almost twelve inches long, if not longer. A shaggy mane of green hair spills out around the side of the beast's neck but can do nothing to hide the human face of the other staring back at you";
	say "Not knowing what to do or say as the lips of the stallion-like animal rise up to smile at you the only action you find your body taking is freezing on the stop as you blink rapidly fluttering eyelids at the creature. The strange amalgamation gives you a small nod, as though approving of you in some way, and then turns to scamper off somewhere through the park. A long and bushy tails whips behind its back just as it disappears out of sight.";

Section 2 - Anxiety (by Kaleem)

to say cepark2:
	say "Seeing a group of soldiers going about their way throughout the park, you find your spirits lifting some as you run over to them to ask for help. You find that this move has turned out to be a big mistake because soon the armed humans are pointing the barrels of guns at you while yelling at you to halt. Skidding to an immediate stop you find yourself somewhat confused as the uniformed men and women glare at you before turning their heads to talk to one another. The conversation that occurs in front of you has your stomach knotting with butterflies while at the same time your heart freezes inside of yourself chest as the words [italic type]contaminated[roman type] and [italic type]neutralize[roman type] keep coming up too many times between the assembled group of soldiers. Being that there are five people in total, and you are not sure that you've gained a [italic type]bullet proof[roman type] hidden ability you don't think that it would be wise to try and test your luck against them. Especially given the twitchy fingers quivering along the triggers of the assorted weaponry facing in your direction as the soldiers continue to look back and forth from you and then to each other. Deciding that maybe it's time to get lost you flip your head to the left and then gasp and wave one of your hands around frantically while shouting [italic type]monster[roman type]. Instantly the five soldiers are swinging their guns in the way you point and then start firing frantically. You're flying on fast feet before they can even realize that they've been tricked.";

Section 3 - Secrets (by Kaleem)

to say cepark3:
	say "While walking through the streets of the town you find yourself coming to an old public bathroom and decide to stop in to see if the water is working in here. You doubt it though, but then again you can't be sure without checking, right? Getting into the public facility, you step carefully to avoid the globs of cum, milk and urine littering the once white tiled floor and walls, you wave your hand in front of your face to dispel the smell punching you into the face as you make your way to the women's side of the restrooms since you already know the guys side is probably a biohazard zone by now. Right before you head to the sinks, which are amazingly free from any kind of stains, you freeze in place as an all too familiar noise reaches your ears. Hearing stretching out wide just to be sure that you are not hearing things you find that the sounds of moaning and thumping are resounding from off of the walls of the public washroom and instantly you want to get out of here before trouble finds you. However, before you can beat a retreat one of the bathroom stalls pops open, the banging you had heard was coming from the cheap tin frame and not the far wall, and quickly two half dressed soldiers pop out and onto the ground. Both are still united as the larger of the pair, both of whom are indeed female, slaps her hands onto the floor to keep her bigger bulk from crushing her fuck buddy. You find it odd that two women could be making so much noise in the small enclosed space, all things considered, but rapidly your confusion is lifted in face of understanding as you turn your head to the side to see a large feline shaft connecting the two women together. It would seem that the larger valkyrie has been tainted by this unclean world.";
	say "You don't say anything as the blonde haired tigress-in-the-making quietly whispers to her fallen company, her eyes hastily checking over the other to make sure that the smaller brunette is alright. The pig tailed and bespectacled amazon underneath her can only shyly smile and then nod before reaching up to wrap her delicate hands around her would-be mate's neck. While only the blonde seems to have had any changes done to get genital area you take note of the dark stripes slowly growing onto the brunette's face, especially when the bigger woman starts thrusting into the smaller female's slightly weeping puss. Muscles seem to be forming on the valkyrie's chest and torso though as you watch six heavy set breast rise much more fully onto the blonde's already tight chest. Below the smaller brunette is slimming down and becoming somewhat more demure than she already is compared to her bigger lover as the glass wearing female shivers and shudders while arching back in pure rapture. The sloppy squelches of the tiger cock between them hammering into the smaller woman has you biting at your lower lip while reaching down to rub at your aching groin. They pay no attention to you, despite being three feet way as the two moan and growl together, their infection probably spreading on a deeper level internally before going to attack the outside of their beings. You can't help but feel that you have little right to impart yourself on this shared moment between the two lovers once you see the lust and love they have for each other shimmering inside of their respective green and brown colored eyes. Deciding not to bother them you hastily back away from the pair and then turn to haul ass out of the public bathroom, but not without shutting the door to the ladies room closed first. Idly you wonder if maybe some actual good has come from this entire fiasco with the out of control nanomachines, just in time to as a thunderous feline roar shakes the very foundations of the building your standing in. Definitely, it's time to go now.";
	remove 3 from cepark1list;


Section 4 - Mysterious Girl (by Kaleem)

to say cepark4:
	say "While taking a quick break in the park you find yourself stumbling over a peculiar looking sight. Not exactly sure of what you're seeing, you find yourself gazing up the image of a young girl lying down in slumber beside a large pine tree. This in itself wouldn't have been so mysterious were it not in fact that the female in question was surrounded by several feral wolves, all of whom were now looking at you with evil intent in their darkened eyes. Not exactly sure of what's going on, you take several tentative steps back from the assembled pack of wolves just in time to hear the girl mewl and then sneeze somewhat softly in her sleep. Most of the wolves turn to ignore you at this as they flip their heads around to look at the, probably seventeen year old human female, though you do notice that many of their pointed ears are flipped around into your direction. The young woman, who you just now happen to really get a better look at as you lift confused eyes from the lupines onto her, seems to be almost completely human in form and shape save for a few key features. With a slightly pale complexion, thin limbs for arms and legs, a pair of furry wolf ears placed neatly up onto her head, and a gothic looking dress on you have to wonder just what's up with this bizarre girl that she's not being instantly violated by the feral creatures sitting around her.";
	say "Interestingly enough your answer comes when one of the wolves, a shaggy brown furred thing that looks as though it hadn't seen water in days, shuffles itself up and over so that it can dip its snout under one of the female's prone hands. Said hand slowly starts to pet the beast's snout and you feel as though there's something very [italic type]off[roman type] about this kid. When bleary eyes open with several sleepy blinks you feel your blood freeze as crimson eyes turn to regard you with a somewhat confused look. There's just too much age and wisdom in those orbs for the girl to be human and quickly you feel like you need to leave, and leave now! Swallowing thickly you nod to the teenager, who stares at you impassively, and then back yourself away so that you can turn and run. Moving on fast feet away from that area of the park all you can do is wonder who or what that young girl was, her red eyes haunting your mind for several hours afterwards.";
	remove 4 from cepark1list;


Section 5 - Fox hunt (by Kaleem)

to say cepark5:
	say "While leisurely walking through the park you happen to hear the sounds of baying hounds howling off in the distance. Not really understanding what's going on you have just enough time to blink in surprise when a large latex fox runs straight pass you as though running for its life. Cocking your head to the side in wonder you have just enough time to jump out of the ways as several hound-like mutants dart pass you on the trail of the rubbery vulpine. When a powerful anthro mustang clomps his way after the hounds you can only gape like a fish at the incredulity of what you had just seen.";

Section 10 - Groundskeepers cabin (by Sarokcat)

to say cepark10:
	say "While traveling through the park, you come across a small locked building set back in the vegetation, closer investigation allows you to find a small sign that someone knocked over, declaring it to be one of the park buildings and employees only.  Deciding that under the circumstances you really don[']t care about the employees only rule, you search around the small building to try to find a way in, only to be frustrated at the way the building is locked up tight. Sighing you are eventually forced to go on your way, but maybe you will be back to try again later.";
	remove 10 from cepark2list;


Section 11 - Badger sighting (by Sarokcat)

to say cepark11:
	say "While traveling happily through the park, you hear a growling and snarling noise from on the other side of one of the nearby bushes.  Taking a careful look over the bushes, you note that one of those striped skunkbeasts seems to be threatening one of the bears wandering the park. The bear seems intimidated for some reason and is backing off slowly, which is confusing since the beast doesn[']t have its tail raised.  In fact, on closer inspection, the beast doesn[']t seem to have a skunk tail to raise, while it is striped its coloration is slightly different, and its build is considerably stockier.  It isn[']t until it scrapes its long claws along the ground and growls at the bear, sending it running, that you realize this is actually some kind of badger creature, and not a skunk after all!  After scaring the bear off the creature begins to scent the air and look around, he must be looking for you! You recall that badgers are one of the most dangerous and possessive burrowing creatures around, and realize that if he gets his hands on you he likely won[']t let you go, you turn and flee into the park before he can track you down.";
	remove 11 from cepark2list;


Section 12 - Empty jeep (by Sarokcat)

to say cepark12:
	say "While traveling through the park, you come across what is obviously a caretakers jeep.  The off-road vehicle is just sitting in the middle of a grassy area with its drivers side door wide open.  Moving closer to investigate, you notice that there is a strange and powerful smell is coming from within the jeep and realize that it seems like whoever was in the vehicle got sprayed by one of those wandering skunks and has probably been transformed into another of the beasts.  Sadly, you realize that whether the jeep works or not is irrelevant as the powerful and lingering musk would probably also change you into a skunk beast before you got very far.  Sighing, you continue on your way.";

Section 13 - small fire (by Sarokcat)

to say cepark13:
	say "While traveling through the park, you come across an area where someone seems to have recently set a small fire, the fire is slowly burning in a pit of stones in what looks to be the start of a small campsite. Sadly it seems like the fire has almost burned itself out, but you see no signs of whoever or whatever started the fire in the first place.  Figuring it would probably be best to keep moving, just in case the fire attracts something dangerous, you continue along your way.";

Section 14 - Torn vegetation (by Sarokcat)

to say cepark14:
	say "While traveling through the park, you come across an area where the vegetation is ripped and torn, and the ground is churned up and tossed around. You look around cautiously, but can[']t see anything that could cause this level of devastation, nearby at least. Determining it seems safe for the minute at least, you move closer to the damaged area, and try to figure out what might have happened. From what little you can tell as an inexperienced observer, there seem to be two different types of rather large claw marks, and it seems likely that two of the infected beasts ended up fighting each other here.  Observing the amount of damage they day, you shudder for a minute and hurry on your way, surviving until the rescue seems harder every day...";

Section 15 - Abandoned picnic (by Sarokcat)

to say cepark15:
	say "While traveling through the park, you come across a series of picnic tables set up for the casual parkgoer, normally this wouldn[']t be worthy of note, except that it seems someone tried to set up a large picnic here on one of the tables fairly recently.  You look around and try calling out to whoever the other person might be, but all you find are some small signs of a scuffle not far away.  Sighing you look through the remains of the picnic, and while bugs and the outdoors have gotten to much of it, you manage to find some still sealed chips that you take with you.";
