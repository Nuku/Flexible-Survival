	say "     Build onto a shelf of rock on the cliffside, this small building is located partway between the sandy beach below and the plaza above. Aside from likely providing some protection from the tides and storms, it also provides an excellent view of the beachgoers. The shop itself is a mix between a restaurant and a concession stand, having a wide window and counter with a few stools in front and the shopkeeper behind. There's also a couple of patio tables with parasols set out on the small plateau in front of it. The building is white with sky-blue trim while the sign above the window declares the place to be 'Sunny Snacks' and has a bright sun rising above the words. To either side of the service counter are the [link]menu[as]look menu[end link]. The person inside running the place is a surprisingly human woman, a definite oddity these days, especially for one so out in the open.";

This noise seems to light a fearful fire in the man's eyes and he wrestles himself on top. But rather than press his advantage over you, he jumps to his feet and runs for the stairs - only to be blasted in the back with a green beam of light. He stumbles as his feet turn to hooves. He fumbles his changing hands over his face as a piggy snout forms. His once-proud manhood shrinks away, leaving him, like the others, as filthy sows that squeal noisily as they flee from the wild-eyed Cindy.";

In some ways, it's as you'd expect such a vending shack to look. There's various boxes of snacks and coolers stocked with drinks as well as the fryers and fridges for the hot and cold foods. But it all looks off as well. The chips, for example, are an eclectic mix of bags - various flavors, brands and sizes, some you thought long discontinued. The same goes for the sodas, loosely assorted by type, but coming in a variety of brands. Among them, just as one example, is what appears to be a Japanese or possibly Korean can of Coke. There are odd flavors as well, including one that purports to be a [']Salmon Soda['] with a leaping fish on the can and everything. And while the place sells hot foods as well, the fryers are cleaned, empty and don't appear to have been used recently.

And given what you've seen her do, you're inclined to at least consider it a possibility. Despite all the infected creatures out on the beach and coming up to her little restaurant, she does seem completely uninfected and is unaffected by her many romps with them. She also takes a decidedly perverse enjoyment in the varied bestial forms her patrons have and always watches with keen interest should anyone on the beach be getting transformed.";

She's wearing what you can tell is a rather skimpy two-piece bikini under a white t-shirt emblazoned with the 'Sunny Snacks' name and sun-logo. By no means fat, she does look like she's put on a few pounds, though she carries it well.";
