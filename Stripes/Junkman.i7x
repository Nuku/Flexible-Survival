	say "     Thinking of his seed makes you notice that his balls feel strange against [if Player is male]yours[else]you[end if] as they bump into you with each thrust. Reaching back, you grab his sac to fondle him and find [one of]his balls have a plastic cover[or]it protected by what feels like a brass shell[or]it reinforced by several metal plates[or]some hard, rubber tubes leading into it[at random]. The creature atop you releases a grinding moan as you rub over his ballsack, clearly enjoying your touch despite their strange form. You can feel his balls start to throb warmly inside his odd scrotum and you are rewarded moments later by a steady stream of thick, oily cum. His slick seed pumps into you as some internal pump chugs away inside him, sending large amounts of his semen into you. Much of it flows up into your [if Player is female]waiting womb[else]sexy ass[end if] while the rest overflows around his cock to run down your thighs, with more gushing out as he withdraws and paints your ass with his last few spurts. Finished, he gives your sticky rear end a pat and wanders off.[impregchance]";

This is the Junkman Infection rule:

		trigger ending "Junkman Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			say "     Drawn back to the scrapyard by your corrupted instincts, you join the other junkmen in wandering around the piles of junk, satisfying your lusts on each other and others you find. Your people have little ambition or organization, only existing in the moment, enjoying short lives corrupting a handful of creatures and siring a few offspring before eventually breaking down and rejoining their scrapyard home.";
		else:
			say "     Your body is upsetting to several of the soldiers who find you during the rescue operation, but you are able to convince them that you are still sane. Taken from the outbreak city, you are scrutinized by several of the military scientists, intrigued by your haphazard cybernetics. They are unfortunately able to learn little from you, as what they discover about your anatomy makes no sense and they conclude that it is purely cosmetic.";
			say "     But you can sense that there is more to it and that somehow the junk is a part of you. You obtain old books on appliance repair and electronics from garage sales and study your odd body, spending several hours a week tinkering with yourself";
			if TailName of Player is "Junkman":
				say ". You discover early on that plugging yourself in feels very good and provides you with more energy. While you seem able to survive on just food or power, you operate at your best running on some of both.
