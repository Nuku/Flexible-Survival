Section 1 - Creature Responses

to say rhinodesc:
	setmongender 3; [creature is male]
	say "     The large, gray rhinoman spots you and charges. You only have a moment to take stock of him before he's upon you to fight. He's seems rather strongly built, a very tough hide of gray skin and a large horn rising from his pointed face. A second, even larger horn is equally hard between his legs.";

to say losetorhino:
	say "     The rhino man bowls you over and snorts angrily at you. Pinning you down, he tears at your clothes and pack, tossing them aside. His strong arms pin you down and he climbs atop you without any foreplay and grinds his throbbing horn against your ass. Precum flows down from his cock and gets smeared between your cheeks.";
	if Player is female:
		say "     After a few strokes while he forces you into the right position, he pulls back and lines his cock with your dripping pussy and drives it hard into you. You moan and gasp as the big rod pushes its way into you. Keeping you pinned down, he pumps and thrusts his pulsing cock into you repeatedly as he grunts and snorts until he finally cums hard, blasting his thick semen into you. His prodigious output fills your womb and swells your tummy before he's finally done. Sated for now, he gets up and pushes you over, then walks off with a final grunt.[impregchance]";
	else:
		say "     After a few strokes while he forces you into the right position, he pulls back and lines his cock with your tight pucker and drives hard into you. You release a muffled scream at the sudden intrusion as the big rod pushes its way into you. Keeping you pinned down, he pumps and thrusts into you repeatedly as he grunts and snorts until he finally cums hard, blasting his thick semen into you. His prodigious output fills your bowels and swells your tummy before he's finally done. Sated for now, he gets up and pushes you over, then walks off with a final grunt.[impregchance]";

to say beattherhino:
	say "     Managing to finally wear down the powerful creature, you [one of]get him to charge blindly past you and tumble into a nearby enclosure. Glancing down, you see him laying there, exhausted[or]dodge his final, blind charge and get him to bash right into a wall and pass out[or]breathe a sigh of relief as he finally passes out, completely exhausted[or]avoid his last charge and he plows off into the bushes. When he doesn't come back out, you conclude he's passed out, exhausted[at random]. You pant for breath and wipe the sweat from your brow before heading off to continue your searching.";

This is the Rhino Infection rule:

		trigger ending "Rhino Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			say "     As your mind gives in to your infection, you wander aimlessly and end up at the city zoo. There you come across a large rhino vehemently ramming his horn against the wall again and again, trying to break through. After a short conversation with him punctuated by hard cracks of him hitting the concrete barrier, you cannot find fault with his logic and soon join him in his efforts to crack through the wall.";
			say "     When you eventually manage to break through it together, it is as if all the zoo was waiting for that moment. There air is filled with successful shouting and cheering from creatures who had gathered to watch you both at work, many of whom run off to inform the rest of their pack or herd. The cries spread out across the zoo, getting louder and louder. As you and Brian struggle to your feet with pounding headaches, you can hear the sounds of the infected hordes of the zoo coming. You and Brian hurry through the gap, leading the charge against the few soldiers posted around what seemed until moments ago a closed section of military cordon. As you both are finally unleashing your pent up lust on some soldiers, hordes of felines, wolves and other creatures come spilling out, spreading out unchecked past the military's lines to spread before they can be contained. Mixed in with them are many smaller, weaker creatures who spent their time in hiding from the zoo's top predators, but are now free to roam and find places to spread their infection safely. You bellow out in climax as you watch this surge of lustful freedom and smile, knowing all your hard work and pain has paid off.";
		else:
			say "     Rescued from the city gone wild with infection, you are brought to the military's processing center while they try to sort out the many people they've rescued. Being of an obviously strong strain, the military tries to recruit you for their needs, but you decide against it in the end. You tell them that you've had enough of fighting and simply want a quiet, peaceful life. You get a country home and start working for construction firms. It is a lot of heavy lifting and manual labor, which comes easily to you strong body.";

Rhino ends here.
