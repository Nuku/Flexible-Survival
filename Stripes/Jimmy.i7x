The little guy struggles against them, swearing and snapping at them as he cries for help, but is no match for their robotic strength. A female automaton starts groping him with obvious intent.

You smile and tell him you're here to help before shoving back another of the automatons. He nods and gets onto all fours, running as quickly as he can on his short, stumpy limbs.

There was some food for a while, but eventually that ran out and I had to start eating from a bag of dog food. Tasty stuff, let me tell you,' he adds cheerfully.

Though he had meant it humorously, he looks adorably determined, his stubby arms folded in front of him, though his manically wagging tail rather ruins any chances of looking tough. 'As far as I can remember, I've always been a cheerful sort of person and if my apartment had survived I could have shown you all my school pictures with me genuinely smiling while so many of the others had to force theirs. Despite my cheerfulness, I didn't have many friends at school. I wasn't smart enough for the nerds nor athletic enough for the jocks.

A few people would take pity on me and let me sit with them from time to time at lunch, but I didn't fit in so I was usually left to be taken in by another group every few weeks. I'm making it sound much worse than it was and you don't need to feel sorry for me. That was then, and now I have you[if hunger of Paula > 0], Paula,[end if] and Alexandra. I was good at English classes, especially the oratory presentations, so when I had graduated high school, I did a dual degree in English and Political Science. It was only when I had received the bit of paper at the end that I realized that I didn't know what I wanted to do next. My parents had moved house to the other side of the country, meaning I couldn't live at home while I decided, so I asked my sister for a loan and bought an apartment. I do hope she's alright. She was meant to be leaving for a business trip just after people started changing, so I don't even know whether she is in the city or not.'

We can talk again later if that's alright.'";
