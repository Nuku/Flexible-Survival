As he lines it up with your wet [if cunts of player > 0]pussy[otherwise]tight pucker[end if][if hp of player > 0], you moan softly in anticipation[otherwise], you struggle a little in vain[end if] before he sinks it into you.  You grip your improvised seat as he starts thrusting into you repeatedly, quickly making you grow excited and lustful.

The creature atop you releases a grinding moan as you rub over his ballsac, clearly enjoying your touch despite their strange form.  You can feel his balls start to throb warmly inside his odd scrotum and you are rewarded moments later by a steady stream of thick, oily cum.  His slick seed pumps into you as some internal pump chugs away inside him, sending large amounts of his semen into you.  Much of it flows up into your [if cunts of player > 0]waiting womb[otherwise]sexy ass[end if] while the rest overflows around his cock to run down your thighs, with more gushing out as he withdraws and paints your ass with his last few spurts.  Finished, he gives your sticky rear end a pat and wanders off.";

	now desc entry is "[junkmandesc]";						[ Description of the creature when you encounter it. ]
	now face entry is "mostly human, but with a stainless steel panel across one side and under your chin.  From the shape of it, you'd guess it belongs on some kind of kitchen appliance.  You have three rows of mismatched bolts running over it, almost like a strange mohawk of metal";
	now body entry is "human, but with numerous pieces of scrap protruding from or replacing body parts.  There are some metal and plastic vanes attached to your shoulders, various external wires and cords, the handle to an old iron at your hip and metal pipes which sounds hollow replacing your left forearm, to name just a few.  Your hands are thankfully normal save for a few wires embedded in the skin, allowing you full use of them.  One foot has been replaced with the lower half of an iron and seems to match the handle at your hip[if cocks of player > 0].  A quartet of brass tubes run across the surface of your skin and flex with it.  These lead from a valve which has replaced your navel to your balls[end if][if cunts of player > 0].  A trio of pink, plastic tubes run from your sides, starting just above the hip and across the surface of your skin.  These lead down to your groin and link into your cunt, which is wet and slick with the oily lubricant flowing into it constantly[end if]";
	now skin entry is "human skin covered in a mish-mash of metal and plastic plates, many of them old and dented.  Random bits of junk protrude from your skin at odd places as well";

The whirring only gets worse as you can feel several hard protuberances growing out from the top of your head";
	now body change entry is "the sounds of banging on metal and plastic comes from it.  These even feel like dull thumps across your body as your changes come sporadically.  Your body becomes human in form, at its basic level, but several parts are replaced with assorted junk.  Stray wires grow out from your skin, only to curl around and sink back in elsewhere.  One of your feet grow hard and heavy, reforming into the lower half of an iron.  It is difficult to focus on all the changes happening to you as your body becomes a strange cyborg made of junk[if cocks of player > 0].  Brass tubes form against your skin near your groin, attached at one end to your balls[end if][if cunts of player > 0].  Pink plastic tubes form against your skin near your groin, running to your cunt.  You can feel your pussy grow wet as the clear, oily lubricant keeps you slick and ready for mating[end if]";
	now skin change entry is "your skin becomes smooth and human, lightly tanned.  But before you can appreciate this change towards normalcy, the sensation of change intensifies in random locations as a mish-mash of metal and plastic plates start to appear.  Many of these are old and dented and don't quite fit the spots they're replacing.  Some protrude out too far while others flex and shift as you bend.  Other small chunks of junk and scrap protrude almost at random from your";

		otherwise:
			say "     Your body is upsetting to several of the soldiers who find you during the rescue operation, but you are able to convince them that you are still sane.  Taken from the outbreak city, you are scrutinized by several of the military scientists, intrigued by your haphazard cybernetics.  They are unfortunately able to learn little from you, as what they discover about your anatomy makes no sense and they conclude that it is purely cosmetic.";

While you seem able to survive on just food or power, you operate at your best running on some of both.  As an extra bonus, after a good, long charge, you are a randy lover with very long endurance, pleasing your partners greatly";
			say ".  You open what panels you can and replace any frayed wires or corroded tubes you can find with replacements you scavenge from old appliances you collected during your yard sale hunting.  While you can't really tell what most of these do, you do start to feel better over time as you make these repairs.  While your new form is rather offputting, you do manage to make some new friends and meet new lovers, who also seem pleased with your body's improved function.  By keeping proper maintenance on yourself, you manage to live a long and pleasurable life, surviving several generations of other species";
