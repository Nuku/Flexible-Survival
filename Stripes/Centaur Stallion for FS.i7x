He thrusts in and out of you, grunting in a near beastial manner as that gigantic rod pounds into you over and over.  With a sound almost like a neigh, he drives deep inside you and cums powerfully, filling you with copious amounts of centaur spunk.

As his cock starts to emerge, you eye that thick, black meat hungrily, licking your lips.  Leaning further under him, you bring that large cock to your mouth and start licking and kissing at its flared glans, making it swell faster.  Soon, centaur pre is leaking onto your tongue.  You lick and suck at it until it grows too large and full to fit in your mouth before pulling it you.  You run your hands along the equine member and fondle those huge balls while tending to the giant horse cock before you.  As his glans flares and he starts to whinny excitedly, you hold the end with one hand while rubbing his balls with the other.  Holding it in place, you get him to blast shot after shot of hot, equine cum into your mouth and down your throat.  You swallow as much of it as you can, though much of his copious flow ends up running down your chest.  Satisfied, you give his equine ass a swat, sending him galloping off.  As you watch him go and rub your full, bloated tummy, you can feel the warmth of his seed inside you, spreading into tingles of his spreading infection.";

His upper body is human and strongly built, with hard muscles and broad shoulders on that tanned, male body.  His arms are human in appearance and quite muscular.  Being a centaur, his legs are replaced in her entirety from the waist down by the body of a horse.  His muscled, equine body has slender legs leading to a set of four shiny black hooves.  A long flowing tail trails behind.  Below that equine body is a massive sheath, bloated and full, as are the watermelon-sized balls behind it.";
