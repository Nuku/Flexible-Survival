The raccoon has a slender, feminine build. The fur that should normally be the dark mask around its eyes is a cotton-candy pink, as are the stripes to ring its tail, matching the striped top it wears. The pink raccoon looks you over, licking its lips and smiling at you with a girlish grin, running its paws down its body. That's when you notice that this rather flat-chested girl has a bulge in 'her' skirt. The gay boytoy grins playfully as you notice the growing bump in his mini skirt and moves in to play with you.";
