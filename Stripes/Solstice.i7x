Before you is a female silver fox with several fluffy tails.  She's dressed rather more unusually than most others you've met.  Her red, sleeveless top is tight over her breasts and she has a pair of khaki shorts with some pouches belted to it.  She has a pair of goggles on her head, work resting above her brow.  Slung over her back is a backpack.  Her appearance, save for her sexy, vulpine nature would lead you to imagine her as a character in an adventure movie or video game, perhaps raiding tombs or hunting relics.  Aside from her paw resting on the machete strapped to her hip, she doesn't seem aggressive.";

You might be able to help me with a little something.'  You try to think back on recent events, wondering what this vixen may have caught you doing.  Warily, you ask her just what she had in mind.  'Oh, nothing like that, sweety.  Well, not yet anyhow.  If you're good, maybe,' she adds with a tilt of her hip and another sly grin, but you catch her paw back on the machete.";
		say "     'I had a little... misunderstanding with that sphinx woman in the museum.  I was taking... an interest in one of the artifacts on display and she didn't take too kindly to that.  I'm a treasure hunter by trade and my most recent discovery led me to a piece held in the museum.  It's not like it's doing anyone any good in there with the city like this, so what's the harm, I say?'  Her numerous, fluffy tails swish behind her.  'I mean, I've already been turned into a fox by this crazy venture and now I've got to deal with a mad sphinx who thinks her museum will somehow remain open.";

You seem chummy enough with her that she'll let you roam around the museum.  I want you to go in and get the Onyx Crow's head for me.  It's incorrectly housed in the Greek Artifacts wing, though it's actually of Scythian origin.'  Seeing your lack of recognition in your eyes, she just rolls hers.  'Look, it's a carved crow's head made of black stone with some gold on it.  It's about the size of baseball.  Simple enough?";
		say "     Once you've got it, just find your way back here and I'll trade you some supplies for it.'  With a swish of her hips and numerous tails, she grins.  'And maybe throw in a special reward, too.'  With that, she runs off into an alley, disappearing and quickly as she came.

I've finally struck it big this time!' she says with elation in her voice.  She puts a paw over her mouth, suddenly wary that her raised voice will call undo attention.  Grabbing your wrist, she leads you between a few buildings.  'You can call me Solstice by the way.  I've been in the treasure hunting biz for a while, but this'll be my best find yet, thanks to you.'  She slips into a small, vacant shop and shuts the boarded up door behind you.  It looks like it was closed down long before the outbreak, making it a fairly safe place to hide out.";

Unwrapping them reveals two more onyx carvings, much like the head, but representing the upper and lower body of a crow.  'Those archeologists who found this didn't know the first thing about what they were talking about.  The head's not part of a staff, it's part of a statuary.  I traced some clues and found the Scythian tombs where the other two were held.  The last had been raided by the ancient Greeks, which is how it ended up in Minos's treasure room.  And now, if I... can... just...' she says, focusing on the middle piece, turning some subtle mechanism hidden in the stone.  'There!' she says as short pegs pop from the top and bottom of it so it can be fitted to the others.  'The head alone might be a curiosity, but the whole statue will be worth a whole lot mo-wwwahhhhh!'";

The golden eyes shine brightly as well, pouring a focused beam of golden light into the adventurer's eyes, transfixing her in its gaze.  The black energy curls in the air, coiling around Solstice's arms and sinking into her.  She groans as the dark glow expands, the darkness seems to seep into her paws, turning them black.  This blackness spreads up her arms and into her body, which creaks and pops as the cursed aura changes her.  As the blackened fur starts to turn into feathers, the ebon light climbs over her head, changing it as well.  Her muzzle hardens and reshapes itself into a pointed beak.";
			say "     When large wings emerge from her back, you manage to overcome your shock at the rapid transformation.  Grabbing a nearby length of pipe, you swing it at the cursed artifact.  There is a high-pitched shriek as the blow connects, knocking the Onyx Crow from Solstice's taloned paws.  The partially-transformed vixen collapses to the floor, scrambling away from the artifact.  It shrieks and caws angrily for a few minutes, black talons of dark light clawing around it, seeking its victim? prey? host? before its power seems to fade with a long caw of 'Nooooo!'";

There are a few clicks and the three parts unlock and fall apart, once again trapping whatever that was.  With the pipe still falling apart, you bump the three sections to opposite ends of the room and turn your attention to Solstice.";
			say "     Whatever just happened, whether some bizarre effect of the infection or some strange, magical power, it has left a profound impact on the vixen.  Her upper body has been turned into that of a crow, with a largely corvid head, taloned hands like a bird's foot and black feathers across her upper half.  There are still some subtle signs of her previous vulpine nature as well, with foxish ears on her head and mammalian breasts filling her red shirt.  Her lower body is largely unchanged, though the tips of her tails now end in black plumage.";

Her talons run through her feathers and she moans softly, clearly finding sensual pleasure in her new form.  Stretching her wings and stroking her breasts, she turns back to you.  'Now, I do believe I promised you a reward, sweety,' she purrs sensually, a lustful glint in her eyes that wasn't there before.  Do you want to take her up on her offer?";

Her lovely breasts are covered in soft, black feathers and her nipples are silvery spots half-hidden beneath that soft down.  Looking lower, the feathers transition back to fur at her slender waist.  As your eyes travel further, she spreads her legs and teases her wet pussy with a moan.  The soft, gray fur of her muff parts to show the dark lips of her waiting sex.  She grins at the corners of her beak, crooking a finger for you to approach and get your [']reward['].";

Her feathered body rubs against you as your cock brushes across her furry, vixen pussy before sinking into her, making her moan lustfully.  You run your hands over her, enjoying the sensual way her body moves against your as you thrust into her.

You dive your tongue in deeper while she fingers you, licking up what flowing juices she can get.  You both continue like this until you both cry out in orgasmic pleasure, Solstice cawing loudly in release.

You feel a warm, pleasant tingle  every time she does this as if part of her is flowing into you.  She pays particular attention to your clit, perhaps rubbing it in the hopes it will grow into a lovely cock for her.";
			say "     Eventually, the vulpogryph's playful fingers eventually send you over the edge as she switches again.  You cum hard, soaking her hand in your juices as you climax.  You moan and kiss her passionately over and over again as your cunt quivers in delight.  As your climax wanes, she moves the soaked paw to her pussy and fingers herself hard and fast, soon peeking as your juices are rubbed into her vaginal walls.  She caws loudly in pleasure and her sweet waters drip down onto your already sticky crotch.  She gives you a few last playful nips and rolls over onto her back beside you, moaning softly after her powerful release.";
			say "     'Mmmm... that was very nice, my dear.  It felt so good to share myself with you like that.  Though think how much better it would be if you had a nice, hard cock to fill me.  You should get on that, sweety,' she purrrs, running a feather across your sensitive pussy and flicking it across your clit.  She rests her head on your chest and you put your arms around her, holding the lovely vulpogryph while feeling much closer to her after your time together.";

'I found it while investigating an medieval nunnery.  It seems one of the sisters was not as chaste as she should have been.'  Pulling it out, she reveals a phallis made of hard, polished wood.  'It's very smooth and was such a nice fit that I decided just to keep it for myself.  Though I wouldn't mind sharing it with my special sweety,' she adds, nipping at your neck as she brushes the dildo's glans across your pussy.";

But when she slides it into you, it feels very pleasant and is indeed quite smooth and polished, sliding with ease into your wanton folds.  The toy is quite arousing, shaped perfectly to please a woman and the thoughts of chaste, virginal sisters of the cloth using this sends lustful shivers along your spine.  You bury your face in Solstice's downy bosom, nuzzling her breasts before moving your lips to her silvery nipple.  You lick, kiss and suckle at it and are surprised when it starts to give a little milk.  Her taste is exciting, but very hard to describe.  You can find no comparison for it, but find it wonderfully unique and made just for you.";

She moans lustfully as she presses it between her wet folds with a mini-orgasm of her own.  You stroke your wet folds and finger yourself as you await your turn again, keeping yourself excited, but saving your climax for the wonderful toy.  When she returns it to your cunt, you get her to fuck you thoroughly with it, bucking and moaning loudly until finally you have a crashing climax that leaves you panting on your back.  Moments later, the toy stuffed back into her, Solstice orgasms as well.  You cuddle in each other's arms, panting and soaked in musky, female cum.";
		otherwise if solsticefsex is odd:
			say ".  After lowering you to the ground and snuggling to to you, she rummages through her bag once again.  Pulling out the shapely toy, she grins at you and you nod happily and spread your legs.  You nuzzle and kiss one another while taking turns with the smooth dildo inside your gripping cunts.  You alternate several times, spreading your pussy juices across it and with each other as you fuck yourselves and each other with it.  Nuzzling at her bosom, you nurse for her milk, getting her to moan as you enjoy her unique taste flowing across your tongue.  You share the toy back and forth until you both come to a wild, crashing orgasm.  Panting after your lovemaking, you cuddle together and she nuzzles you, musing about how much nice it'd be with the real thing.";

Plucking a feather from her plumage, she grins and slides it teasingly across your inner thigh, then across your balls and over your cock.  You groan softly and your cock twitches at the delicate touch of the soft feather teasing you.  Solstice nuzzles at your chest while continuing to tickle your thigh and caress your throbbing erection with it.";

Her slender, vulpine tummy bloats up considerably as your excessively large balls drain into her.  She moans happily at the sight of this and rubs her taloned paws over she overstuffed womb[otherwise if cock width of player >= 12].  Her slender, vulpine tummy gains a plump bulge from the considerable output of your large balls.  She smiles at the sight of this and rubs her taloned paws over the bulge of her filled womb[otherwise].  She smiles in pleasure as she feels you drain your balls into her womb[end if].
