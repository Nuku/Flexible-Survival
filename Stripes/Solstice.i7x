		say "     Traveling the city streets, you take a moment to glance behind you and, as you return your eyes to your path, you find it blocked by another figure. Before you is a female silver fox with several fluffy tails. She's dressed rather more unusually than most others you've met. Her red, sleeveless top is tight over her breasts and she has a pair of khaki shorts with some pouches belted to it. She has a pair of goggles on her head, worn resting above her brow. Slung over her back is a backpack. Her appearance, save for her sexy, vulpine nature would lead you to imagine her as a character in an adventure movie or video game, perhaps raiding tombs or hunting relics. Aside from her paw resting on the machete strapped to her hip, she doesn't seem aggressive.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Well, hello there,' she says with a touch of a grin at the edge of her muzzle. 'I spotted you a while ago and have been keeping my eye on you. You might be able to help me with a little something.' You try to think back on recent events, wondering what this vixen may have caught you doing. Warily, you ask her just what she had in mind. 'Oh, nothing like that, sweetie. Well, not yet anyhow. If you're good, maybe,' she adds with a tilt of her hip and another sly grin, but you catch her paw back on the machete.";
		say "     'I had a little... misunderstanding with that sphinx woman in the museum. I was taking... an interest in one of the artifacts on display and she didn't take too kindly to that. I'm a treasure hunter by trade and my most recent discovery led me to a piece held in the museum. It's not like it's doing anyone any good in there with the city like this, so what's the harm, I say?' Her numerous, fluffy tails swish behind her. 'I mean, I've already been turned into a fox by this crazy venture and now I've got to deal with a mad sphinx who thinks her museum will somehow remain open.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You find yourself wondering what she would have done had the outbreak not occurred, but have no time to ask as she presses onwards. 'And that's where you come in. You seem chummy enough with her that she'll let you roam around the museum. I want you to go in and get the Onyx Crow's head for me. It's incorrectly housed in the Greek Artifacts wing, though it's actually of Scythian origin.' Seeing your lack of recognition in your eyes, she just rolls hers. 'Look, it's a carved crow's head made of black stone with some gold on it. It's about the size of baseball. Simple enough?";
		say "     'Once you've got it, just find your way back here and I'll trade you some supplies for it.' With a swish of her hips and numerous tails, she grins. 'And maybe throw in a special reward, too.' With that, she runs off into an alley, disappearing and quickly as she came. You find yourself thinking about her offer, wondering if it's time to make a trip back to the museum.";

	else:
		say "     Managing to find your way through the chaos of the city, you make your way back to the intersection where you first met the vulpine adventurer. True to her word, she steps out from one of the alleyways as you arrive. 'Did you get it?' she asks quickly";
		if Crow Artifact is owned:
			say ". Nodding, you slip off your pack and remove the carving. She smiles happily and snatches it out of your hand, looking it over with a critical eye. 'Yes! I've got it all. I've finally struck it big this time!' she says with elation in her voice. She puts a paw over her mouth, suddenly wary that her raised voice will call undo attention. Grabbing your wrist, she leads you between a few buildings. 'You can call me Solstice by the way. I've been in the treasure hunting biz for a while, but this'll be my best find yet, thanks to you.' She slips into a small, vacant shop and shuts the boarded up door behind you. It looks like it was closed down long before the outbreak, making it a fairly safe place to hide out.";
			ItemLoss Crow Artifact by 1;
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Setting the onyx carving onto a table, she slips off her own pack and pulls out two cloth-wrapped bundles. Unwrapping them reveals two more onyx carvings, much like the head, but representing the upper and lower body of a crow. 'Those archaeologists who found this didn't know the first thing about what they were talking about. The head's not part of a staff, it's part of a statuary. I traced some clues and found the Scythian tombs where the other two sections were held. The last had been raided by the ancient Greeks, which is how it ended up in Minos's treasure room. And now, if I... can... just...' she says, focusing on the middle piece, turning some subtle mechanism hidden in the stone. 'There!' she says as short pegs pop from the top and bottom of it so it can be fitted to the others. 'The head alone might be a curiosity, but the whole statue will be worth a whole lot mo-wwwahhhhh!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     As she clicks the final piece into place and turns the golden collar to lock the head on, her elation turns to startled fear as a black energy flows from the statuary. The golden eyes shine brightly as well, pouring a focused beam of golden light into the adventurer's eyes, transfixing her in its gaze. The black energy curls in the air, coiling around Solstice's arms and sinking into her. She groans as the dark glow expands, the darkness seems to seep into her paws, turning them black. This blackness spreads up her arms and into her body, which creaks and pops as the cursed aura changes her. As the blackened fur starts to turn into feathers, the ebon light climbs over her head, changing it as well. Her muzzle hardens and reshapes itself into a pointed beak.";
			say "     When large wings emerge from her back, you manage to overcome your shock at the rapid transformation. Grabbing a nearby length of pipe, you swing it at the cursed artifact. There is a high-pitched shriek as the blow connects, knocking the Onyx Crow from Solstice's taloned paws. The partially-transformed vixen collapses to the floor, scrambling away from the artifact. It shrieks and caws angrily for a few minutes, black talons of dark light clawing around it, seeking its victim? prey? host? before its power seems to fade with a long caw of 'Nooooo!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You raise the pipe, ready to strike it again, but find that the end of it has been so blackened by the dark power that it's crumbling away. There are a few clicks and the three parts unlock and fall apart, once again trapping whatever that was. With the pipe still falling apart, you bump the three sections to opposite ends of the room and turn your attention to Solstice.";
			say "     Whatever just happened, whether some bizarre effect of the infection or some strange, magical power, it has left a profound impact on the vixen. Her upper body has been turned into that of a crow, with a largely corvid head, taloned hands like a bird's foot and black feathers across her upper half. There are still some subtle signs of her previous vulpine nature as well, with foxish ears on her head and mammalian breasts filling her red shirt. Her lower body is largely unchanged, though the tips of her tails now end in black plumage.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     She groans and rubs her head. 'Stupid, stupid fox. Rule number one of treasure hunting: Artifacts are [italic type]always[roman type] cursed.' She gets back to her feet slowly, looking over her body. Her talons run through her feathers and she moans softly, clearly finding sensual pleasure in her new form. Stretching her wings and stroking her breasts, she turns back to you. 'Now, I do believe I promised you a reward, sweetie,' she purrs sensually, a lustful glint in her eyes that wasn't there before.";

Moving over to the small bedroll she's set up here, she shucks her top and shorts quickly, spreading her intriguing body out for you to see. Her lovely breasts are covered in soft, black feathers and her nipples are silvery spots half-hidden beneath that soft down. Looking lower, the feathers transition back to fur at her slender waist. As your eyes travel further, she spreads her legs and teases her wet pussy with a moan. The soft, gray fur of her muff parts to show the dark lips of her waiting sex. She grins at the corners of her beak, crooking a finger for you to approach and get your [']reward['].";

You run your hands over her, enjoying the sensual way her body moves against your as you thrust into her. Her vulpine cunt squeezes and milks at you until you can take no more and thrust deep inside her to unleash your hot load, making her caw in orgasmic release.";

You turn around, bringing your pussy over her head while you continue to delve your tongue into her. It takes her a bit of work to get her beak into a position to please you comfortably, but her tongue darts out to lap at your folds while her taloned paws stroke you and slide into your cunt. You dive your tongue in deeper while she fingers you, licking up what flowing juices she can get. You both continue like this until you both cry out in orgasmic pleasure, Solstice cawing loudly in release. Her vulpine cunt squeezes and milks at your tongue as you drive it into her quickly and she pumps her fingers hard and fast into your quivering hole until you both collapse, panting for breath and wet with female juices.";

Before you head out, she gives you another kiss and a pat on the behind, saying she'll see you again soon. It's not until you're well on your way that you remember that you never got those supplies from her.
