She's quite dubious of the offer for safe haven at the police station, but she goes along with it rather than try to maintain the goodwill of the lustful tribes forming around her place, whom she trusts even less as they descend further into depravity.

When I was young, there was only the post office which my parents managed, a small shop that sold groceries and a petrol station. We had a police building too I suppose, but barely. The nearest medical practice was several hours drive away, so if you got hurt you were reliant on someone's mother to having a look at you and decide whether or not they could patch you up or that someone was going to have to rush you to a hospital with your blood staining the seats of their truck. We were a close community, perhaps too close but I can't remember anyone looking too obviously inbred.

My parents gave me a small amount of money so I could make a life somewhere else, and I heard at how nice California was, so I came here and started a course on nursing, doing waitressing to help pay the fees. After I completed the course, top of my class I might add, I started looking for employment at the hospital here, but they weren't hiring so I had to decide whether to find another job here while I waited, or look further afield. After a few days of lying around at home thinking about how I missed my mother, I decided I would try some of the doctors around the city. Everyone of them I went to didn't have any jobs going. Dr. Fuchs I think he was called, could only afford the salary of the one nurse who assisted him, and Dr. Medea at the pediatrics clinic already had sufficient staff for her needs.'";

Then the transformed started rampaging around and my chances of paid work flew south for the winter. After I found out that the hospital had become a sex trap, I thought that I could perhaps use my medical knowledge to help people in exchange for food and water, all I had to do was [']borrow['] some of their supplies that they weren't using. It didn't go very well. I got rather badly bitten by one of the patients on my way out and then the staff were adamant that they had to treat me. The rest you know. I thought it was about to be a change from naughty nurses to perverted policemen, but you and Alexandra have done alright I suppose. You haven't disappointed me too much so I think I made the right choice. But haven't you got heroic acts to be doing? Go on, we can talk another time.'";

Working her tongue and palate, she's quite enthusiastic about blowing you, working her muzzle over your [Cock of Player] manhood while her paws stroke the base of your shaft[if CockName of Player is not listed in infections of InternalCockList], your balls[end if] and your hips. Your breathing gets heavy and your penis pulses and throbs in her mouth as your excitement builds under her tender care. Eventually you can no longer hold back and, with a moan of 'Oh nurse!' you unload your [Cum Load Size of Player] load into her sucking maw[if Ball Size of Player < 30]. She swallows it all down eagerly, licking away the last drops before releasing your spent shaft[else]. She swallows as much of it as she can, but it's too much and some ends up overflowing from her pretty muzzle and dripping down onto her bosom before you're finally spent[end if].";

Stretching her arms up above her head, she gives an exaggerated sigh, giving you a clear view of her twin pairs of breasts. The soft, silvery fur of her chest does not hide the shapely nature of her double-bosom and their perky nipples.";
	say "     Dropping to her knees, she takes hold of your erection and, after giving it a few playful strokes, nestles it in her warm bosom. Her twin racks cradle your [cock size desc of Player] member in their soft embrace. Pointing her muzzle down, she kisses your glans before slipping her lips around it. She grinds her chest against your shaft in this delightful manner. You put a hand on the vixen's head and caress her ears.";
	say "     She works your arousal between her tits, gently pressing them around it with her paws. Soon this treatment has you panting and rocking your hips into her motion. Sensing you getting close, she lowers her muzzle further and sucks on you harder. A few final licks finishes the job, causing you to groan in lustful release, pumping your [Cum Load Size of Player] load into her warm, sucking muzzle. She licks your shaft clean with a self-satisfied sigh before getting back up and closing up her shirt with a professional air.";

'Looking to pound the naughty nurse, are you?' she says sensually, shifting her position to leave herself open and ready for just that. With the lovely vixen holding you lined up with her wet pussy, you ease forward and sink your [cock size desc of Player] manhood into her[if Cock Length of Player > 36] with some effort[else if Cock Length of Player > 24] with some effort at first[end if]. And once you're in, her paws move to your ass and grip it firmly, pulling you forward to thrust into her heated cunny.";
	say "     After exchanging some kisses and setting up a good rhythm for both of you, you bring your hands to her upper pair of breasts to fondle them while she gropes her lower pair. Seeing you both enjoying her furry mounds while you fuck her is quite the arousing sight and your cock throbs and pulses inside her, precum leaking with every thrust you make. And from the way she's panting and moaning, she's really enjoying it as well. The sexy vixen wraps a leg around behind you and raises her hips up into each thrust you make.";
	say "     The scent of sex and vulpine arousal is heavy in the air as you feel a pressure building in your balls. With your hot cum primed for release, you grab her hips and drive yourself into her for a few last thrusts. And when you finally pop and start unloading your [Cum Load Size of Player] load into her quivering cunny, she arches her back and cries out, her orgasm set off by your release. Panting, moaning and yipping come from you both as you paint the sultry nurse's vagina and womb with your seed[if Ball Size of Player > 6] until it overflows from her[end if] in a sticky mess. After taking a few minutes to recover, you pull out and are treated to the vixen sucking your cock clean before she'll give you a clean bill of health and send you on your way.";

'Here, let me have a look at that,' she says. 'Hmm... yes, indeed,' she adds, leaning in closer to give your wet folds a long, slow lick. And that lick is followed by another and then another. Soon she's wriggling that vulpine tongue of hers around inside your cunny, eating out your snatch with obvious relish.";
	say "     You place a hand on the vixen's head, caressing those pointed ears of hers. This encourages her to place a few fingers on your clit and tease at it as well. Her other hand finds its way between her own legs and a few fingers slip into her wet cunt. She frigs herself with soft moans of enjoyment as her tongue plays around along your inner walls. Her tongue moves in luxurious ways, teasing any inner pleasure spot it can find in her attempt to satisfy her partner.";
	say "     Subject to this fine tonguework, you can only last so long before tilting your head back and crying out in lustful release. Your hot femcum flows across the lapping vixen's tongue. The hand between her legs moves frantically, soon pushing her to orgasm as well. The added zeal she applies to licking and kissing your clit at this point rekindles your climax to a second peak. You're both left panting and very damp at the crotch from your orgasms by the time she pulls away. She teasingly declares your examination done and gives your rear a swat as you hop down from the examination table.";

She moans softly as your tongue runs across her juicy folds. Her hips quiver and her pussy grows wetter as you give her a few licks. Running your hand along her raised thigh, you stroke her soft fur on your way to give her ass a squeeze. As your tongue probes deeper and your free hand moves to play with her clit, she pants and moans louder, stroking a paw over your head while the other plays with her breasts.";
	say "     You pause for a moment to take in the lovely sight of the sexy vixen breathing heavily as her excitement builds, her lovely quartet of breasts moving with every breath. But as beautiful as it is, your tongue is drawn back to the scent and taste of her dripping cunny. Diving back in with greater zeal, you play your tongue across her sensitive petals, into her quivering depths and across her firm clit. Eventually the oral assault proves to be too much for the vixen, driving her to a moaning, yipping climax that has her hot juices dripping from your chin by the time you're done and she's left sated.";
