Her brown and green scaled body is only barely covered by the red disco dress she wears, exposing most of her bosom. It is made of smooth satin with rhinestones around bell-bottom-like wide ankles and pleated waves over her shoulders. The large afro behind her armored frill, the big sunglasses and high platform shoes complete the look. This double blast-from-the-past strikes a pose and strides to the beat, ready to mop the dance floor with you.";

Her saurian paws run over your body, going for the triceratops cock she can smell enticing her. With a few strokes, she has you to full hardness, then slips herself out of her beautiful dress. She lowers herself down onto your cock, taking you in to her wide pussy with a loud moan of pleasure. She grips your shoulders and writhes atop you, moving her body to a beat that you can't quite hear. Your bodies move in time as her inner walls squeeze and tug at your cock in rhythm to her motions, exciting you further. Eventually, you can take no more and shoot your hot seed deep inside the beautiful female riding you. After panting to recover, she pulls herself up and off of you. She then grabs you and pulls you up, shoving you on your way. As you stagger off, she returns to dancing to that unheard beat.";

She reaches down and grabs your head roughly with one of her large, saurian hands, jamming it between her thighs. The scent of her wet pussy fills your nose and soon you are compelled to lick at it. As you lap at her dripping folds, she rocks her body with a quickening rhythm. Her hot juices flow out over your face as she cries out 'Ah yeah, baby!' in climax.

			say "     You can feel a growing rhythm in your mind, almost like music. You start to follow that funky beat, drawing you through the city. As you travel, you spot a clothing store display and break into it, wanting the clothes on display. With your change in attire, you continue on, eventually coming to the museum, striding in with confidence. You snap your fingers and stride to the beat playing in your mind. Your platform shoes echo in the antechamber as you start to dance. The sphinx at the front desk watches you with an inscrutable expression, but it is not for her you are dancing. When the rhythm of your steps is matched by that of another, the female triceratops striding into the room from one of the museum halls, then your dance can begin in earnest with your partner.";
			say "     You stride meaningfully across the room towards her, stepping to the rhythm. She dances tantalizingly as you come over to her. With your arms around her, you both start to dance with energy, kissing and touching each other between the moves of your passionate mating dance[if Player is male]. Your funky, lime-green bellbottoms rock to the motion of your hips while your tail sways behind you. Half-open over your chest is a large-collared shirt, resplendent in colors and patterns to draw the female's eye and she is clearly pleased with your bright, vibrant plumage. You strike a pose, swaying your hips and pointing, indicating to head further into the museum. With a grin, she strides off, her shoes still tapping out the beat while you move in time after her, following her to her nest, soon to be the love nest of you both[else]. Resplendent in your lime-green wrap dress, you sway your hips and while your tail moves behind you. You have sets of hoop earrings that you've turned into golden rings to adorn your upper horns. You strike a pose and the other female moves up beside you, without exchanging a glance, you both dance and stride down the museum halls in search of dance partners so you may fill your shared nest with eggs[end if].";

			say "     After leaving military custody, you settle into a rather boring daytime life of office work. It fills your day and earns your money, but you have no passion for it. You continue like this for a time, until one evening you hear music faintly from the corner of your ear. You follow it, coming to a small club off the beaten path. You would have completely missed it had not someone exited at that moment to free the sound. You go in and are met with music, lights and sights that breath life into you, filling you with energy. Your style, always seeming outdated to the rest of the world, fits right in here. You stride out onto the flashing dance floor under the disco ball and take center stage, stealing the show with your moves and rhythm. Despite your altered appearance, your disco dancing breaks down all barriers and you are a star.";

When a few grow heavy and eventually bear eggs, despite not being saurian, you can only smile and dance all the more, filled with the dance of life.";
