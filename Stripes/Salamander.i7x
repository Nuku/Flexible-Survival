Her body is especially effeminate, with wide hips, thighs, and a thin waist that clamours for attention. Her breasts are quite modest, being pert B-cups. Her arms and legs look quite human, but flex a little more than normal, making her seem sinuous and agile. Her fingers and toes terminate in small, dark claws. She possesses a flat, wide head with a mouth full of diminutive teeth. She has a long, narrow, fleshy tail mounted atop her soft and squishy ass cheeks. Making no effort to hide it, you can also see her moderately large pussy between her legs, wet and waiting.";
	say "     Her smooth skin is a rich red color with yellow and black speckling, predominantly across her breasts and extremities. A shimmer of intense heat radiates from it intensely enough to make the air ripple around her. It seems the nanites have jumbled the old myths of salamanders with its amphibian nature, making this creature into one suitable for two environments, on land and in lava.";

With her hot juices dripping down onto your mouth, you can't help yourself and dive into licking her smooth-skinned snatch. Already muddleheaded and aroused by effects of her slime, the taste of her pussy overwhelms you. Your tongue plunges into her cunt and licks at her clit as you lap up every drop you can get of her delicious juices[if player is herm].
