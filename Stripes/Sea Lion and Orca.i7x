The sea lion gives a squeezing bark which is answered by a trill from the orca, at which point they both rush you from opposite sides. They are attacking you together, the male striking from the ground and trying to trip up your legs while the female floats in the air, trying to push your body over from the other direction. Either on their own [if level of player > 6]wouldn't be more than an annoyance, but together they're a bit of a hassle[else if level of player > 3]wouldn't be much trouble, but together they're more effective than some of the other inflatables you've seen[else]would be a bit of a hassle, but together they're much more of a threat[end if].";
