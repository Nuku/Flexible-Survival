	else:
		say "     Battered by their soft, but insistent, blows, you are knocked off your feet onto the padded floor. They quickly flop down atop you, pinning you down.";

to say beattheslao:
	say "     Your blows to the duo of inflatable toys is finally enough to weaken them to the point that they've both sprung leaks and deflated enough to flop down on the ground. Unable to keep fighting, they squirm over to one another for comfort while their hides mend and they reinflate. Successful, you're free to move on.";

to say slaoattack:
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:	[male sea lion]
		say "[one of]The sea lion[or]The purple inflatable[or]The plump male[at random] [one of]bumps against one of your legs[or]noses firmly at your groin[or]presses his large body against your legs[or]grabs onto your hips with his flippers and humps your leg with his inflated penis[at random], making you stumble on the unsteady footing of the padded floor.";

Section 2 - Creature Insertion

to say slaodesc:
	say "     You find yourself facing off against two inflatable sea animals at once, a male sea lion and a female orca. The former is an opaque purple in color and the latter is a translucent magenta. The sea lion gives a squeezing bark which is answered by a trill from the orca, at which point they both rush you from opposite sides. They are attacking you together, the male striking from the ground and trying to trip up your legs while the female floats in the air, trying to push your body over from the other direction. Either on their own [if level of Player > 6]wouldn't be more than an annoyance, but together they're a bit of a hassle[else if level of Player > 3]wouldn't be much trouble, but together they're more effective than some of the other inflatables you've seen[else]would be a bit of a hassle, but together they're much more of a threat[end if].";
