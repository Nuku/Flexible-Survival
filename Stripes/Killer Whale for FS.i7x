Section 1 - Monster Responses

to say losetoorca:
	say "     The Killer Whale is suddenly on top of you, forcing you to your back as his long, curving cock begins to slip free from the slit between his legs. 'Suck it!' The command is a given in a deep rumble";
	if libido of player > 40:
		say ".  You are suddenly only too happy to oblige as your lustful urges drive you to take the tip of the whale cock into your mouth. You begin to eagerly suck at him as he slides himself in and out of your mouth";
	otherwise:
		say ".  Not so eager to do what he says, he grips your jaw, forcing your mouth open and ramming his stiff cock down your throat";
	if cunts of player > 0:
		say ".  He thrusts into your mouth a few times, but once it's fully engorged, he slides that slick, flexible member from your throat and pushes you over.  Sliding atop you, he keeps you pinned with his massive body and spreads your legs apart with his muscular tail.  He drives his cock into your pussy, squirming and wiggling his flexible member around inside you like some meaty tentacle as he pounds into you.";
		if hasgills is 1:
			say "     Holding you under the water, you are thankful for your gills and breathe through them.  Without the distraction of drowning, you quickly start to enjoy the strange sensation of that wriggling inside you.  The orcaman's slick shaft slides along your walls and probes at the depths of your pussy before pushing past your cervix and worming its way into your womb.  As you writhe in pleasure beneath him as this strange sensation drives you to climax, he starts filling your uterus with his thick, virile orca cum.";
		otherwise:
			say "     Holding you under the water, you struggle to hold your breath as each hard thrust he makes into you seeks to push the air from your lungs.  You can feel his throbbing, wriggling cock inside you.  It is very enjoyable and arousing despite your desperate situation.  Your desire for air, your struggle to live, somehow makes it all the more exciting.  It is as if some primal part of you wants you to live so that you may breed and have children.  So when the orca cums inside you, forcing his way into your womb and filling it with his seed, you orgasm powerfully as that primal need is fulfilled even.  You can feel him pumping blast after blast of his thick, virile orca cum into you even as you're starting to black out.";
		say "[impregchance]";
		say "     When he's finished draining his large balls into you, his flexible cock pulls itself from your stuffed, bloated womb and he releases you.  The Killer Whale departs, leaving you floating on your back in a stupor.";
	otherwise:
		say ".  He keeps up the eager violation of your throat, occasionally making pleased clicking noises. As you feel his cock begin to throb against your tongue, he pulls out. Finishing himself off with a few last strokes of his shaft, he showers you with a spray after spray of orca cum.  His seed is thick and clings to you even in the water, only slowly dissolving away... or perhaps seeping into your skin.  The Killer Whale departs, leaving you floating on your back in a stupor.";


to say beattheorca:
	if ( libido of player - humanity of player > 15 ) and bodyname of player is "Killer Whale" and cocks of player > 0:
		say "     Having defeated the muscled orca, you growl down at him, feeling your strange, lustful instincts taking over.  You climb atop the woozy male and grab him firmly.  'These waters are my territory,' you growl to him as you grab him into a headlock.  With him tightly held, you grind your throbbing [cockname of player] cock against his ass, pushing it under his tail.  He struggles weakly, but has little strength left after battling you.  After a few teasing taps against his tailhole, you drive yourself into him, making the powerful male moan.  You pump your hard shaft into him again and again, asserting your dominance over the male.  The act is primally enjoyable as you lay claim to your territory and satisfy your lustful urges on the powerful orca.  You try to draw it out, enjoying the lustful moans that the big, tough male starts releasing despite himself, but eventually you can hold back no longer.  You cum hard into him, enjoying the tight grip as his ass clenches around you as he cums, wasting his heavy seed in the water as he's lost this fight for dominance.";
		say "     After you withdraw your spent shaft, you give the beaten Killer Whale a hard swat on his sore rump and send him off to look for other waters to hunt in.  You smile happily, having driven off one of those seeking to claim your territory.";
		increase orcadom by 1;
	otherwise:
		say "     Having beaten the muscled orca, you leave him woozy and floating in the water as you swim away.";

to say orcadesc:
	say "     Looking over Killer Whale, his body is covered in the destinctive patterning of an orca on thick, sleek flesh.  His head is sleek and streamlined, drawing to the rounded blunt muzzled shape of an orca.  His mouth is filled with small sharp, dagger-like teeth.  The blow hole on the top of his head ocasionally opens to take a breath. His body is large and heavily muscled, but with the sleek shape of a swimmer.  He stands easily ten feet tall.  The large dorsal fin projecting from his back extends nearly a foot behind him in a sharp knife-like shape.  His arms are dense with sleek muscle.  His hands have a thick webbing between his fingers.  His legs are humanoid in appearance, thick with powerful muscle.  His ass is dense with muscle, supporting a thick and very muscular tail 4 feet in length ending in a whale's flukes.  Between his powerful, swimmer's legs he has a titanic, sleek and curving cetacean cock.  Beneath his impressive maleness is a large bulge, showing his swollen balls.  While they would normally be internal on the oceanic creature, their apparent hugeness cannot be fully contained inside him and bulge out considerably.";

You join the other beachgoers and lose yourself in the enjoyment of the beachfront area.  You swim among the other creatures, strong and powerful.  You are not troubled by the other predators often and happily satisfy your urges on the others swimming in the area";

				say ".  Having driven away several of the other muscled orcamen from the area, the territory is yours and you have little trouble driving away the other weaker males.  With the territory near the city claimed as yours, you build up a large pod of females to breed.  Those killer whales who do venture into your waters are quickly beaten and dominated as you did the others before them.";

He breeds you, and the other females of the pod, often, to add to his mates.  The males, when mature, are driven off to find pods of their own.

There is some interest in you and the others and they get several marine biologist to study your group.  Several members of the military speak to you as well.  At first, it seems their interest is casual, but you soon catch on to what they're doing and you start talking to the others when they're not around.  You argue against the military's offer to work for them, instead telling them you know someone who would be interested in their services and that he can help them with their infection.  You keep your promises vague, but work to undermine the military's otherwise tempting offer to those who would otherwise feel they have no possible future.  In the end, the military is only able to recruit a few of the people kept in your group, and predominantly those with lesser infections.  Those more greatly infected and with more powerful bodies were more easily swayed by you.";
				say "     After your release, you keep in contact with the most promising of those you spoke with, content to simply leave the others out of military control.  When Dr. Mouse gets in touch with you, you relay your information to him and he happily thanks you for the addition of what will soon become his aquatic research material and sea forces to further his plans.  Among the group is a shark-infected person who has managed to retain enough of their mind while being transformed enough to be quite powerful.  You become mates and your hydrid children are composites of you both, strong and vicious.  As they grow, you teach them to be powerful sea fighters and carry out raids upon coastal cities and towns or marine research facilities on any tasks the little mouse doctor needs taken care of by his loyal assistant and his aquatic family.";

You become strong friends and eventual mated to a shark creature who is also in your group, one of the few who could overcome their more vicious and piratical tendancies while still being transformed enough and willing enough to join the para-military group.  While your hybrid children are even more aquatic in nature than their parents and are a little more wild and vicious, they are trained from a young age by the yourselves and the military to become powerful grunts in the military's coastal defense teams.";
