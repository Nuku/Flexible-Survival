This is the Mismatched Chimera Infection rule:
	if Player has a body of "Mismatched Chimera":
		trigger ending "Mismatched Chimera Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			say "     As your identity collapses, you are left with your fractured mind and instincts. Lacking any true focus to your instincts, you wander the city in a haze. You pass from one territory group to another, mating with the creatures there, but never transforming further, remaining a mismatched hodgepodge of creatures. Several try to keep you as a mate or prisoner, but you always escape eventually and move on. Your existence is aimless and with little conscious thought, but filled with sex of endless variety from all those you meet.";
			if "Sterile" is not listed in feats of Player and player is female:
				say "     Your womb gives birth of a wide array of hybrid children over the years. Some are taken and assimilated into other groups, but some go on to form new species in their own right, adding to the variety of lovers for you to mate with over the centuries of your strangely unending life. You are one of the few constants in this ever-changing world and exist as an eternal source for much of this new life which you bear witness to until the end of time.";
			else if Player is male:
				say "     You sire a wide array of hybrid children over the years. Some are taken and assimilated into other groups, but some go on to form new species in their own right, adding to the variety of lovers for you to mate with over the centuries of your strangely unending life. You are one of the few constants in this ever-changing world and exist as an eternal source for much of this new life which you bear witness to until the end of time.";
			else:
				say "     You watch time march on over the centuries, taking lovers from the various new species and races that continually form from the intermingling of the infected groups. They rise and fall around you, adding to the variety of lovers for you to mate with over the centuries of your strangely unending life. You are one of the few constants in this ever-changing world and exist as an eternal witness to the variety of life until the end of time.";
		else:
			say "     After your rescue from the city, you are left aimless and take frequently to wandering the world for extended periods. Your altered, hybrid body makes you stand out always, but you can always seem to find companionship for a time, perhaps drawn in by the medley of pheromones you emit. You take on temporary dalliances of all kinds on these journeys, loving to experience the endless variety of lovers this world can provide to you. You are never changed by these lovers, no matter how infected or mindless these may be.";
			if "Sterile" is not listed in feats of Player and player is female:
				say "     Your womb gives birth to a wide array of hybrid children over the years. Some, you are pleased to see, give rise to new species in their own right, adding to the variety of lovers for you to mate with over the centuries of your strangely unending life. Even as your old friends and allies pass on, you continue your eternal drifting across the globe. You are always drifting discreetly through the world in your search to experience the ever-changing array of life rising and falling on this planet. You are one of the few constants in this ever-changing world and exist as an eternal source for much of this new life which you bear witness to until the end of time.";
			else if Player is male:
				say "     You sire a wide array of hybrid children over the years. Some, you are pleased to see, give rise to new species in their own right, adding to the variety of lovers for you to mate with over the centuries of your strangely unending life. Even as your old friends and allies pass on, you continue your eternal drifting across the globe. You are always drifting discreetly through the world in your search to experience the ever-changing array of life rising and falling on this planet. You are one of the few constants in this ever-changing world and exist as an eternal source for much of this new life which you bear witness to until the end of time.";
			else:
				say "     You watch time march on over the centuries, taking on new lovers wherever you go, enjoying their company for a time before leaving and continuing on. The various species and races of the infected groups rise and fall over time, adding to the variety of lovers for you to mate with over the centuries of your strangely unending life. Even as your old friends and allies pass on, you continue your eternal drifting across the globe. You are always drifting discreetly through the world in your search to experience the ever-changing array of life rising and falling on this planet. You are one of the few constants in this ever-changing world and exist as an eternal source for much of this new life which you bear witness to until the end of time.";
