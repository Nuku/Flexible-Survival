You find yourself wanting more and lick at his dribbling glans before welcoming his cock into your mouth. You moan in pleasure as that ridged length slides past your lips and over your tongue before pressing its tapered glans down your throat. He presses one of his forepaws at the back of your head, encouraging you to bob your head over his meat as he fucks your face with increasing fervor. You reach up and knead his hefty balls until he finally cums, feeding you a heavy load of his exotically tasting semen. As he's finishing up, he pushes your head back roughly, letting the last few spurts of his seed spray across your face, marking you as having been used by him. Once he's done, you're left feeling full from his large load but still eagerly licking at the cum running down your face for more.";

You vary your pace and position several times, riding through several small orgasms while always building yourself higher and not letting the dragon get off.

Finding himself face to penis with you, he tries to pull back, but you keep a firm grip on his horn with one hand. You slap your cock across his face with the other and order him to get sucking.
