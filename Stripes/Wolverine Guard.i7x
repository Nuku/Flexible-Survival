				say "     You find your growing urge to protect and defend your post increasing. Joining James at the Central Library, you become his mate and share the duty with him. He accepts him place now, no longer fighting his powerful body. Most of the time, you both guard it together, though occasionally alone so the other can get a brief nap. As with that first time, you rut often on the library steps. The lustful growls of your animalistic sex carry far, warning any would be interlopers away. You eventually bear him some kits, who grow big and strong like their parents and take up the duty to protect the library as well. You live peaceably with the librarians inside, guarding their home and leaving them undisturbed. There is some commotion when the soldiers come through the city, but you, your mate and your offspring are able to drive them off, protecting your post.";
			else:
				say "     You find your growing urge to protect and defend your post increasing. Cutting short your wandering, you head back to the bunker at the Abbey to clear your head. Once there, you decide to scout around from top to bottom, making sure it's secure before you relax. You find nothing, but still remain on edge, and patrol on guard for any disturbances. You keep at your post, staying on watch without rest, protecting it from the monsters of the city and the soldiers who later arrive. You keep it, and its contents, safe from interlopers day after day.";

				say "     When the military enters the city and rescue you and the other survivors, you recall another wolverine you met. Telling them about James, you give them information on how to take him calmly, with a soldier disguised in a company jacket and a call from the security company's headquarters relayed through the military network, they convince him to switch assignments. He joins you in one of the military staging camps, happy to see a friendly face[if Player is female]. You share a good romp with him that evening[end if].";
				say "     The security company, now involved, helps to get you both cleared. Your idea was able to rescue several of their employees and they offer to hire you on as well. You and James get partnered with ";

If anything, it's another strong deterrent for any unwanted visitors. Your trio makes a fine partnership, with the off-duty pair eager to spend time with one another. ";

			else if HP of Doctor Matt <= 100:
				say "     You hold out until the rescue comes and you are taken in by the military. You wait impatiently for your release, always on edge and feeling that there's something you should be doing. You are eventually moved into the care of Dr. Matt, who has you alternate with Orthas as his personal guard at the research station the military sets him up at to combat the spreading infection. While on duty, you are tireless in your vigil, protecting your post and feeling a sense of fulfillment from doing so.";

				say "     You hold out until the rescue comes and you are taken in by the military. With your false identity never questioned, you wait impatiently for your release, always on edge and feeling that there's something you should be doing. One day, you are released and are quickly picked up by a large van. You are quietly taken to where Dr Mouse is hiding, apparently having funneled some bribes through a third party to gain custody of you. He takes you on as his private security guard, watching over him as he conducts his secret research. He works for a variety of foreign countries and infected factions[if susan is in hidden lab]. Susan continues to accompany him as an assistant and a lover for you when off duty[end if]. While on duty, you are tireless in your vigil, protecting your post and feeling a sense of fulfillment from doing so.";
