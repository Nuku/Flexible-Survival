The are growling and slavering as they snap at each other or swinging their briefcases around.  Mixed among the pack are several smaller wolves in skirts or shirts, clutching reports, pouring coffee or helping the larger ones.  Much of the helping seems to take the form of the interns sucking them off or getting pounded good and hard by one of the bigger males.  Unwilling to face a legal teeth of a pack of rabid lawyers, you slink off as quietly and as quickly as you can.";

Instead of resolving a Pigging Out:
	say "     You come to a very exclusive restaurant.  While you[apostrophe]ve never been there, you[apostrophe]ve heard that reservations are required months in advance and that the cuisine is both wonderful and expensive.  With the fall of the city, you know you won[apostrophe]t be able to order a meal there, but you may be able to get some fine food from the cold locker.  As you get closer, you hear some noise coming from the restaurant and approach more cautiously.  Glancing through one of the large windows, you see a large sow inside, making a mess of the place.  It looks like she has been eating and masturbating all over the place.  One hand holds a fistful of food while the other fingers her dripping pussy.";
	say "[piggycheck]";
	if tempnum is 1:
		say "     Eyeing both her and the food, you lick your lips hungrily.  You feel the urge to join her in the restaurant.  Besides, wouldn[apostrophe]t the experience of eating at the best restaurant in town be better with an attractive date?";
		if the player consents:
			say "     When you first step in, the pig is somewhat startled by your presence.  Her heavy bulk struggles to get up, but she soon relaxes and smiles as she sees your piggish features and eager attitude.  With a grin, she picks up a handful of food from the floor with her left hand, the one she[apostrophe]d had in her pussy.  As you reach for it, you can see her wet juices running over the sugary dessert, making your mouth water for it all the more.  You stuff the food into your mouth, chewing noisily as you enjoy its added seasoning.";
			say "     As you eat, she helps you out of your clothes, tossing them onto a knocked over table.  With you now naked, she runs her messy hands over your body as she pulls you into her arms.  She grabs another of the scattered pastries from the floor and stuffs it into her mouth before sloppily kissing you, smearing the creamy filling into your mouth with her tongue.";
			if cocks of player > 0:
				say "     You place your hands on her sow tits, making her squeal in pleasure.  She lays herself back on the floor, squishing some of the expensive food beneath her bulk.  You bury your face in her teats, licking and suckling at them playfully.  She oinks and moans in pleasure between mouthfuls.  You work your way down her chest, tending to each of her six breasts until that brings you between her legs and that wet, cavernous slit beacons to you.";
				say "     You grab a nearby bottle of maple syrup and tear off the top, pouring it right onto those wet lips before you bury your face between her large thighs.  You lick all over her messy pussy, the maple sweetness tasting wonderful with her porcine juices.  You stuff your tongue into her, delving deeper for more of her sweet honey until she finally orgasms and soaks your face with it.";
				say "     You smile up at her, licking your chops as she motions for you to climb atop her.  You do so eagerly, bringing your hard cock into position at her pussy before burying it in her ample folds.  With your face pressed to her piggish snout, she snuffles at your face and licks away the sticky syrup and her own juices with squeals of pleasure as you fuck her.";
				say "     When she[apostrophe]s finished cleaning your face, you stuff another large pastry into her mouth and share it with her while kissing.  Her plump body ripples with each hard thrust you make into her.  You pound into her again and again until finally you climax, shooting your hot seed into her womb, making her squeal again.";
				say "     Your romp with her continues for several hours. Between gorging and fucking, you feel quite full and satisfied when you both finally part ways.";
			otherwise:
				say "     She presses you down to the floor, flattening several soft pastries beneath you.  She moves her heavy bulk atop you, bringing her wet and dripping pussy over you face.  You moan softly as she presses it to your mouth, smearing her juices onto you, which you quickly start lapping up from her pussy.";
				say "     With her atop you, you barely catch sight of her grabbing a bottle of maple syrup.  A few moments later, you feel the cool, sticky fluid flowing down between your legs.  She spreads your petals and pours more over them before burying her snout between your thighs and licking hungrily at your sticky puss.  You both moan and squeal in pleasure until you climax, adding more hot juices to the sticky mess.";
				say "     She pauses to stuff several more pastries into her mouth, gobbling them down.  She ends up dropping crumbs onto your sticky groin where they cling to the syrupy, slobbery film of your juices.  After her quick gorging, she climbs off of you and goes to the back and into the food locker.  At first you think she[apostrophe]s going to come out with more food for you both, but when she comes out with only a cucumber and a grin, you realize she has something else in mind.";
				say "     She plops herself down onto the messy floor, seating herself between your legs.  Stroking your thigh, she moves her piggy hand up to your wet, messy cunny and spreads your lips.  With a grin, she sinks the long, slender cucumber into you, making you squeal.  She works the vegetable in and out several times before she lays back, one leg over yours and the other under.  With considerable labour, she moves her heavy bulk closer, taking the other half of the cuke into her pussy.";
				say "     With a little careful practice, you both set up a nice rhythm where you rock back and forth, pushing the cuke into each other over and over again.  You both fondle your breasts and stuff more of the scattered desserts into your hungry mouths.  A wet puddle of juices pool beneath it as your pleasure builds and builds until you finally crash over the edge and she follows a few breaths later.  You both writhe in orgasm, eventually snapping the green vegetable in half as you squeal loudly.";
				say "     Your romp with her continues for several hours. Between gorging and fucking, you feel quite full and satisfied when you both finally part ways, with you munching on your half of the sticky cucumber and she doing the same with hers.";

Once she[apostrophe]s satisfied that you[apostrophe]re properly set to work, she starts stuffing handfuls of food into her piggish snout with oinks of pleasure.
