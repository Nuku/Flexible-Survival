You can see signs of a fire on one side, blackened with soot.  As you get closer, about to cross the street to approach the entrance, you spot a burly security guard on the steps between the stone lions.  A large, muscled fellow covered in dark fur and battered jacket.  It is one of those crazed wolverines you've seen in the area guarding with manic obsession and great violence.";
		say "     Spotting you, the wolverine does not immediately attack, but seems to be struggling with himself.  He seems not to have fully succumbed to the viciousness that the others like him possess.  'Just... just stay back,' he calls over, warning you off.  'This place is sealed.  Just go away and I won't have to hurt you.'";
		say "     Keeping your distance, you manage to talk to him.  It seems he's done a good job keeping the area clear, so you're able to talk to him from across the street without worry about attracting attention.  'My name is... James.  It's James, dammit,' he growls, struggling to hang onto it.  'I live nearby and walked over to come on duty early in the morning.  I guess I didn't notice what was happening in the city since it was so early and the sun hadn't come up yet.  Or maybe I was already changing and was too focused on getting to work.  I remember being really gung-ho about guarding the library from the moment I put on my coat and went out the door.  Didn't matter that it wasn't even 5 a.m. that morning.'  He paces up and down the steps, looking down both sides of the deserted street and takes a deep breath to relax and refocus, letting you cross the street to join him on the steps.";
		say "     'Well, I started changing once I got here, slowly turning into the burly creature I am now.  I... it probably should have upset me, but I help feeling that it would only help me guard the library better.  And now I'm so young and strong.  Only problem's been that I can't leave my post because my replacement hasn't come to take his shift.  Can't leave it unguarded.  So many crazy creatures around now,' he says, growling a little in his throat.  'Gotta keep watch.  There's been no chance to sleep and only what little food the librarians might give me while I'm patrolling inside the library.  It's been getting harder and harder to keep it together.  Haven't slept since that morning.  Can't.  Gotta protect the library.  Gotta...' he trails off.";

Good to have someone who hasn't gone completely over the edge yet to talk to.'";
