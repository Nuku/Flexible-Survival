to say ResolveEvent Goblin Trap:
	say "     As you are traveling along, looking over the various junk piles as you go, you inadvertently set off a hidden trap. A snare closes around your ankles and pulls your feet out from under you as you hear a heavy weight strike the ground nearby, pulling the rope. This also sets off a spring trap which sends a cluster of machine parts at you, aimed to land at your location. Battered by the volley of junk, you try to extricate yourself from the snare as a giggling goblin scrambles out from his hidey-hole in the junkpile after you set off his trap. 'Hee hee! It worked! It worked! And now to claim my prize,' he cackles as he comes at you as you get your legs free. You have taken 12 damage.";

	say "     As you search through the junkyard, you can hear some cackling laughter coming closer as well as the sounds of an angry feline.

A few seconds later, some goblins come into view dragging something as they laugh cruelly to one another. The trio stops as they notice you just as their burden comes into view. Trapped in a net behind them is a tigress woman dressed in a skimpy outfit with mussed hair. She is largely insensate right now, probably struck by one of the goblins when she started making noise. With you barring their path, the goblin charges to defend their prize.";

				if goblinfight is 1:
					say "     With the last goblin fled, you move over to check on the tigress woman. Using the fight as a distraction, she managed to bite through some of the ropes and pulls herself free as you come up. As she stands, you get a better look at her. She is wearing a short, red top and an even shorter, black skirt. This lets you see the soft orange tiger fur that covers her attractive body, rich with black stripes. She has snowy, white fur that covers her bosom and the front of her shapely waist. As she brushes her red hair back into order, you catch sight of the gold earrings in her feline ears and bracelets on her wrists. She growls as she stomps down hard onto the net launcher, smashing it with her feline paw before sending it flying off into the scrapyard.";
					say "     Looking at you, she grins and runs her paws over her body. 'Well, sweetie, that was mighty nice of you. How about I give you a little reward for your help?' she purrs, motioning to a discarded mattress at the edge of a nearby pile. From the looks of it, it's been used a few times before. As her paws run over her skirt, you can see the bulge there of her poorly concealed maleness. 'No charge this time, sweetie,' the feline whore adds, running her paws over your chest. 'I can show you a real good time. Anything you like,' she rumbles with a grin, rubbing her breasts and sheath against you. Shall you accept her tempting offer?";

			say "     Beaten by the goblins, they close in you around and smack you a few times. They then send you on your way with more cackling before continuing on with their prize. You should perhaps consider yourself lucky that they already have one prize and can't take you with them as well.";

to say ResolveEvent Stripped Car:
	say "     You come across a stripped car that has been pulled across the pathway between the piles. Wary of an ambush, you look around, but it seems no one is here. Taking a closer look, stripped is the proper way to describe this car. It's hub caps, hood, side panels, front grill and many other parts seem to have all been recently and forcibly removed. There are deep gouges from feline claw marks and twisted metal all over it where parts where torn off. Even the stereo is gone. You will have to be careful to avoid any felines strong enough to drag around a car and tear parts off by hand.";

From the looks of it, it seems this stuff has been rummaged through and possibly even rolled around in. As it is just tossed around, there are clear spots to walk while you move through it.

It's hard to tell over the scent of the surrounding garbage, but it's clearly the sexual fluids from some kind of creature. Finishing picking around the trash, you do manage to find a container of water. The small jug has enough for a drink of water, but it seems to have been filled after the outbreak and is probably not clean.";

Your foot comes out from under you and you fall onto your back, landing among the trash in something sticky. Getting up quickly, you notice it is a puddle of sexual fluids from some kind of creature. You try to wipe it off, but it's clearly too late as the tingles and prickles of spreading infection start.";

The container breaks open, sending the water over him. Startled, he comes to a stop and shakes his head before realizing it's water and he starts licking it from his fur. As you start to back away, his body starts to change, altered by the dirty water.";
	say "     Fascinated, you watch as he starts to mewl softly as the sensations wash over him, causing him to fall to his knees. From the strength of his reactions, you are very grateful that you didn't end up drinking that water yourself. His body grows taller and thinner, but with a strong chest and shoulders. His shoulders and back twitch and bulge before a pair of large, fully-formed bat wings burst from them. The pain (or pleasure?) of this causes him to mrowl loudly. With his head raised to cry out, you can see his face and muzzle changing, growing longer and narrower. His ears enlarge, becoming big and pointed as he turns into some feline-bat hybrid.";
	say "     His bat-like ears twitch as he mrowls again and they lock on you. Hearing your echo with his heightened senses, he starts to get up. This breaks the spell of watching his transformation and you turn to get away from this new and potentially dangerous creature you've spawned. You run around one mound, then dash down another path in the hopes of evading him. You start to make a third turn when he comes swooping out of the air, already able to fly on his new wings. Cut off, you will have to face him.";
