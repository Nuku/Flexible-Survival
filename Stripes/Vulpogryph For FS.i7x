	now body change entry is "a strange lightness fills your bones, as if they're becoming light and hollow.  They shift and pop as your back spasms several times before large, avian wings start to emerge, growing from new limbs below your shoulderblades.  The changes spread to your arms, distorting their shape and turning your hands into bird-like talons.  As the changes reach your lower body, their manifestation changes, turning your lower body and legs into a more vulpine form and giving you fox-like footpaws";
	now skin change entry is "ripples spread across your changing flesh.  These spread in waves across your body, building in intensity each time until it stops.  As you pant for breath, not aware that you were holding it throughout, a final wave surges across you, spreading black feathers across your upper body and silvery fur down your lower half.  After this one, rapid burst, your new pelt is complete";
	now ass change entry is "your hips realign slightly to allow a fluffy, fox tail to emerge";
