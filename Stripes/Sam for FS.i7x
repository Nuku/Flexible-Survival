Picking up something odd about the sounds, you cut across the alley and peek out into the street.  There you find a canine finishing up in what appears to be an unchanged human male.  The guy being pounded spots you and blushes a little, motioning for you to be quiet and wait.  Expecting him to start changing soon, you prepare to back away, but even after the canine is done and gone, no infection appears.  The guy gets up slowly and starts rearranging his clothes, waving you over.  Confused but cautious, you approach him.";

	say "     He pauses to wipe his hand before offering it to you.  'The name's Sam.  So you're probably wondering what's going on,' he says as he motions for you to come along with him, to which you nod.  'I've been sent in as a researcher to study this strange outbreak.  It's actually being caused by strange nanites.  I don't really know where they came from or really much about them at all.  Most of it is over my head, really.  I'm just paid to go around and gather samples for pick up later.'";
	if scenario is "Researcher":
		say "     You inform him that you are here as a researcher yourself, which makes him smile all the more.  'Excellent!  I was sent in with a partner, but he got a little too friendly with the locals and started dipping into the vials,' he says, making a drinking motion with his hand.  'I hope he's happy as a kitty and all, but now I'm stuck doing the work for both of us.  Not that it's all bad.  I'm starting to like playing around with those sexy beasts,' he says, rubbing his recently fucked ass.  'Oh, I hope that's not a bad sign,' he jokes.";
	otherwise:
		say "     You start asking him why he's not turning into a dog right now, but he grins.  'Immunization resistance.  The university that's paying me's got a sponsorship deal with Zephyr, so they gave me some treatment to make me resistant.  Not a hundred percent guaranteed, you know, but it's held up for now.  Let's me work on this project and gather samples,' he says, holding up a small vial disgorged from his handheld device.  'Concentrated nanites courtesy of my erstwhile lover back there.  I must say, I wouldn't have gone for that sort of thing in the past, but I'm starting to like playing around with those sexy beasts,' he says, rubbing his recently fucked ass.  'Oh, I hope that's not a bad sign,' he jokes.";

	attempttowait;
	say "     Arriving at a run down home with boarded up windows, he motions you to quietly follow him around back and down through a door into the basement.  'I used to live near here.  This place has been boarded up for a few years, though the local teens knew how to get in.  Makes for a safe hiding spot to set up our temporary lab,' he says, closing the door behind you and leading you to the back of the room where a small research station's been set up.  'Now, the main reason I've asked you down here is to see if you might be willing to help me out with my work.  Since I'm a man down, I could use a hand gathering samples.  I've got a deadline to meet, but I can't run around the whole city to gather the samples and nanites by myself.  I hope you'll help me out.'";

	if hp of Sam <= 4:
		say "     Tucked into the corner of basement in the long-abandoned home, Sam has set up his mini-lab.  Here the researcher stores and analyzes the nanite and samples he's gathered out in the city.  His equipment's been set up on a small table with a dented folding chair for him to sit on.  There are numerous racks of labeled test tubes shaped vials on the table and more on a small bookshelf behind it.  The collection of vials seems quite impressive, with several marked with creatures you've not even seen yet.";
		say "     The basement itself isn't much to look at, having several broken bottles and lots of graffiti from having been used as a hang-out for the local kids.  It looks like Sam's made some effort to clean it up, but mainly in the form of sweeping the trash into a few corners";

With the their contents spilled onto the ground and walls in that area, something strange has started to occur.  The concrete walls in this corner have become flesh-like and shifting, with vague impressions of faces, muzzles and sexual organs.  These do not last long or ever fully form, but it seems the over-abundance of nanites are still at work.  Realizing that Sam could have very well ended up fused with that mess or been turned into an ambulatory monstrocity like that, you don't feel so bad about how things did turn out.  You back away from the pulsating wall-flesh as it reaches out with a grey psuedopod.  You decide not to risk coming here again once your business is through.";

The constant exercise of travelling around the city to fight and fuck monsters has toughened him up.  He's got brown hair and eyes.  There is a bit of stubble on his face, probably seeing little need to shave regularly out here.  At 21 years old and in university, he's been sent here as part of a research project to gather samples of the nanites.  He's [one of]hard at work at his lab station, running analyses on his recent acquisitions[or]taking a short break and stretched out on his sleeping bag[or]grabbing a quick snack[or]checking his gear before having to go out again[purely at random].";

His green scales darken towards the back of his head as they approach the base of ivory horns which jut from the back of his head.  There are three smaller horns to each side and a larger pair at the top.  His upper body is generally human in shape, but covered in green scales.  He's become quite toned through the change, his chest showing firm pecs and hard abs.  His hands are a cross between human hands and his more draconic clawed feet.";

Atop the back of his tauric body are a pair of draconic wings he keeps folded alongside his sides.  He has a long lizard tail ending in a spaded tip.
