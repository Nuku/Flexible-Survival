dolphinbundle is a number that varies. [Increases the difficulty of escaping the Inflatable Dolphin bound state, ranging from 0-2]
dolphinlist is a list of text that varies. [Creates a quasi-random pool of dolphins to check while searching for Bubble]
dolcastlefight is a number that varies. [Determines Bottlenose Toy scenes. 1 = win, 2 = loss (normal), 3 = loss (in castle)]

bcending is a number that varies. [Determines bad ends]
[Previously included dolcastleturn, which elapses 1 hour (turn/3) per empty dolphin suit checked. Since this was unrealistically long for something that would take a minute to do at most, I've removed the stat entirely]

As you crest the next sandy rise, you can see several bright pink dolphin girls playing with a vixen they've found. She's struggling a little, but her resistance becomes less and less as the playful inflatables tease her body while taking off what few scraps of clothes she has.

As the pink dolphins start sliding it over the vixen, she hardly struggles, the trio keeping her too lustful to quite notice what's going on until it's too late. Her arms are held to her sides as they start enclosing her in the large, inflatable cetacean. It's only as they're sealing her up completely in it that she starts to scream, but those are soon muffled somehow. The vixen, now fully encased in a dolphin-shaped inflatable, is carried into the water by the giggling girls. You watch as they pull her out to sea. You're confused by this at first, as they just seem to be floating her along, but you eventually spot a sky blue bouncy castle floating out on the water past the rocks that appears to be their destination.";
		say "     As you're watching all this, you continue walking along the beach. By the time you get to the site of the vixen's capture, you can see the dolphin girls pulling the buoyant inflatable into the castle to meet whatever fate the dolphins eventually have planned for her. You sort through the vixen's clothes and her small collection of gear. You don't spot anything of use to you, though you do find a small pad of notes the vixen seems to have been using to keep track of stuff. Most of it doesn't interest you until you spot a note about having recently found a large stash of bottled water. Suddenly concerned about the vixen's fate, you find yourself wondering if there's any way to rescue her, or at least learn from her where these supplies can be found.";

You don't recall these things being made this large. The exterior of the castle is sky blue, making it difficult to see at a distance.

You ask if there's any food, but she shakes her head and grins. 'Nope. I think I was out looking for some when I ran into those cute dolphin girls. Mmm...

You consciousness largely fades away under the constant treatment of the aphrodisiacs pumped into you as it sustains you with a sweet, nourishing liquid and air heavily laced with the mind-altering gasses.

Your children are born as inflatable versions of their sires. They are removed from your pod as they are pushed from your [if player is female]vagina[else]ass as latex eggs[end if] and released as more servants for the bouncy castle[if player is male].

Eventually though, one of the inflatable dolphin girls finds you. Having been lonely, you do your best to look inviting and comfy and yellow. Drawn in, she takes a seat in you. When you inflate a cock in your seat for her to ride, she's very happy and bounces around to ride it. Being sat in and being able to please (and pleasure) someone feels very good. She rides herself to several orgasms in you, leaving your seat pleasantly wet and sticky.";

Pleasure mostly comes in the form of dolphin girls who wander into the room to be sexually assaulted by your tendrils until you're both satiated. On other occasions, you send out tendrils to some of the other pillars and pleasure one another, forming phalli and orifices for them, spraying your latex cum onto and into each other. But sometimes, your greatest delight will come when some wanderer makes their way into your room. When this happens, you grapple them with tentacles of [ppcolor] goo, sexually pleasuring yourself and them as you draw them inexorably into you to be consumed and transformed into another punching pillar, as was done to you on that fateful day.";
