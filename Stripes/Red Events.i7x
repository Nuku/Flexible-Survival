Clearly this must have been a very sought after shop with great amounts of material, from a huge variety of sex toys and fantasy gear, to porn films and magazines. Except that now, it all seems to have been taken, and you now stand in the middle of furniture debris with little to nothing left.

It's coming from further deep inside, most likely the room where the other door leads, which is just behind the cash register counter. ";

You try to walk down through them as silently as possible, so that whovever is here doesn't hear you coming, holding yourself onto the wall by your left.

It's likely that numerous creatures or people came here to have their way with the toys they found, or have already been searching around. You can barely see or hear anything anymore, only shapes of what seems to be shelves, boxes and immobile human silhouettes, which are probably just lifeless mannequins.

He's wearing glasses, a blue button down t-shirt, khaki shorts, complete with red sneakers and is carrying a small backpack slung over his back, holding one of the straps in one hand to keep it there. Despite their small size, barely over four feet tall, you decide to be cautious and take cover to observe his actions for a moment, trying to decide what to do in the event you get discovered. He darts intently across the street, stopping in front of an alleyway where a tigress had apparently been waiting unnoticed by you until stepping out of the shadows. The orange and black striped tigress is much taller than him and wearing a skimpy outfit that shows off her shapely body. She has a pink half-shirt that barely holds her large breast line, but enough cleavage to show and compliment her assets. Beneath that, you can see a fishnet undershirt that covers her tight belly.";
	say "     Finally, a cheap, short, pink colored leather skirt that barely covers her generous ass and feminine slit completes the outfit, not quite hiding, yet still teasing and promoting. Her red hair is tied back into a ponytail by a small pink bow, with another similar pink bow at the end of her tail as if to lure others to try and sneak a peak at what she has under her skirt. The mouse stands there nervous to be out in the open while conversing with the tigress, shifting from one foot to another and glancing here and there for signs of enemies, while the tigress is seemingly at ease, almost as if bored by the lack of action and their current topic of discussion. Finally, she grows weary of the conversation she's probably had many times before and waves for him to show her the bag's contents. He smiles and pulls out a two-liter carton of milk and the tigress's eyes light up with barely contained excitement. She quickly grabs and rushes him into the alley, paws roaming over his body, now openly burning with deep need that she had been hiding under a façade of disinterest.";

The mouse's face seems to be the picture of pleasure as the tigress speeds up her pace, until her client groans, bucking his hips in orgasm, the tigress expertly drinking all his cream down. As gray-furred rodent comes down from his bliss, the tigress picks him up physically and sets him on his feet. With a casual movement, she then takes off her skirt and leans against a nearby wall, using two fingers to open her pussy in a not so subtle invite.";

He begins to go to town with all the force he can muster, his furry balls creating slapping noises as they swing against her in time with his rough and frantic pace. It doesn't take very long until the mouse's next climax due to both the pace and fatigue from his first orgasm, his breath running ragged and his thrusts grow shorter before much longer. He makes one final thrust, making sure to cum as deep inside as he possibly can. Tired from the exertion, the mouse sinks forward against her and actually passes out, apparently having spent all his energy in the frantic bit of mating. Not having gotten off herself yet, the tigress waits for a moment for him to continue, then glances over her shoulder and scowls at the sight of him nuzzling against her back with his eyes closed.";

She goes to pick up the milk from inside the mouse's bag and drinks some to wash down her creamy meal, glancing over to the slender male. One hand wandering down to her crotch and stroking over her sensitive folds, the large feline thinks for a moment, then picks up the unconscious mouse and his bag. The milk goes back in the bag, and that over her shoulder, while the mouse is carried in her arms as she struts down the alleyway, perhaps headed to her den in order to have round three. As the woman passes you, she winks and asks if you liked the show in passing, not really waiting for a reply.";
