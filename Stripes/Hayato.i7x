Section 1 - Event

Garage Demon is a situation.
The sarea of Garage Demon is "Capitol";
when play begins:
	add Garage Demon to badspots of guy;
	add Garage Demon to badspots of hellspawn;

Instead of resolving a Garage Demon:
	if hp of Hayato is 0:
		say "     While exploring through the devastated area, you come across an old garage that clearly had seen better days even before recent events.  Having only having one vehicle bay, the concrete building is quite small.  That bay is currently occupied, not by a car, but by a hulking red figure.  The muscled giant of a man sits cross-legged in the garage as if it were some kind of cave.  He looks like he'd be about 10 feet tall when standing and has a very powerful, muscled physique.  His face is quite demonic, with a pair of large horns pointing up, an exaggerated brow and chin, yellow eyes and large, protruding fangs.  He has a thick mane of blonde hair that flows down to his shoulders.  His skin is a bright red, covered only at his waist by a tiger-skin loincloth.  At his side is a massive club made of metal and covered in spikes that's nearly as tall as he is.";
		say "     Your first reaction to spotting him is to get away before he notices you, but you hesitate when you take note that there are a few boxes of supplies in the garage as well.  Looking back and forth between him and them, you ponder if your situation is desperate enough for supplies to risk approaching such a dangerous looking foe";
	otherwise if hp of Hayato <= 5:
		say "     Finding your way back to the old garage occupied by the large, muscled demon of a man, you ponder again approaching him.  Talking didn't seem to work out very well before, but you're unsure about attacking such an imposing creature as well";
	otherwise:
		say "ERROR-Hayato-[hp of Hayato]E: This event should be closed!";
		now Garage Demon is resolved;
		continue the action;
	say ".  Shall you risk approaching to [link]talk (1)[as]1[end link], [link]attack (2)[as]2[end link] while you have the element of surprise or [link]leave (3)[as]3[end link] before you are noticed?";
	now calcnumber is 0;
	while calcnumber < 1 or calcnumber > 3:
		say "Choice? (1-3)>[run paragraph on]";
		get a number;
		if calcnumber is 1:
			say "[haleventtalk];
		otherwise if calcnumber is 2:
			say "[haleventfight];
		otherwise if calcnumber is 3:
			say "     Deciding that it is not worth the risk of getting too close to his massive club, you slip away quietly.  You make a mental note to give the area around here plenty of clearance to avoid accidentally running into him.";
			now Garage Demon is resolved;

to say haleventtalk:
	say "     Approaching the imposing figure[if hp of Hayato > 0] again[end if], you try to intice him to conversation.  He gets up with a sigh before growling at you to go away as he reaches for his menacing club.  He glares at you with his yellow eyes.  You try your best to calm him down.";
	if hp of Hayato < 5:
		let bonus be ( the charisma of the player minus 10 ) divided by 2;
		increase bonus by hp of Hayato;
		let dice be a random number from 1 to 20;
		say "You roll 1d20([dice])+[bonus] -- [dice plus bonus] vs 14: ";
		if (dice + bonus) >= 14:
			now hp of Hayato is 6;
			say "     You continue being friendly, trying to reassure him that you only want to talk (despite whatever other motives you may have.)  Though unwilling to talk at first, you soon get him to relent.  'Fine.  If it'll make you go away.  It'd be for your own good; I don't want to hurt you,' he adds, sounding more cautionary than threatening.";
			say "[halhistory]";
			now Garage Demon is resolved;
		otherwise:
			say "     The muscled creature slams his metal-clad club against the ground, cracking the pavement.  'Shut up and leave.  Go away before I hurt you.  RArrr!' he growls at the end for good measure, shaking his arms menacingly in the air.  Something in his reaction makes you hope that it might all be for show, but he's certainly too worked up right now to talk to.  Perhaps you might try at another time.";
			increase hp of Hayato by 1;
	otherwise:
		now hp of Hayato is 6;
		say "     The horned man sighs as you approach again.  'Damn, you're persistent.  Very well, we may as well talk for a bit.  Just be careful around me; I don't want to hurt you,' he adds, sounding more cautionary than threatening.";
		say "[halhistory]";
		now Garage Demon is resolved;


to say haleventfight:
	say "     You charge forward, weapon drawn, moving in to attack the horned man.  Noticing you at the last moment, he gives a startled growl and stumbles to his feet while grabbing his club.  'Stay back or I'll crush you,' he growls, bashing his into the wall of the garage while attempting to ready it.  Pressing your advantage, you move in to strike while he's still trapped inside.  His mighty muscles raise the club again, this time putting it through the wall before swinging it wildly.  It goes wide and cracks into the other side of the garage door, but you're forced to step back.";
	say "     'I don't want to hurt you, but you leave me no choice' he growls, raising his club high enough to break a channel through the roof.  Rubble falls from the ceiling as he brings the iron club down, cracking the pavement in front of you with his strike.  Despite neither of you having struck a blow yet, your overconfidence causes you to only take a few steps back from the devastating swing before pressing forward again.";
	say "     When you continue the charge, the muscled demon does something unexpected and turns to face the back of the garage.  He bashes his club right through the back wall, knocking a large hole in it.  He then slams himself into the broken wall, the cracks running through it breaking entirely as your fearsome foe barrels right through it.  Having broken free of the garage, he just keeps running, fleeing rather than fighting you, much to your surprise.  You almost rush after him in pursuit before you realize the garage is coming down and move back.  The building collapses in a cloud of concrete dust.";
	attempttowait;
	say "     As you wait for the dust to clear, you think over what just happened, realizing that the demon's blows were all wide.  Either he had very poor aim or he wasn't trying to hit you, but instead just looking to scare you off.  Regardless, he certainly fled rather than fight you.  You ponder what just happened as you attempt to search the rubble for anything that might have survived, but it is difficult work and only yields a small pack of cookies which is intact.";
	increase carried of chips by 1;
	now Garage Demon is resolved;


to say halhistory:
	say "     The large figure gestures for you to have a seat on a couple of tires.  'I should perhaps introduce myself.  My name is Hayato, though you can call me Hal if you prefer.  As you can see, I am now an oni - a demon ogre,' he growls with a sigh.  He pauses for a bit in his introduction, passing you a small pack of cookies, which you [if hunger of player < 30]quietly munch on while he talks[otherwise]quickly scarf down[end if].  'I am to large to comfortably live in a home, so this' he gestures to the garage 'has become my cave.'";
	say "     'During that horrible night, it was chaos.  The dwindling survivors ran everywhere, trying in vain to get away from the monsters that seemed to only become more numerous.  Soot and smoke filled the air, burning the eyes and making it hard to spot the creatures before they were upon you.  My attempt to flee was cut off when an oni broke through the wall of a building.  It revelled in the destruction and began to attack and rape the people around it.  We tried to get away, but it caught up to us easily, swatting us to the ground with bone-breaking blows from its hand or club.  I fell to the street hard, head striking the slick pavement and all became blackness.  When I awoke, I found I had landed in a pool of the ogre's cum and had been transformed into a monster like it because of it.'";
	say "     He pauses again, looking down on his strong, meaty hands with their clawed nails and bright red skin.  He balls them up into fists before taking a deep breath and relaxing.  'I was thankfully overlooked by the monster.  I would not want my first to have been that horrible creature.  The others it had attacked were gone, their clothes torn to shreds and demon cum everywhere.  I realize now they have probably become more like it, but unable to contend with the dark urges and lusts which took them over.'  He shifts uncomfortably on the floor and presses a hand to his tiger-skin loincloth.";
	say "       Despite his fearsome face and gruff voice, there's a sadness to them as well.  As you grow used to his appearance and his voice, it becomes a little easier to read the true emotions beneath them.  'You should perhaps go now.  I thank you for the company; it is good to speak to someone again.  But now I need to meditate.'  You consider trying to talk to him longer, but decide to leave as he's requested.  Perhaps he'll be feeling more sociable later.";

to say disusedgaragedesc:
	say "     The old, single bay garage is build of cinder blocks and has seen better days.  While some of the damage is recent, it's clear that the place had fallen on hard times even before the outbreak.  Hayato's cleared out much of the space to make room for him in his makeshift living quarters.  Packed against the back wall are some cardboard boxes representing the oni's personal supplies.";

	otherwise:
		say "     Hayato (who also goes by Hal) is a hulking red oni roughly 10 feet tall.  He has a hefty, muscled build with only a tiger-skin loincloth tied with rope to hide cover himself.  At first glance, his face is quite demonic, with a pair of large horns poinging up, an exaggerated brow and chin, yellow eyes and large, protruding fangs.  Atop his head is a thick mane of blonde hair that flows down to his shoulders, matching nicely with his bright red skin.  His voice is rough and deep, fitting for his demon ogre form.  Having gotten to know him a little, you know this appearance to be external, with him a friendly, if somewhat sad, person beneath his terrible exterior.  Always nearby is a gigantic spiked club of iron that is nearly as tall as he is.";

		say "     The red oni gives you a fearsome smile that shows off his large fangs, but seems cheerful enough.  'Welcome back.  I hope you have been well.  Have a seat,' he says, gesturing to the tire seat.  'How about you tell me your story this time?' he suggests, sitting cross-legged in the garage while listening to you give a (mildly edited) account of your adventures in the city.  He is attentive and asks few questions of you, seeming pleased to just have some company again for a while.  He shifts and fidgets uncomfortably at the mention of some of the more sordid details, though you don't see any stirring in his loincloth even after a few baiting attempts to turn him on.";

		say "[one of]'My grandmother used to tell me tales of the fearsome oni.

'I have tried to get rid of it many times, but it is always there again when I awake.'[or]'Most everyone in this city is overrun with a mad lust.  Even I've had to... take steps... to keep myself under control.'[or]'I do not wish to become a monster like the rampaging oni I encountered.'[or]'I must contain my urges, lest I fully become a monster and harm others.'[or]'I am far too big to comfortably live in a house.
