Section 1 - Pediatrics Office

Pediatrics door is a door. "The city lies out of the huge hole in the roof and south wall, jagged edges making the going difficult, but passable.".
Pediatrics Lobby is a room. "You're in the lobby of a pediatrics clinic, surrounded by utter chaos. The formerly cushy seats have been ripped apart, their stuffing lying in heaps on the ground and even the wooden frames smashed to pieces. Claw-marks gouge the floor and walls. Patches of dried cum are almost everywhere, with even a steak of it on the ceiling. This makes moving around in here somewhat of an obstacle course, unless you want to step in something. A pair of metal doors to the deeper rooms of the clinic are still intact, battered but apparently resistant enough to ward off whatever creature or creatures did all this.".

Pediatrics door is dangerous.
North of Pediatrics door is pediatrics Lobby.
South of Pediatrics door is Wandering the City.

Doctors Office is a room. "A doctor's office, this one is a wreck. There are stains everywhere and food and water stockpiled in the cabinets. The clock is no longer running, and an oil lamp stands on the blue marble counter, on and burning. It fills the air with smoke. You idly wonder what happened to the smoke detectors.".

the scent of the Doctors Office is "The doctor's office smells of antiseptic and aroused lizard scents.".

the scent of Pediatrics Lobby is "With the numerous cum stains here, it hard to smell anything but that.".

I've already been quite thoroughly taken care of, I think,' a female voice responds. Clarifying that you are a survivor and that you meant if they needed any help in there, you can hear the clatter of a bundle of keys, then the click of the door being unlocked, allowing you entrance. 'Well, perhaps I can be of assistance to you, then,' the voice responds. The female voice does seem a little strange and you pick up the sound of clicking claws as she moves around inside, making you reconsider actually going in.";
