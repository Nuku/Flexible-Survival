to say losetohentaifan:
	say "     Having beaten you, the tentacled creature grabs you and pulls you fully into the room and pushes you down in front of the television.";

to say beatthehentaifan:
	say "     Your final blow leaves the tentacled creature stunned, swirls in his eyes.";

to say hentaifandesc:
	say "     The young man before you has become a strange, mutated creature, possibly because of his exposure to the contents of the anime being shown.  Like the girls, his proportions are a little cartoonishly skewed and his eyes are unusually large.  Similarly, his skin unnaturally smooth and even in tone, though a paler shade of pink than the girls.  Unlike them, this guy would have much difficulty passing himself off as human even at a glance thanks to the foursome of fleshy tentacles growing from his back.  Phallic-tipped and dripping with precum as they undulate, they move towards you with obvious intent, an intent echoed by the horny fellow's stiff 9 inch cock.";
	if bodyname of player is "Anime Babe":
		say "     The sight of those squirming tendrils as well as the sights and sounds of tentacular sex on the television is very distracting to your anime girl body.  You moan and squeal in barely suppressed pleasure as those tentacles draw nearer, your eyes drawn between them and the images on the screen.  A growing part of you longs for what you're seeing in the animation to be re-enacted right now.";
