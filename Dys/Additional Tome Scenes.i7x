It stands larger than a horse with jet black and yellow fur. Two curved horns poke out of the top of its skull, and it has a series of spikes along its back, almost like a dragon. It has three long tails, each of which appear to be burning with a yellow flame. Underneath its hulking form, you see a massive cock, an interesting mixture of both vulpine and draconic, featuring a tapered tip and a wide knot, as well as several protruding ridges along its underside.

Realizing your mistake, you try to back-pedal away, hoping to escape.

At first, you're just expecting them to be this monster's equivalent of cum. This hypothesis is proven incorrect, however, when the first bulge reaches your mouth. It forces its way into you, definitely more solid than you were expecting. It's at this moment that you realize that the bulges aren't cum at all! They're eggs!";

It's at this time that you feel the first egg pressing into your asshole, yawning the orifice open wider before it pushes in as well. The orb travels through your body before it comes to rest in your womb. As with the tendril in your mouth, this one keeps pumping eggs into you. Egg after egg gets pushed into you, and you can help but whimper in fear as you see your stomach bulging outwards, multiple distinct eggs visible through the stretched skin. Eventaully, you're completely stuffed full of the eggy cargo, and the tentacles withdraw from you.";

Each of the tendrils quiver before a fluid suddenly bursts from them. You can only guess it's the monster's cum, if the taste is anything to go by. You do your best to drink down all the fluids, and by the time the erruption of fluids has ended, your belly is distended almost comically.
