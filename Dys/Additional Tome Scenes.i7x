		say "     You open the thick tome and skim across a few pages. Surprisingly, you can actually make out a few words here and there, though they aren't near enough for you to actually [italic type]read[roman type] the thing. You tremble involuntarily before shutting the book, somewhat glad that you aren't able to read it.";

Nearly two hours later, you find that you've read more than half of the large books contents, and you suddenly blink, realizing how much time you've spent doing this.

Each of the tendrils is a sort of bluish-purple, and they all seem to be covered in some sort of clear slime. The adjacent page depicts a demonic looking feral fox. It stands larger than a horse with jet black and yellow fur. Two curved horns poke out of the top of its skull, and it has a series of spikes along its back, almost like a dragon. It has three long tails, each of which appear to be burning with a yellow flame. Underneath its hulking form, you see a massive cock, an interesting mixture of both vulpine and draconic, featuring a tapered tip and a wide knot, as well as several protruding ridges along its underside. The shaft itself fades from a dark metallic gold at the base to a bright yellow near the tip. It's leaking a stream of what almost looks like lava.";
