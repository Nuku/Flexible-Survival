The squeaks you were hearing are louder now, and there's a definite distressed sound to them that makes you feel almost bad for the stuck feral. Looking at the ground directly in front of the vent, you see what looks like a bike tire inner tube.

Not long after that, you feel your balls tighten and you let out a roar as you thrust in one last time before releasing your load into his ass.

You look for something to clean with before finding a towel that you use to wipe his butt. About a few minutes later you're finally done. You then order the male to forget what happened here and to go on his own way before uttering the end command phrase. When you do, the glazed eyes go away and he walks away from the two of you.

Soon enough, he's devoured them all, and grown in size as well. Your foxy compatriot now stands taller than a horse when at full size. Of course, he doesn't stay that large for long, quickly shrinking back down to a much more manageable size, hopping out of the truck bed. With his hunger sated, the two of you make your way back to his hide out.";
