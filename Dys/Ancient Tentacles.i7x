Turning to Xaedihr, who's standing nearby, you bring up the subject about wanting to summon them, and ask if there is some way to prevent the demonic tentacles from breeding you full of their eggs. 'There's a simple ward for that.' - he informs, leaning over to look at the tome's pages - 'If you want, I can cast it on you, and they will see you as an undesirable host. Can also reverse it to have the opposite effect. That is, if you're really keen on offering yourself to these things... I suppose I can see the fun in it... I mean, I share a similar power, just without the [']eggs['] part.' He gives you an unsubtle wink.";

You can't help but feel the arousal building up in you, from the anticipation, as you go over everything you need to do in order to summon it, each word and gesture indicated by the tome. As you're finished with the chant, it's only a matter of time until the arcane energy takes shape around you, and just a couple of meters away from where you're standing, a rather shy tendril emerges from the ground, exploring its surroundings by flicking around the floor. As it senses your presence, the tentacle directs its tip towards you, and soon, a few more appear, getting thicker as their length increase, already leaving a trail of a slimy blue liquid that covers them, as if excited to see you.";
	say "     Your heartbeat accelerates, and your own [cock of player] manhood hardens as you bite your lips, aware of what's going to happen once you're within the tentacles' reach. Curiously, they seem to approach you very slowly as you're not moving, only flickering as you put your hand forward to touch one of them that comes closer. Way less aggressively than the first time, they wrap gently around you, albeit firmly and denying you of any chance to escape. One slides around your back, roaming to your chest and placing itself around your neck as the ones lying by the ground wrap themselves around your legs, and some coming for your arms as well. You'd fall if it wasn't the robust slimy tendril holding your balance, and as more of them reach to touch your body, they lift you off the ground slightly as you begin getting enveloped in their lengthy extensions.";

At the same time, another tentacle finds itself slipping between your buttcheeks, pressing against your pucker and sliding in rather easily thanks to its slippery coating. As the thick tendril enters your ass, a moan is drew from your mouth, your lips opening just enough so the tentacle by your face could slide inside, rubbing itself against your tongue as your mouth remains wrapped around its length. You feel the juice's sweetness and its sticky texture holding against your taste buds as the tentacle wiggles deeper, towards your throat, and segregating more of its strange fluid, forcing you to swallow it. Its arousing effects slowly spread through your body in the form of a flushing heat.";
	say "     Desire overtakes you as, even if you had the will to struggle, you lose all inhibitions and give yourself into the care of the beast. As the tentacle in your mouth keeps pumping his drug-inducing liquid, the one in your ass keeps pushing, finding its way further inwards, so deep that you eventually lose track of its location inside you. When the tips are exactly where the monster needs them, the tendrils quiver before you can see several pulsing bulges coming through both of them. You already know what to expect once one of the prominences reach your mouth, nearly dislocating your jaw as you're forced to drop your chin even wider. They're the eggs of the creature, being pushed inside you, slowly and steadily.";

It's at this time that you feel the first egg pressing into your asshole, as you feel it stretching to accommodate the girth of the arriving flesh-covered orb. It then slowly travels through your body before it comes to rest in its destination. As with the tendril in your mouth, this one keeps pumping eggs into you. Egg after egg enters through your esophagus almost painfully, and you can't help but whimper in fear as you see your stomach bulging outwards, multiple distinct eggs visible through the stretched skin. Eventually, you're completely stuffed full of the eggy cargo, and the tentacles start to withdraw from you.";
	say "     With surprising care, you're smoothly delivered to the ground, unable to move, as the beast lets go of your body. You see the tentacles removing themselves from plain sight, retracting back into the ground.

With conjoined momentum, both the tentacles in your mouth and ass begin pushing themselves deeper into you, then pulling out rhythmically, literally fucking you in both your entrances with vigor. Each tendril wiggles and caresses your insides in such a way that makes you feel dazed with pleasure, and that only becomes more intense once another comes to wrap itself around your [cock of player] penis, which was already pulsing with each powerful wave of bliss you're getting with all the tentacle action. It squeezes your meat, and its tip circles around your cock's head, causing you to jerk your hips desperate for the sweet release that you feel coming closer.";

You don't want this to be over so soon, and your willingness is duly noted as the tentacle beast embraces your body even more, with every extension of itself brushing against all your sweet spots. It alternates how fast it's fucking you, from slow and steady movements to fast ones, until the creature is effectively edging you. With your orgasm so close to happen, you can't help but whimper and squirm around for the next few minutes. Finally, the tendril around your dick seems to be engulfing it, giving you the same sensation as someone was sucking on it, and that's when the creature decides to work on your climax.";

Your orgasm lasts for a while, but the creature doesn't let go of you just yet. Just when you start feeling each and every one of the tentacles thickening, the creature keeps them shoved as deep as possible inside you or around you, and suddenly, its tips begin splooging a thick, blue fluid all over and in you. It lasts so long that your belly has to extend in order to be able to hoard all the juice that's being pumped in you, and you can't help but whimper in fear of being blown up by the thing's massive load!";

You're then left lying down on the floor, weakened and abused, as your belly remains painfully filled with the beast's cum. You reflexively cough, and you're shocked to realize the creature filled you so much that you're also oozing the liquid from your nose!

Realizing your mistake, you try to backpedal away, hoping to escape.
