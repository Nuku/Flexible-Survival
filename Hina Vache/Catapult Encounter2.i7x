Looking around and deciding it is safe to check it out, you approach the medieval siege weapon. The design is proper but rather simple compared to what most illustrations had depicted of one, seeming to be made of spare parts and somewhat worn 2x4 boards the creator must have scavenged somewhere. But the biggest surprise has to be what is in the spoon of the contraption. A massive, industrial grade bag lies in wait, ready to be tossed far and high by whomever decides to fire the weapon. At first you think nothing of the bag, but your curiosity gets the better of you and you soon find yourself carefully opening the bag to see what is inside.";
	say "     [if level of Player > 4]To no surprise[else]Shockingly[end if], the bag is filled with gallons of seed, far too much to be from a single source. You quickly close the bag, careful to not get any of the nanite-infused baby batter on you. As you continue to inspect the machine, you notice ";

Gears spin and the catapult fires with a resounding noise of the firing arm thumping against the holding bar in the blink of an eye. Thankfully, you manage to avoid being hit by any moving part and just fall on your ass as you jump to safety. From your position on the ground, you see the bag sail high into the air, above the nearby buildings and further on after that, making you lose sight of it. You wince a little as a loud splash of the thing hitting the ground can be heard a few heartbeats later - no doubt having made an unholy mess of whatever was its designated target. Whatever it was - surely, now the place is painted a creamy white. Whelp, better get out of here before someone figures out what idiot fired this thing. So you take your trophy of a job poorly done and make a run for it!";

Almost immediately there is a commotion among the armed men, they start firing at it, big bullets ripping through the bag and releasing the mess inside.

They immediately begin to moan and sprout multiple infections after a couple seconds.";

There seems to be a large military blockade there, a huge earthen wall with turrets and barbed wire, giant tanks in lines behind that, and then armed men stretching as far as the eye can see.
