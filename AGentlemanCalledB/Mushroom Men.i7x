The small crowd erupts into cheers, shouts and sharp whistles as they begin stripping you of your gear, leaving your body on display for them. Soon there are dozens of tiny hands on your exposed body, stroking and teasing you[if breast size of player > 0 and a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds]. 'Mmm, they're even better face to face,' one of the mushroom men shouts as he nestles himself between your breasts, stroking one roughly while he pinches the other's nipple, causing you to moan[else if player is mushroombodied or player is mushroomskinned]. 'Just couldn't stay away, huh babe?' comments one of the mushroom men as he rubs against your mushroom form[end if].";
	say "     Eventually the mushroom men begin to congregate at your [if player is female]groin, several of them pulling your legs apart as a small group from the back of the crowd pushes forward[else]ass. One of the larger mushrooms gives it a firm smack, complimenting your [one of]firm[or]cute[or]sexy[or]hot[at random] bottom before waving a group from the back of the crowd over[end if]. Leading this group is a rather large-looking mushroom with a disturbingly phallic look to his cap and body. The two following him look relatively normal, but they are significantly larger than the rest of the group. [one of]'I'm gonna show you a good time babe,'[or]'I hope your ready for this toots,'[or]'I bet you can't wait for this hun,'[at random] says the cock-shaped shroom as he lines the tip of his cap up with your [if player is female]dripping cunt[else]clenched pucker[end if] before his two large companions lift him into the air by his legs, slowly pushing his cap into your body.";

	say "     You can't help but moan as the two large mushrooms begin working their phallic brother like a bizarre living dildo, driving him into your body over and over again while he teases your inner walls with his ungentle hands. As the fucking continues the rest of the group begins to drift to the rest of your body teasing any erogenous spots they can find as you fall deeper and deeper in your lust-filled haze. [if player is female]When one of the mushrooms finally begins pinching and tweaking your clit, it all becomes too much and you scream in ecstasy as you cum hard, soaking the two large mushrooms at your crotch in your feminine juices as your spasming tunnel clamps tightly around the fungal intruder, attempting to milk his soft body as if it were a real cock. You feel him squirming inside you, either trying to escape your tight grip or further pleasure you, drawing your orgasm out as each movement sends shivers of pleasure through you[else if player is male]As the fungal fucking builds to a rapid pace, you find your hands drawn to your unattended cock, stroking your erect length in time with the movement of the phallic mushroom. You groan loudly as you finally climax, blowing your load onto the ground beneath you as the mushrooms make a few final thrusts[end if].";
	say "     When the mushroom man is finally pulled from your body[if player is female] with a wet slurp and rush of fluids[end if], he takes a moment to shake himself off before giving each of his larger companions a high five. [one of]'Catch ya later, hun,'[or]'Can't wait to do this again, babe,'[or]'Let's do this again some time, honey,'[at random] your unusual lover shouts over his shoulder as he waves the rest of the group over, leading them back into the forest and leaving you in a well-fucked heap on the ground.[if player is mushroombodied] As you lay there, recovering, you feel a warm tingling welling up inside you as the mushroom man's fungal spores settle within, exciting your mushroom body.[impregchance][end if]";

Glancing around you try and locate the source of the call, spotting some movement in a large cluster of mushrooms at the base of a nearby tree. Slowly the pack of mushrooms pull themselves from the ground and turn to face you, giving you a clear view of the partially humanoid forms.";
	say "     The mushroom men come in significant variety, with several distinct shapes and colors, the most concerning among those being the group of strangely phallic-looking ones. While most of them are roughly a foot tall, there are a couple of larger fungi among them, peaking at nearly two feet. While lacking any visible gender, they all seem to carry a distinctly male presence. They begin shouting and cheering crudely as they move towards you.";

Several groups frequently make return trips to your glade, ensuring your sexual desires are always satisfied.

Before your eyes, he rapidly changes into curvy female mushroom with her arms and legs fused to her stalk-like body leaving her totally immobile. When the mushroom men finally finish and settle back into the soil, you gather up your ex boss and plant her safely in a large flowerbed at the back of the greenhouse. With the nursery's owner gone, the business soon falls into your hands and you lead it into a prosperous future with your most popular new product, decorative flower pots filled with a colorful variety of mushrooms.";
