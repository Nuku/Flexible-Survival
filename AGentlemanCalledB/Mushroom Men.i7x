[if cunts of player > 0]When one of the mushrooms finally begins pinching and tweaking your clit it all becomes too much and you scream in ecstasy as you cum hard, soaking the two large mushrooms at your crotch in your feminine juices as your spasming tunnel clamps tightly around the fungal intruder attempting to milk his soft body as if it were a real cock. You feel him squirming inside you, either trying to escape your tight grip or further pleasure you, drawing your orgasm out as each movement sends shivers of pleasure through you[otherwise if cocks of player > 0]As the fungal fucking builds to a rapid pace you find your hands drawn to your unattended cock, stroking your erect length in time with the movement of the phallic mushroom.

However with the exception of your missing limbs you still have a rather shapely body, and the wandering groups of mushroom men that happen upon you are more then happy to help you enjoy it, several groups frequently make return trips to your glade, ensuring your sexual desires are always satisfied.

When he bursts in on you as you tend to your private mushroom garden you turn just in time to see many of the mushrooms pull themselves out of the soil and tackle your boss to the ground.";
				say "     You find yourself equal parts horrified and aroused as you watch the mushroom men you spored violate him, coating him inside and out with their infectious spores. Before your eyes he rapidly changes into curvy female mushroom with her arms and legs fused to her stalk like body leaving her totally immobile. When the mushroom men finally finish and settle back into the soil you gather up your ex boss and plant her safely in a large flowerbed at the back of the greenhouse. With the nursery's owner gone the business soon falls into your hands and you lead it into a prosperous future with your most popular new product, decorative flower pots filled with a colorful variety of mushrooms.";
