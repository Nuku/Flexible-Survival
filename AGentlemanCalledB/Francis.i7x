While the boarded up windows prevent you from seeing inside, the large sign above the door makes it clear that this is the place. The weathered sign reads Bone-Appetit, and features a rather plump cartoon canine in a chef's uniform. Eager too follow through with your plan too free yourself from Rex, you reach for the door handle. Slowly pulling the door open a crack, you peer inside the building, noticing some movement and groaning near the back counter you pause for a moment before steeling yourself and swinging the door open.";

With the exception of the boarded up windows the exterior of the building appears relatively undamaged, thinking there may still be some useful supplies within you decide to step inside.";

As the canines move towards you there is a weak cry for help from their prisoner, a survivor?

The last thing you hear before slipping from consciousness is the his cry of ecstasy mingled with his captor's howl of pleasure.";

You turn towards the voice, seeing a figure step out of a nearby doorway, he appears to have the features of several species and breeds of domestic animals, a short stocky canine body and face, covered with a thick coat of fur in many different colours and patterns, there even appear to be feathers poking out from his pelt in several places. Finally, feline ears and tail complete the rather unusual appearance of the hybrid before you.";

I haven't a lot of supplies left, but I will gladly do what I can too help.' Without another word François gets too work, you can't help but grin as you remember the sign outside when he dons his apron and cap. Soon the entire bakery is filled with the warm scents of his work, and you find your mouth watering, despite knowing they are snacks intended for dogs.";
		say "   Eventually François finishes his work, and hands you a small paper bag filled with fresh treats. [if bodyname of player is listed in the infections of Caninelist or facename of player is listed in infections of Caninelist or hunger of player > 60] The enticing scent wafting from the bag in your hands proves too be too much, and you eagerly fish a treat out, François simple grins at you as he watches you enjoy a sample of his work. Still licking the last few crumbs of your snack from your lips,[end if] You stow the bag away in your pack and give François your regards before stepping back out into the city.";]

Finally, a rather feline set of ears and tail complete the appearance. He wears a surprisingly clean white apron over his torso, which does a reasonable job of protecting his decency, while still allowing his long tail to flit about unhindered.";
