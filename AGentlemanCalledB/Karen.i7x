It seems she was studying for a veterinary degree at the campus. 'I was going to be a vet... and now here I am, a dog,' she says, running a paw along the neatly stacked books. With a sigh she continues her search of the locker. While most of the locker's contents prove unhelpful, she does find a large book bag, which will hold significantly more than the small sack she's been carrying around, and a couple bottles of water which she shares with you. After picking out a few of the generalized-sounding textbooks and slipping them into her new bag along with the contents of her old bag, she peels the timetable off the locker door and pushes it shut. 'It looks like all my courses took place in one classroom,' she says, looking the timetable over. 'Maybe we could stop by there next?'";
