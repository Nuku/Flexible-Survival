Not surprisingly, she doesn't remember much. She tells you about the few fuzzy memories she has of her old self, most of the vague tales of her life as a student are unhelpful, but one story does catch your attention. She tells you about an unusual bakery on the outskirts of the high rise district she and Rex used to visit when he was the pet instead of her, a place the specialized in premium pet treats. Most of the story ends up revolving around how much she'd like to try one of those cookies now, but she does let slip that the old Rex was always ecstatic to visit and sample their wares. Perhaps this could provide the distraction you need?";

Recalling that FranÃ§ois seemed to remember her from before the outbreak, you suggest going to see him. Karen perks up a little at the suggestion 'Really? Do you think he would help?

You look back at her as her ears perk up, 'I know this place' she says, lifting her nose to the air and taking a few sniffs 'I can smell...me' Striding purposefully down the hall, Karen continues following her nose, pausing briefly at each locker she passes. Finally she stops, several meters down the hall in front of a still sealed locker. 'This one, it's this one. This was my locker' she says softly, taking hold of the small pink padlock. 'Can you help me get it open?'";
		say "     A short while later you finally manage to [if intelligence of player > strength of player]open the lock with a makeshift shim[otherwise]break the door off it's hinges with a liberal application of brute force[end if]. stepping aside, you let Karen open the door and peer inside, the locker is filled mostly with textbooks pertaining primarily to animal medicine, it seems she was studying for a veterinary degree at the campus. 'I was going to be a vet...and now here I am, a dog' she says, running a paw along the neatly stacked books. With a sigh she continues her search of the locker, While most of the locker's contents prove unhelpful she does find a large book bag, which will hold significantly more the the small sack she's been carrying around, and a couple bottles of water which she shares with you. After picking out a few of the generalized sounding textbooks and slipping them into her new bag along with the contents of her old bag, she peels the timetable off the locker door and pushes it shut. 'It looks like all my courses took place in one classroom' she says looking the timetable over, 'maybe we could stop by there next?'";
		say "     As you leave the row of locker and head back towards safer grounds you can't help but notice Karen's head held a little higher, and an ever-so slight spring in her step.";
