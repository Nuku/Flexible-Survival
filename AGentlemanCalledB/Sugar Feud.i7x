when play begins:

Instead of resolving a Sugar Shack:
	setmonster "Sugar Glider";
	choose row monster in Table of Random Critters;
	say "     Turning a corner you see a rather curious sight ahead down the midway, one of those brightly colored sugar glider girls scampering around a large stall at the end of the row. As you're considering turning back to avoid a confrontation with the excited marsupial, she spots you watching and calls out to you, waving you over eagerly. Finding yourself curious what she's up to you approach slowly, wary of some sort of trap the giggling girl may have set up, but you reach the stall without incident and find it to be, unsurprisingly, a candy stall.";
	say "     When you step up to the counter there's no sign of the glider who was here moments ago. Peering over the counter, you see the shelves of the stall have been picked clean, but there is a large cotton candy machine in the back that appears mostly undisturbed. 'Isn't it great!?' You whip around to find the source of the voice behind you, finding yourself face to face with the grinning sugar glider. 'And it still works!' she cheers, grabbing your arm and pulling you around to the door at the back of the stall, then inside.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As she flips on the machine, you hear the muffled sound of a generator stirring to life somewhere under the stall. The sugar glider bounces and cheers with glee as the cotton candy machine begins warming up. Soon the machine is heated and humming happily, simply awaiting the ingredients for its fluffy treat, which the sugar glider is all too happy to provide. 'Red or blue?' she asks you, fishing into her pouch and pulling out two handfuls of small sugary candies. 'Too slow!' she shouts before you even have a chance to open your mouth, dropping both handfuls of candy into the machine with a smile.";
	say "     She squeals with excitement as the machine begins spinning her contribution into sugary fluff, and when she can wait no longer, she simply reaches into the open drum, forgoing the sticks entirely as she collects a great spool of the stuff on her arm. Pulling out a sizable mass of the cottony fluff, the eager glider wastes no time digging in, burying her face in the cotton candy with a muffled 'Mmmm', filling her mouth with the stuff before waving her candy coated hand in your face, offering you a taste. You pull a small piece of the fluff off her arm and poke it into your mouth, savoring the powerful sweetness of the fresh cotton candy, and soon you're reaching for another piece. The two of you continue like this for some time, until her arm has been picked clean. After licking the last of the sweet fluff from between her fingers, the sugar glider gives you a cute smirk and offers you her paw. With the sugary taste of the last batch still on your lips, part of you wants to reach out and accept her paw, but a small part of you wonders if it's really a good idea. Will you take the sugar glider's offer?";
	if player consents:
		say "     'What's the worst that could happen?' you ask yourself as you take the glider's open paw and return her smirk. She cheers as she reaches back into the drum full of spinning cotton candy, pulling your own arm in with her. An itchy tingling sensation builds as the candy fluff collects on your arm, but you are soon distracted from that and the sugar glider wraps her long tail around you, pulling you in close and planting a quick kiss on your cheek.";
		if skinname of player is "Sugar Glider" and bodyname of the player is "Sugar Glider":
			say "     Moments later when the sugar glider pulls your hand back out of the cotton candy machine, you are delighted to find it covered in soft candy fluff and dig in with a cheer. Distracted by the delicious sugary treat, you hardly notice the sugar glider shifting to the other side of you, taking hold of you other arm and pulling it into the humming machine, this time all the way up to your shoulder.";
		else:
			say "     Moments later when the sugar glider pulls your hand back out of the cotton candy machine you are momentarily disappointed to find it lacking the large spool of sugar fluff you were expecting[run paragraph on]";
			if skinname of player is not "Sugar Glider":
				say ", but you discover it now matches the sugar glider's own paw exactly [if player is male]except that the thick coat of cotton candy fur that reaches up to your elbow is bright blue[else]with a thick coat of bright pink cotton candy fur reaching up to your elbow[end if][run paragraph on]";
			say ". Entranced by watching the [if player is not sugargliderskinned]thick fur[else]changes[end if] slowly creep up your arm, you hardly notice the sugar glider shifting to the other side of you, taking hold of you other arm and pulling it into the humming machine, this time all the way up to your shoulder.";
		say "     With your face so close to the sweet-smelling candy, your sugar clouded mind struggles to find a reason to resist her advances, and when you feel the sugar glider's free hand at the back of your head you can only giggle in anticipation. [if player is not sugargliderfaced]'You're going to be such a cute sugar glider,'[else]'This oughtta help you loosen up,'[end if] she whispers into your ear, placing another kiss on your cheek before plunging your head into the whirling candy filled drum. Fully focused on the cotton candy whirling around you, all you can do is open your mouth and try to catch all you can, giggling uncontrollably as the sugary fluff builds up on your face, ";
		if facename of player is not "Sugar Glider":
			say "pressing against your flesh and forming a thick [if player is male]blue[else]pink[end if] cotton candy hide on your shifting head. As the changes roll through you, ";
		say "the fluff seems to press right into your mind, further clouding your thoughts and pushing any lingering resistance out.";
		say "     You groan with disappointment as you are pulled from your cotton candy filled dream but soon find yourself face to face with your giggling lover once again. [if player is not sugargliderskinned]'You look lovely,' she says with a[else]She stares deep into your large eyes with a loving[end if] smile, before pressing her muzzle to your own in a deep kiss. Her long, agile tongue darts around your mouth with practiced mastery, easily outmaneuvering your own and filling your mouth with her deliciously sweet flavor. Meanwhile her dexterous paws are roaming across your body, quickly stripping you of your clothing and gear as she presses you up against the stall wall.";
		if player is neuter:
			say "     As the sugar glider's paws roam across your body, she gently brushes across your bare groin, massaging your tender flesh softly as waves of pleasure ripple through your pelvis.";

Her dexterous tongue slides along your eager cock, wrapping around it and teasing your balls before her muzzle descends down your length.

Pulling her muzzle from your shaft with a wet slurp, she kisses the tip of your [if player is not sugarglidercocked]now bright pink [end if]cock before smiling up at you and spreading herself out on the stall floor, teasing her syrupy drooling cunts with a pair of fingers as her long tail pulls you closer.";
			say "     You eagerly jump on your supine companion, quickly aligning your already excited shaft[smn] with her ready cunt[smn]. She squeals with delight as you press into her, her long tail wrapping tightly around your own as her paws grip at the thick cotton candy fur descending down your back. Your eager fucking quickly builds to a steady rhythm as sweet nectars spill out around your member, and soon the sugar glider cries out in delight beneath you, her spasming cunt[smn] gripping you tightly as orgasm rolls through her, pushing you to your own peak as you cum with a groan of ecstasy.";

Her long tongue makes one last slow pass over your [if player in not sugarglidercocked]now syrupy pink [end if]netherlips before she spreads herself out across the floor. The sugar glider smiles up at you coyly, stroking her own drooling cunts with a pair of fingers as her tail pulls you closer.";

As the sugar glider begins to lap at your drooling folds once again, you press your muzzle to one of her cunts, slowly working your [if player is sugargliderfaced]own[else]new[end if] nectar-hungry tongue across her honeyed flower, delighting in the sugary taste of her womanly fluids. As her practiced tongue works deeper and deeper into your trembling passage, you do your best to return the delightful feeling to your lover, pressing your tongue deep into her body as your muzzle grinds against her outer folds. Your cries of pleasure are muffled by the syrupy cunt your muzzle is buried in as your sugary lover rapidly pushes you towards climax, much like her own cries, as your trembling tongue drives the sugar glider to her own crashing orgasm, soaking your face in her sweet feminine juices.";
