Section 3 - Objects

Table of Game Objects (continued)
name	desc	weight	object
"ZPC"	"[zpcdesc]"	5	zpc

to say zpcdesc:
	say "     The Zephyr Personal Communicator is essentially a slightly oversized smartphone. It is a surprisingly sleek piece of technology that almost feels out of place considering the environment around you, no doubt a display of Zephyr's dominance and power. Flipping the device over, you notice that its white rubber back is lined with solar panels. It seems that you don't have to worry about charging the device. The onyx black front display is smooth and glossy save for the Zephyr company logo on the top. You see a small orange button on the side of the device. Perhaps you could try to [bold type]use the zpc[roman type]?";


zpc is a grab object. zpc is not temporary.

zpcturnon is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "turn on the zpc" as zpcturnon.

Carry out zpcturnon:
	try using the zpc;

Section 4 - Handling (Internal)

the usedesc of zpc is "[zpc_use]";

to say zpc_use:
	if emap is 0:
		zpc_checklocation; [runs location check function first to fill Zc value]
		if zpc_Zc is 0:
			project the figure of emap_special_signalnotfound_icon;
			say "     You turn on the device. It appears that your current location is not yet part of the Zephyr Satellite coverage region... Perhaps you could try the device in one of Zephyr's published compatible locations, such as the Smith Haven Mall?";
			now emap is 1;
			WaitLineBreak;
			follow the ngraphics_blank rule; [clear pic after WLB user response]
		else if zpc_Zc is 1:
			say "     The device will now track and display your current location, until you exit the satellite coverage region. If you wish to terminate tracking while still in the coverage region, simply switch the device off.";
			now emap is 1;
			WaitLineBreak;
			follow the zpc_lookoverride rule; [fill with respective pic]
	else if emap is 1:
		project the figure of emap_special_shutdown_icon; [off]
		say "     After holding the power button for a few seconds, the display fades out as an accompanying chime completes its shutdown.";
		now emap is 0;
		WaitLineBreak;
		follow the ngraphics_blank rule; [clear pic after WLB user response]


Section 4.1 - Internal functions

to zpc_checklocation: [returns Zc value of 1 or 0]
	now zpc_Zc is 0; [zeros returning value]
	repeat with n running from 1 to number of filled rows in table of Zpc Location Reference:
		choose row n in table of Zpc Location Reference;
		if location entry is location of player:
			now zpc_Zc is 1; [returns value (true/false)]

to zpc_getfigure: [returns Zf value of respective figure name]
	now zpc_Zf is figure of pixel; [zeros returning value]
	repeat with n running from 1 to number of filled rows in table of Zpc Location Reference:

			if zpc_inzone is false: [case if player not in zone yet]
				zpc_getfigure; [runs function to get Zf value (figure name)]
				project zpc_Zf; [projecting intro]
				now zpc_inzone is true;
			else: [case if player in zone]
				zpc_getfigure; [runs function to get Zf value (figure name)]
				project zpc_Zf;
		else if zpc_Zc is 0: [case for player exiting]
			if zpc_inzone is true: [case if player already in zone]
				project the figure of emap_special_signalnotfound_icon;
