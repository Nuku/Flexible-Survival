masslittering is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "dropall [owned grab object]" as masslittering.

To decide which action name is the action to be: (- action_to_be -).

Rule for printing a parser error while the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error and the action to be is the masslittering action:
        say "You don't see that in your backpack."

Carry out masslittering something(called x):
	if x is wielded or x is equipped:
		say "You're [if x is wielded]wielding[otherwise]wearing[end if] that.  Take it off first.";
		stop the action;
	otherwise if x is owned:
		let found be carried of x;
		repeat with z running from 1 to found:
			add printed name of x to invent of location of player;
		now carried of x is 0;
		if found is greater than 0:
			say "You set down [found] x [x].";

criminallittering is an action applying to nothing.

Understand "dropitall" as criminallittering.

Carry out criminallittering:
	let droptotal be 0;
	repeat with x running through owned grab objects:
		if x is journal or x is equipped or x is wielded:
			next;
		otherwise:
			let found be carried of x;
			repeat with z running from 1 to found:
				add printed name of x to invent of location of player;
			increase droptotal by carried of x;
			now carried of x is 0;
	if droptotal is 0:
		say "You don't have anything you're ready to drop.";
	otherwise:
		say "You drop everything but your journal and any equipped items you have.  You get rid of [droptotal] item(s) in all[if droptotal > 4].  Ahhh!  Your back feels much better now[end if].";
