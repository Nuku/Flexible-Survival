Freezing mid-step, you listen for a moment as your brain goes through the age-old fight or flight routine. Doesn't sound like there is a fight or anything, and worry that something bad may be happening to Sylvanus driving you to rush ahead, stumbling past other partygoers who're craning their necks to get a look at something in the grassy area of the backyard. Getting to the edge of the wooden deck, you can see that the source of the noise seems to be fraternity's goat mascot, writhing on the grass and letting out terrified shrieks that can do nothing to drown out the crunching sounds of breaking and reforming bones. The poor animal is completely freaked out by what's happening to him.";
	say "     At the same time, two similarly freaked-out college students rush to the fence and begin struggling to climb over it, away from the transforming goat and out of the otherwise empty pen. They're apparently too drunk to register the gate about ten feet away, and in their frightened flight scream something about 'things not going as expected' and 'it was just supposed to be a prank'. The scene is one of utter confusion and shock, as none of the people present seem to know what's really going on.";

Thankfully you're able to avoid getting hit, dodging to the side before kneeling down next to him. There, you lay a hand on his heaving chest, pressing down lightly to hold him steady and saying words to hopefully allow the transforming creature to calm down, explaining that things will be alright. From this close up, you can clearly see that this is no longer the innocent, small goat you saw earlier - Sylvanus is now a six and a half feet tall, anthro with clearly defined muscles all over, as well as a pair of, even larger than before, curling horns on his head. His wild-eyed gaze focuses on you, scared confusion only slowly letting go of his mind before he finally relaxes a little at last, as he recognizes you as someone he met before. 'Friend?' the anthro goat asks in a deep, scratchy voice, making use of it for the first time. Nodding and smiling, you pat his chest in a friendly way.";
			say "     The moment of calm is broken as Sylvanus then sits up, his eyes seeking out the two guys still struggling to make it out of his pen. 'Intruders! Bad!' the transformed goat bellows at the frightened students, then swings down an arm to crush a red plastic cup lying on the ground next to himself. He seems torn between getting up fully and charging after the two drunk guys, or interposing himself between you and them for a second, then decides to stay with you, stretching his strong arm to the side to cover you and shouting an enraged 'Baaah!' at them. The two intruders get pretty frantic, with one guy shouting to the other, 'Shit, shit - SHIT! He's coming for us! Gotta get out of here, Calvin!' Then he puts what effort he can into scaling the fence, actually making it over fairly well, only to fall flat on his face on the other side. The second guy, Calvin apparently, instead runs off to the side within the pen, trying to get some space between himself and Sylvanus.";

Turning your head, you see that it's Richard, flanked by several other PAN frat members. Quickly taking in the scene, Richard bursts out with, 'Shit, where did that thing come from?' Reacting to the situation inside of the pen, with yourself still kneeling next to the anthro goat and the other guy on the ground, he rushes forward in a haste. Yet as he gets closer, Richard exclaims, 'Wait, the thing has got a collar on? Is that... actually Sylvanus? What happened to him?!' Then he makes himself shake off the surprise, going on to point at yourself and the two drunk students as he says, 'Get a hold of those three! I'll deal with Sy!' Sprinting forward before he even finishes the sentence, the young man quickly lets himself into the fenced-off area and calling out to you, 'I need you to get out of the pen? I'll take care of this.'";

Meanwhile Richard adopts a non-threatening pose, and approaches the goat-man while talking in a calming voice, 'Ssshh, it's okay Sy. Everything will be alright, okay? You do still recognize me, right?' Turning his large form towards the approaching student, Sylvanus squints at him, inhuman eyes focusing on Richard's [if SatyrFratRichardRelationship > 3]satyr[else]human[end if] form. ";

			say "     Sadly, you're in exactly the wrong spot at the wrong time, as he glances the side of your hip with a hoof, sending you falling down to curl up with a breathless, pained whimper. Stars dance in front of your eyes and for what feels like long time, all you know is pain, until you vaguely register that the transformation of the goat seems to have concluded, as he has finally quieted down. Then the newly made goat-anthro sits up, looking over to you with wild eyes, then confusion as he recognizes you as someone he met before. 'Friend? Sorry for kick,' the anthro goat says in a deep, scratchy voice, making use of it the first time. You can do little but grunt, with him lightly patting your leg with a shame-faced expression. The moment of calm is broken as Sylvanus then sees the drunk guys from the corner of his eye, turning his head to look at them still struggling to make it out of his pen. 'Intruders! Bad!' the transformed goat shouting an enraged 'Baaah!' at the frightened students, then swings down an arm to crush a red plastic cup lying on the ground next to himself.";
			say "     As Sylvanus gets to his feet, at first on all fours only, he then finds out that his body doesn't quite work that way anymore. He struggles a little to find balance on only two legs after that, driving the two intruders frantic, with one guy shouting to the other, 'Shit, shit - SHIT! The freak's coming for us! He'll tear our heads off! Gotta get out of here, Calvin!' Then he puts what effort he can into scaling the fence, actually making it over fairly well, only to fall flat on his face on the other side. The second guy, Calvin apparently, instead runs off to the side within the pen, trying to get some space between himself and Sylvanus. Sadly for him, the towering goat-anthro appears to have sorted out his balance issues moment by moment, and soon is quite a bit more secure on his hooves than his drunken prey. Letting out an aggressive shout of 'Baaah!', the goat lowers his head and runs the college student down, just barely missing the guy as the student jumps aside in desperation.";

		say "As their eyes meet, a lot of the fear-driven aggression seems to leave the anthro, with him visibly calming down from the adrenalin burst. 'Big brother - but little?!' the goat suddenly bursts out, stepping forward and actually touching the top of Richard's head. Then he proceeds to wrap his arms around Richard and snatching him up off the ground in a tight squeeze. 'All strange. Bad!' he adds, glancing over to the two by-now apprehended drunk guys. 'And this one?' Richard asks, pointing to you, which Sylvanus responds to with just the word, 'Nice.'";

And if anything happens, give a shout, alright?! Hm, we might need to put him in one of the empty rooms upstairs later, I don't think he'd fit his bedding in the stable anymore.' At the same time, one of the drunk students starts to say something, only to fall silent as Richard gives him a pointed glare, hissing the words, 'Shut up Tomas, until I tell you to speak! You got no excuse, coming into our house and doing shit like... whatever this is!'";
		say "     With the dude falling silent, River approaches Sylvanus cautiously, worry about the large non-human plain on his face. 'Still in there, little buddy? Because you sure have grown, haha!' he says to cover his own nervousness, even as his gaze is inevitably drawn to the goat's crotch. He blushes as he realizes to himself that he's scoping out Sylvanus's junk, but seems visibly relieved that there's nothing at all sexual going on there right now. 'Water bro!' Sylvanus calls out happily, stepping up to River and putting his hands on his shoulders, then leaning over him, sniffing the blond man's hair. Chuckling, River asks, 'You can smell the chlorine, eh?' The last bit of tension between them vanishes instantly as he licks River's face and gives him a friendly squeeze. 'Okay, big boy. Let me bring you in, eh?' River says, tapping his large friend's arm. As Sylvanus is starting to be led away, you casually inspect him when he walks past you: Being a tall goat-man with jet-black skin and snow-white fur, he's got a lot of nicely visible muscles and two nipples on his firm pecs. Beneath the beltline, you can see a black sheath and large, furry balls dangling between his legs, a firm, muscular ass with a short up-turned tail on the small of his back.";

I don't think these two'd be telling the truth even if they weren't piss-ass drunk. And what's your involvement in this thing?' The last question was directed at you, which prompts you to reply that you only wanted to help and came in after things started. With a grunt and a nod, Richard bids his frat brothers to let go of you, then turns his attention to the crowd. The sounds of partygoers talking to one another swells as people look at each other, with some stepping forward or just calling out things. 'I saw them come from the kitchen, they just had drinks and pizza.' 'They climbed over the fence, those dumbasses! Right next to the gate too. I was wondering what they wanted to do in an empty pen.' An almost totally wasted guy half-hanging over the railing raises his head for a moment, then adds, 'They were messing around at the dog flap - err, goat flap. Luring the lil'biddy out with pizza. Then they fed'im their drinks and things wend bad!'";
		say "     As the truth is revealed bit by bit, Richard's face gets redder and redder, in rage. Soon, he turns on the two captives with thunderous fury, 'So you assholes tried to poison one of our brothers?! WHAT THE FUCK?' Trying not to flinch back from the enraged student, one of the drunk guys replies, 'Err... man, we... thought it'd be funny. And it was just... some wine and stuff...' Grinding his teeth, Richard opens his mouth to say something, then stops himself and shakes his head. 'No, of course idiots like you wouldn't realize that what's fine for humans can be deadly to animals. Even without all the strange shit going on right now.' Looking at his frat brothers, all equally pissed with the two interlopers as him, Richard clears his throat. 'Okay, enough of this. For being fucking idiots and running the danger of hurting Sy, the two of you are out of here! We don't wanna see you again, you're dead to the house! Guys, strip them down and dump them on the footpath out front! They can crawl back to whatever hole they came out of!'";

With a round, pink booty like that, I bet he'll have Spartans sniffing after him if he's not quick to get under cover.' 'Oh yeah, they'd totally want to play hide the sausage with him. Both of them really, haha!' Accompanied by jeers and laughter from the watching partygoers, Richard calls out, 'Better run if you wanna keep your boypussies safe! I think I saw some of those Greek hunks just around the corner over there!' Glancing the way he's pointing, you see that he's just wanting to put some fright into them, but the drunk guys are already off running without realizing this.";

As everyone looks over at him in surprise, the young man calls out, 'Gotta cut the party short for today, because those fuckwits messed with our mascot. We need to take care of him. So, everyone out!' There is some grumbling among the partygoers about the sudden end of their fun, but a number of others also ask if the cute goat is alright. No matter which, this doesn't stop the PAN frat members from clearing their house in a friendly but firm way. This does unfortunately include you, with Richard telling you, 'Thank you for wanting to step in and help. I think it'll be a day or three before we'll have another party.'

He almost falls right onto you in his drunken state, only barely catching himself with a quick grip of the fence's edge. His buddy is similarly disoriented and currently still standing on the other side of the fence. As he tries yet again to climb, you put your hand on his chest and tell him to come to the gate just about ten feet to the side. Staring at you in incomprehension at first, it takes a moment for the words to penetrate his mind. 'Ooh yeah, duh!' he grunts, then starts to slowly stumble the right way, all the while keeping his hands on the fence to brace himself. At the same time, the spasming body of the goat behind him falls quiet, then just lies where it is for a moment, not moving except for the rise and fall of a now much more humanoid torso.

The one guy still inside the pen becomes frantic, and would have started to climb again if you hadn't dragged him along to the gate, wrenching it open to let him through. Sylvanus arrives at the fence a mere moment after that, not leaving you any chance to close the gate as he lets out an aggressive shout of 'Baaah!'.

Before anything else can happen, a loud voice calls out, 'What the fuck is going on here?!' Turning your head, you see that it's Richard, flanked by several other PAN frat members. Quickly taking in the scene, Richard bursts out with, 'Shit, where did that thing come from?' Reacting to the situation inside of the pen, with a towering anthro goat right at the fence-line, standing within arm's reach of you, he rushes forward in a haste.

He blushes as he realizes to himself that he's scoping out Sylvanus's junk, but seems visibly relieved that there's nothing at all sexual going on there right now. 'Water bro!' Sylvanus calls out happily, stepping up to River and putting his hands on his shoulders, then leaning over him, sniffing the blond man's hair. Chuckling, River asks, 'You can smell the chlorine, eh?' The last bit of tension between them vanishes instantly as he licks River's face and gives him a friendly squeeze. 'Okay, big boy. Let me bring you in, eh?'

The sounds of partygoers talking to one another swells as people look at each other, with some stepping forward or just calling out things. 'I saw them come from the kitchen, they just had drinks and pizza.' 'They climbed over the fence, those dumbasses! Right next to the gate too. I was wondering what they wanted to do in an empty pen.' An almost totally wasted guy half-hanging over the railing raises his head for a moment, then adds, 'They were messing around at the dog flap - err, goat flap. Luring the lil'biddy out with pizza. Then they fed'im their drinks and things wend bad! Dudes wanted to climb, but this otter one shoved'em back in.'

Trying not to flinch back from the enraged student, one of the drunk guys replies, 'Err... man, we... thought it'd be funny. And it was just... some wine and stuff...' Grinding his teeth, Richard opens his mouth to say something, then stops himself and shakes his head. 'No, of course idiots like you wouldn't realize that what's fine for humans can be deadly to animals. Even without all the strange shit going on right now.' Looking at his frat brothers, all equally pissed with the two interlopers as him, Richard clears his throat. 'Okay, enough of this.

As the drunken dudes are struggling to climb over it, the spasming body of the goat behind them falls quiet, then just lies where it is for a moment, not moving except for the rise and fall of a now much more humanoid torso. Then Sylvanus pushes himself up from the grass, struggling at first to find balance on two legs for a six and a half feet tall, quite muscular body with a head bearing large, curling horns. 'Intruders! Bad!' the transformed goat bellows at the frightened students, stomping one hoof down on a red plastic cup lying on the ground next to himself, before starting a stumbling run towards the fence.

Whimpering in fear, he gets his feet under him and runs off to the side, trying to get some space between himself and Sylvanus. Sadly for him, the towering goat-anthro appears to have sorted out his balance issues moment by moment, and soon is quite a bit more secure on his hooves than his drunken prey. Letting out an aggressive shout of 'Baaah!', the goat lowers his head and runs the college student down, just barely missing the guy as the student jumps aside in desperation.

Sprinting forward before he even finishes the sentence, the young man quickly lets himself into the fenced-off area. Intentionally moving slowly and adopting a non-threatening pose, Richard approaches the towering goat-man while talking in a calming voice, 'Ssshh, it's okay Sy. Everything will be alright, okay? You do still recognize me, right?' Turning his large form towards the approaching student, Sylvanus squints at him, inhuman eyes focusing on Richard's [if SatyrFratRichardRelationship > 3]satyr[else]human[end if] form.

Barely able to speak as the muscled goat-man holds onto him, Richard strokes Sylvanus back and manages to get out, 'Relax, don't get yourself wound up again. We'll deal with them.'

Given his well-muscled physique, the anthro has no great difficulty in holding the position for a moment, then pushing himself back up. Holding out one four-fingered hand and tilting it left and right, he comments, 'Eating less pleasant now. So eh, some good, some bad.'

Meanwhile, the transformed mascot stands next to you patiently, tilting his horned head a little and smiling innocently. 'Want pet more?' he asks, half-reaching out to you, then thinking better of it and just presenting himself for you to touch. You can't help but chuckle a little as you run your fingers over the muscular form of the anthro, getting a good grope of his pecs and giving him a little pinch. This gets a surprised, but pleased reaction from the goat, as he seems to not be used to having sensitive nipples. Traveling even lower, you stray across the ridges of his abs and finally pause your hand just above his loincloth. 'Love tummy rub!' he happily tells you at that point. Looking into Sylvanus's eyes, you then tell him that you'd like to do a whole lot more than this, winking. He meets your gaze and his brows pull together a little as he thinks, then replies, 'Pet back? Both pet other?!' A happy smile at getting the idea spreads over his muzzle and he reaches out to pat the top of your head, then strokes down to your shoulders.";

Then soon, you try again, much less subtle this time and flat out tell Sylvanus that you want to have sex with him. He smiles and nods, then points at his muzzle and says, 'Not had sex before. Taste good?' Momentarily nonplussed by the goat licking his lips at the future treat he seems to imagine, you hastily explain that sex isn't something to eat, though you can do some of it with your mouth, and that it's really, really nice. Grasping at straws to get your meaning across, you tell him it's like breeding. That seems to strike a bell, and Sylvanus's grins broadly and adds, 'Ooh! Done breeding, was good. When Sylvanus still little goat. Brothers brought other goat!' Tilting his head again, he then asks you, sounding somewhat confused, 'Want mouth-breeding with Sylvanus?'

Reaching to the side of his loincloth, he says, 'Put mouth on-' You quickly shut him up by placing your hand over his muzzle, at which point he looks at you somewhat curiously, then playfully licks your palm. Trying not to draw any more attention than you already have, you quietly explain that breeding is something one does in private. Like in his room. With the door shut. And one doesn't call out about it loudly, or announce it to everyone. As you slowly draw your hand away, hoping he understood, the goat sticks his tongue out fully, whipping it up and down playfully a few times, before finding his focus again and saying, 'Many rules now. Different rules to before too. Brothers in stable when breeding before.'";

'Brothers said not slam,' he comments with a serious nod, then he pushes against the door until it is leaned-to, before giving it another more solid push, letting it fully snap closed. With a broad smile, the goat-man then looks to you, seemingly fishing for some praise. You smile and give him a thumbs-up, then let your gaze wander down to rest on his crotch. 'Private!' he tells you with a grin, then brings his hands to the side of the loincloth around his hips, undoing a knot to let the black fabric fall to the ground. 'Brothers said must wear something, unless private. We private now!' You have little doubt of why they made that rule, as you can see the head of his cock, slowly starting to emerge its sheath.

'Serve king mouth-breeding!' are the next words that come out of his mouth, with him waving a hand towards his crotch. You can't help but smirk at his cocksure request, commenting that he must have gotten up on the dominant side of bed today. Did he ever imagine that you might perhaps not want to be the submissive partner in this pairing? 'Sub-mi-sive?' the towering goat-man bleeks at you questioningly, apparently somewhat confused by the concept, so you explain the basics of human sub/dom relationships. 'Sylvanus big! Sylvanus dom!' he replies in response, clearly deciding that this is the way things should be.

For a second, you can't help but imagine some frat guys shooting the breeze with one another while on mascot duty, maybe boasting about their conquests. For sure they never thought that their goat was listening to every word, maybe not fully understanding what was said, but remembering it. Bringing his muzzle close to your shaft, he rubs it along the side, sniffing it a little, then sticks his tongue out just a bit, licking you.

As you tell him to get back to giving you more pleasure, he starts up again, lapping at your shaft. A moment later, the goat-man then proves that you must not have been far off with your earlier guess, as he then asks in a scratchy attempt at making a high-pitched voice, 'Oh yeah, like that papi?' Momentarily confused by your partner impersonating a c-tier porn actress, you wonder where he might have picked up the expression, and ask him about it. 'Angelo said. Angelo likes story-talk, always.' Chuckling, you then raise yourself on your elbows and stroke the top of Sylvanus's muzzle.

At first, he is unsure about how to react to the new sensation, and gives your finger a very light, just testing, chew to see how hard or soft it is. Hastily, you tell him that he should never touch any partner down below with his teeth, which makes the goat-man's ears droop in shame at doing something wrong, so you add that it's fine, and that this is why you're teaching him. As you stroke his head-fur a little, Sylvanus soon is back to his chipper self and starts using his tongue to play with you, running it along your finger. There is a need of a bit more instruction about closing his lips tight, but not too long after, you think he is ready for more.";
		say "     Withdrawing your digit, you wave your cock invitingly and bid him to go down on it. Sylvanus focuses his non-human eyes on your manhood, then sticks out his tongue and licks it again, before slowly lowering his muzzle down on the hard length. Your pleased groan at feeling his lips brush over your dickhead makes the anthro goat hesitate for a moment, looking up to meet your gaze. Somewhat impatiently, you tell him to suck your dick, and that he simply needs to do the same things as with your finger before. Finally, he opens up, with his warm breath washing over your rock-hard shaft, followed by that long muzzle sliding down over your erection. The sensation of your throbbing length sliding against his slick tongue is amazing, and even more so as he twists the flexible appendage around, half-wrapping it around your shaft at times and playing the tongue-tip over it.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Following your guidance to go further and further, Sylvanus's nose is soon brushing up against your crotch, with your whole cock inside of his muzzle. At this point, he tries to speak, which pretty much sounds like, 'Pfffrnnd gnnke?' You can't really make out what he wanted to say, but it doesn't matter much, as the vibration feels pretty great against your manhood, especially as he tries to keep talking some more afterwards. With a smile, you rub the base of his horns, telling him he's doing great, then explain to go up and down on you now. Haltingly at first, then soon growing in confidence of what he's supposed to do, Sylvanus starts giving you a blowjob, rocking his whole upper body up and down. He may just be a beginner, but the tongue-action that the hunky goat is giving you makes more than up for it, as he really knows how to use that part of his anatomy, feeling around and being pretty good at finding sensitive spots to tease.";

Sylvanus's slow servicing of your erection feels very nice, and you just lie back for a long while to let him work on your cock, but eventually your arousal grows too hot, too urgent to just be content with what you're getting from him. And that is when having a goat as a partner really pays off again, as those two large horns on his head make amazing hand-holds. Taking hold of Sylvanus's horns, you feel him tense up a little in reaction, with you defusing this by telling him just how good he's doing, and that you just want to guide him a bit. This gradually helps him relax his neck muscles again, and he mumbles some more unintelligible words, after which you begin to pull the anthro's head down against your crotch, then start to teach him somewhat more rapid movements of blowing someone, with you thrusting up your hips to meet his muzzle coming down.";

Thrusting again and again into the long muzzle and grinding your dick against Sylvanus's tongue, it doesn't take all that much longer before you erupt into his mouth, painting the anthro's throat and tongue with the creamy spurts of your seed. Sounds like he likes the taste too, as you hear a 'Mmmmhh!' from him, and he suckles on your dick, then swallows, several times. As he pulls away from your still-twitching cock, you take note of his breathing coming quicker and quicker. Nostrils flaring as his breath washes warmly over your skin, a glance past his horns tells you that the anthro is humping the side of the bed right now, with the tip of his cock sliding into view at every thrust.";

He looks at you wide-eyed as you guide one of his hands to his crotch, then tell him how to grab his own dick and stroke it. The four-fingered hand closing around his erection is not quite that of a normal human, but it is easy enough to adapt, and he seems to go a little crazy at the realization that he can pleasure himself like this, jumping into it with eager haste. Grunting and bleating, he grips his shaft tightly and humps against his own hand with hard thrusts of those powerful hips. The sensations of stroking are too much for Sylvanus to handle after just a few quick jerks, and he bleats out in overwhelming arousal. And with that, his balls start throbbing hard as they send forth cum to shoot upwards in an arc, raining down on your lower half and the bedsheets. Those furry balls of his sure are effective cum factories, as there seems to be almost no end for a little while, with more and more of the sticky white goop landing on you.";

'Friend smells like Sylvanus now,' the goat-man also states, sounding oddly proud of it, like it's an accomplishment. 'You like too?' he asks, looking hopeful at you and smiling broadly as you tell him you liked it, but that you're all sticky now. Blinking, then looking down at you, Sylvanus then begins to lick you clean, lapping away most of the cum. As he does this, you stroke his shoulders and head, petting him in a slow, comfortable way.";

For sure they never thought that their goat was listening to every word, maybe not fully understanding what was said, but remembering it. Bringing his muzzle close to your pussy, he rubs it along the nether lips, sniffing a little, then sticks his tongue out just a bit, licking you.

He keeps looking at you even after that, just waiting and smiling. Reaching down to spread your folds open with two fingers, then dipping in one digit to slide in and out of your opening, you wave the moist finger before Sylvanus's nose, then point him right to your crotch. As you tell him to get back to giving you more pleasure, he starts up again, lapping at your slit. A moment later, the goat-man then proves that you must not have been far off with your earlier guess, as he then asks in an intentionally gruff voice, 'Like that, babycakes?' Momentarily confused by your partner spouting a corny line like that, like from a 70's porn flick.

He looks a little disappointed momentarily, but then listens to you intently as you instruct him on how to service your feminine parts. His brows draw together in thought as you point out the multiple different pleasure spots, inside and outside of your body, as well as how to please them. While he doing his best to commit the things you're telling him to memory, you can't help but feel that this might be going a bit above his head right now, so you soon move on to a bit more of a 'hands-on' technique, rubbing the base of his horns and then telling the anthro in a gentle voice to try things, and you'll guide him along.

He also begins exploring a little with the tip of his tongue, soon dipping it into the opening of your vagina and seemingly being surprised that it keeps going, so he presses his muzzle forward to allow his tongue even deeper. The adventurous appendage worms its way into your pussy, twisting this way and that, and then... bumps right against your g-spot, which sends a spasm through your body, accompanied by a lewd mewl slipping past your lips. Momentarily frightened by that reaction, the goat-man raises his head, looking at you questioningly. 'Lick not good? Or good?' he asks with an innocent expression.

As flick after flick of the appendage pushes your internal pleasure-button, you lie back on the mattress and pant out loud, being in the grip of rising arousal. At one point, as you let out an especially urgent sound of pleasure, Sylvanus tries to speak while still having his tongue inside you, which pretty much sounds like, 'Pfffrnnd gnnke?' You can't really make out what he wanted to say, but it doesn't matter much, as the vibration feels amazing, especially as he tries to keep talking some more afterwards!

With a friendly smile on your face, you tell him to try sucking your clit now - gently - and to flick his tongue over it, up and down in a steady rhythm. And while doing so, he can dip a finger into your pussy, so it doesn't feel so empty after all his amazing tongue-play. Happy enough to try right away, he slides his lips over the little nub of your clit and starts to give it special attention, which makes your arousal grows by leaps and bounds.

Letting go of his head, you allow him to straighten his upper body and explain that he'll have an easier time just using his hand. He looks at you wide-eyed as you guide one of his hands to his crotch, then tell him how to grab his own dick and stroke it. The four-fingered hand closing around his erection is not quite that of a normal human, but it is easy enough to adapt, and he seems to go a little crazy at the realization that he can pleasure himself like this, jumping into it with eager haste.";

And with that, his balls start throbbing hard as they send forth cum to shoot upwards in an arc, raining down on your lower half and the bedsheets. Those furry balls of his sure are effective cum factories, as there seems to be almost no end for a little while, with more and more of the sticky white goop landing on you. Sylvanus seems fascinated with the look of cum having splattered all over your form, and he leans his head down to look at it closely, sniffing it, then licking experimentally.

Was kinda close to storming in here and shut things down, but then I realized I wouldn't be doing that for any other brother. I mean, you were both into it from the sounds of it, weren't you?' Standing up in all his naked glory, Sylvanus turns around to River, smiling as he replies, 'Was really good mouth-breeding! Me like!' River's eyes go wide as the anthro does that, with him quickly raising a hand in front of his eyes. 'Sy, we talked about showing your crotch to people, remember?' You decide to help out in the moment by getting up yourself, then draping the bedsheet around the goat's hips. Peeking through his fingers, then lowering the arm, River shakes his head, but with a smile on his face. 'I guess you're not just our little goat anymore, are you Sylvanus? More like the real brother we always knew you were.'";
	say "     In a happy tone, Sylvanus replies, 'Love mouth-breeding fun. River wanna do too?' As the goat-man waves a hand towards his friend's face, then points down to his crotch, River blushes bright red in the face, momentarily speechless. He takes a second to catch himself, swallowing nervously before putting on a smile and shaking his head. 'Thanks. Er, I'm good, buddy.' Then he gives the large anthro a little bit of a more serious look and adds, 'You know, sex is something you'll want to be a little bit more selective with. You don't have to do it with everyone, you know. Things are a lot nicer, if you only do stuff with people you like.' Stepping forward, one hand on the bedsheet around his hips, the goat replies, 'But Sylvanus really like River!' Reaching out to pat the transformed mascot's upper arm, River gives him a little bit of a strained nod and explains, 'I like you too, Sy. But we don't start things with everyone we like either. Sometimes people are just friends... anyways, I'll leave the two of you to sort yourselves out. Just wanted to check in anyways.' With that, River quietly slips out of the room again, though he pauses for a second to look back before closing the door.";
