Body Shop	"Body Shop"

Body Shop is a room.
Body Shop is southeast of Mall East Wing.
The description of Body Shop is "[BodyShopDesc]".

to say BodyShopDesc:
	say "     This room seems to have been a clothing boutique before the chaos started - at least judging by the wide-open floorspace, the row of changing booths in the back and numerous mannequins standing around motionlessly. Interestingly, none of the dolls actually wears a shred of clothing, with all of the former merchandise and the stands they were offered on pushed into an untidy heap in one corner of the store. No, what is being presented now instead are the mannequins themselves... on a second look, you see that they often vary from the 'typical' stature of sexless store mannequins. A row of them at the shop windows sports impressive erections - equine, canine, feline and human, to name just a few, while other little groups have a variety of facial features and body plans. Further in the back are several that one might believe customers at first - fully formed anthros with life-like skin, feathers or otherwise - if they didn't stand quite so motionless and still...";

Moreau	"Moreau"

Moreau is a man.
The description of Moreau is "[MoreauDesc]".
The icon of Moreau is Figure of Moreau_soft_icon.
The conversation of Moreau is { "Pay up!" }.
Moreau is in Body Shop.

the scent of Moreau is "Moreau has a hot, spicy scent that reminds you of exotic places.".

To say MoreauDesc:
	if debugactive is 1:
		say "DEBUG -> HP of Moreau: [HP of Moreau], libido of Moreau: [libido of Moreau] <- DEBUG[line break]";
	say "     Moreau is a snake... quite literally so, as most of his body is purely ophidian, going on and on as it slowly tapers. But in addition to that, he does have a waist too - you can see the typical little bulges where the hip-bone are right under the skin, and above that a human-like torso, giving him arms and opposable thumbs. A quick glance down to his crotch reveals that it is smooth and relatively bare, with just a narrow slit between the rows of scales - no telling what might or might not be hidden inside that. The naga bears a truly awe-inspiring set of scales, with vibrant shades of red, orange and yellow making him almost appear like a dragon, complete with a little crest of scale-tips standing up on his broad snake-head.";
	say "     In a sharp contrast to his fiery-colored body, the storekeeper's large eyes are startlingly green, making you freeze where you stand as he notices your attention and focuses his gaze on you in turn. The emerald, slit-pupiled orbs seem like bottomless pools you could stare at forever and lose yourself in... and you almost do, before he turns his head and breaks the stare. Opening his mouth a fraction, the naga tastes the air with his split tongue and then smiles at you, waving you closer with an inviting gesture.";

Instead of conversing the Moreau:
	project the figure of Moreau_face_icon;
	if HP of Moreau is 0:
		say "     'Welcome to my store,' the naga tells you with a gracious bow, snaking his way closer to you before coiling up right in front of where you stand. 'Did something in the shop windows catch your eye? The offered wares are subject to change, and I do circle through the newer parts for people to have a look at.' You look around at the collection of mannequins, then ask what he actually sells. 'Why, bodies of course. Everything about them. The signage is quite clear, is it not? Come, let me show you.' Miming you to walk over to the next bunch of mannequins, the ophidian storekeeper keeps up with your steps in a smooth glide of his scales on the tiled floor, stopping before the display models.";
		say "     'We live in times of change - that is obvious - but many, oh so very many of people are dissatisfied with their adopted shapes. Maybe they were forced to shift, or couldn't help but succumb into it, and now they feel like they deserve... better. I offer this service, for a price.' Smiling at you, he then turns to stare directly at a mannequin shaped like an anthro gryphon, its body detailing everything exactly, from the tips of the clawed digitigrade feet, up over a hermaphrodite's set of cock, balls and pussy to the pair of wings behind its back. Only the showpiece's head is still that of an almost featureless doll, as well as the skin which has a white plastic-y sheen.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Giving you a sidelong glance that tells you he loves showing off, Moreau crooks his finger a little at the mannequin - and the human-sized doll instantly reacts, walking over to come stand before you with startling suddenness. As it comes to stand in front of you in an 'at rest' position, you can't help but gulp and glance around. Ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-six, -seven, -eight... there are about thirty of those things in here, which makes you feel less like on a shopping trip and more like standing in the midst of a pride of lions. 'Do not be concerned, my assistants are perfectly well behaved. Watch this one for example,' Moreau says, amusement underlying his voice as he puts the gryphon doll through its paces, spinning around slowly, stretching and showing off the details of its shape.";
		say "     Once he is satisfied with the mannequin, Moreau sends it back to the original position and turns back to you. 'I can offer the service of giving people what they want. And even more than that - I give a warranty. No more losing what you so dearly desired, you understand,' the snake tells you in a quite smooth-talking voice, guiding you in a tour through the store, past numerous of the motionless living dolls. While you walk, your gaze falls upon a treasure-trove of supplies stacked up in the back. He must have weeks forth of food and water there! Curiosity drives you to check it out from up close, but after a few steps, the naga's hand slides under your and gently but firmly tugs you back to his tour. Then you notice that every last one of the mannequins in the whole store turned their head towards you when you came close to the supplies. They quickly take their positions again, but you can't help but shiver a little from so many featureless faces staring at you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Finally arriving back where you started after having shown off all sorts of creature parts you never even knew existed, Moreau smiles and shows his forked tongue for a second. 'As you can see, I do have much to offer. It depends a bit on what people sell to me, so be sure to get anything you desire immediately, so it is not sold out by the time you return. You will find the prices very reasonable for this unique service...'";

They are quite interesting, are they not? When this all started, seeing all the changes happening around this city had started to give me some vague ideas along the lines of this shop, but it wasn't until I stumbled on a discarded mannequin on the side of the road that those ideas really clicked together. And so I came here, as I knew there'd be plenty of mannequins to work with, and with a bit of my own magical talent was able to convert the mannequins you see here from their inert state to something more suitable for my purposes. The process took some refining, but I think the result has been well worth it all.'";

	say "     With your confrontational posture and the skeptical look on your face, the shopkeeper seems to recognize that you've seen the roaming mannequins and he lets out a sigh, gesturing you to follow him toward the back of the store before answering in a hushed voice. 'I can tell what you're really asking, and thinking. And no, I did not lie to you before, I simply left some of the finer details out as I always do when people ask me about them. I do not wish to frighten away my customers after all.' He gives you a smile at that, which was probably meant to be reassuring, but ends up a little more sinister. You nod to him, gesturing for him to continue talking.";
	say "     After a quick glance around the store to make sure no one is approaching, he continues. 'As you probably guessed, the mannequin I found was one of the animate ones this event has created. I fought and defeated it, and nearly left it there, until the idea of this shop occurred to me. This form has given me certain... powers of persuasion, which I used to bring the mannequin under my control. Having seen what they do to those they defeat, and not wishing to have to fight and collect them one by one, I had the idea to transform an ordinary mannequin. I tested the idea on an inert mannequin from a nearby store, and finding that it had worked, led my two new mannequins here to collect more from the abandoned stores. So yes, one of my mannequins is from out in the city. Perhaps it was once a person, but there was no way for me or anyone else to tell. The rest were all created from inert mannequins. I've harmed no one, and they're all completely under my control. Does that satisfy you?'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Considering what else has been happening in this warped city and how this seems to be one of the more benign and overall harmless, if still unsettling, things you've seen, you nod to him with a sigh. He nods with a smile, visibly relaxing as his tongue flicks out at the air. 'Good. Now that your curiosity is satisfied, perhaps you'd like to look around the shop and see if anything catches your eye?' Telling him that you will, you step away, returning to looking around the store.";

to say MoreauTalk3: [ask if buying is worth it if you just keep changing]
	say "     Moreau gives you a winning smile as you ask your question, snaking his way to a nearby mannequin and pointing out its physical features. 'Ah, I can assure you that anything you might want to pick will be quite worth the investment. Not only are the physical characteristics that I offer very specific in their nature, rather than the random chance you might have out on the streets, but I can also offer a bit of permanence for them. There are some little tricks in my repertoire that will help ensure it.' The naga's forked tongue flicks out of his mouth as he focuses on you intensely, eager to make a deal. 'Of course, if you should wish to change again afterwards, I can also take off the 'body part guarantee' again. Just return and sell the part back to me and you will be as changeable as before.'";

Body Choice Dilemma is a situation.
The sarea of Body Choice Dilemma is "Nowhere".

after going to Body Shop while (Body Choice Dilemma is active and Body Choice Dilemma is not resolved and lastBodyShopEvent - turns > 1 and HP of Moreau > 0 and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds):
	BodyChoiceDilemmaEvent;

to BodyChoiceDilemmaEvent:
	say "     As you enter Moreau's shop, you are surprised not to be immediately greeted by its serpentine owner. The reason becomes clear after you notice him further in the Body Shop, standing next to a buff, tall, seemingly very pensive horseman. Said horseman is gazing in the direction of two mannequins. The first one is displaying anthro snow leopard parts; not just a crotch or tail, but an entire body, complete with fur, a feline face, and an overall feminine look, although the furry sheath between the mannequin's legs marks this body as male. Next to it is a second mannequin, this one unmistakably female for it has the body parts of a succubus. As you glance over a scene you would qualify as implausible were it not taking place in this strange shop, Moreau finally notices you: 'Welcome, [if player is not defaultnamed][name of player][else]my friend[end if]. I apologize for not greeting you right away, but as you can see I am currently tending to the needs of another customer. Actually...' he adds with a thoughtful look, 'If I was bold enough, I would ask you a little help tending to those needs. Hmm...'";
	say "     The naga leaves his words hang in the air, closing his eyes as if he was deeply pondering the question; although your instincts tell you this is at best a facade, and at worst a shameless attempt at manipulation, the uncomfortable silence that follows eventually drives you to ask how you can help him. With an apologetic smile, Moreau explains: 'Well, as most beings who come here, my current client has a desire of change. Although he had a very clear idea what kind of body he wanted for himself, coming down on the specifics has been... complex. I would like you to help the poor man make up his mind. I feel the need to mention that I would be... somewhat discontent to see him leave without making a purchase.' The naga discreetly points at a rather large pile of canned food, no doubt the price one would have to pay for a full new body.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As the shop owner seems intent on letting you learn more from the source, you walk to the large black horse whose gaze just goes on one mannequin and then on the other as he taps a finger against his chin. When you introduce yourself, the stud's low, manly voices betrays his anxiety: 'Oh sorry man, am I holding the alligator guy all to myself?' As you notice the look of surprise and indignation on Moreau's face at being called such a thing, you assure his horse client that it is no problem at all, but that you'd love to know if you could help with whatever decision the equine has to make. 'Oh thanks, that's really nice! See, before the infection-the name's Jaime, by the way-, before the infection I was already super buff and a really big dude, in more ways than one.

Like, I LOVE being a top, but them, they look like they're in trance. Anyway, long story short, curiosity became envy, and eventually I started imagining I was the people I was fucking.

Although a more clear-headed person could have found the situation disturbing or even worrying, the mouse seems to share the general opinion that it is instead utterly amusing, and as you cannot for the life of you guess what is about to take place, you are surprised to see the mouse cover his eyes with one paw and point in front of him with other. Then, the group start chanting 'Spin! Spin! Spin!', and the mouse does start spinning, rotating as fast as possible while blind and barely managing not to fall flat on his face in the process.";

After a little while, their friend comes back, greeted by deafening cheers and clapping; or at least, you assume it's their friend. The former mouse now display a completely mismatched new body, with a wolf head, eagle body shape, pig skin, satyr tail and ass, and the pussy of a mare. The whole thing, frankly, does not come out to you as very pleasing to the eye, but the drunk party members appear not to share your opinion as they keep on cheering and chanting.";

Having no choice but to wait, you patiently witness two more people play this little game and end up with strange mismatched infections, before the group eventually decides it had enough and noisily leaves the shop, leaving behind empty beer cans and not even bothering to thank or say goodbye to the naga.

And I can't scavenge for more supplies, I don't know how to fight! I'm gonna end up eaten by a wyvern, or something even more horrible!' Feeling bad for her, you try to convince the shop owner that he can't let a defenseless woman risk her life just to get him more supplies.

Maybe... I can tell them about your shop, and how cool it is to choose whatever parts you want? I used to be a renowned fashion critic, before this whole thing. A lot of them knew me by reputation before they even met me after the infection. I came here on my own, but if people were to have an interest in this shop, they might be able to secure a root. People where I come from have a massive amount of supplies, they can pay for anything!'";

Before she can protest, he adds: 'Not yet, at least. But if you do what you promise and bring new clients from the High Rise District to my shop, then I will consider your part of the deal complete and make this last little change you desire.' The hyena doesn't seem to pleased. 'My husband won't like that... He's not really into penises.' The naga smirks and gives a little snort.
