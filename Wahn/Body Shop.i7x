Section 1 - Rooms

[Room Declaration]
Southeast of Mall East Wing is Body Shop.
The description of Body Shop is "[BodyShopDesc]".

to say BodyShopDesc:
	say "     This room seems to have been a clothing boutique before the chaos started - at least judging by the wide-open floorspace, the row of changing booths in the back and numerous mannequins standing around motionlessly. Interestingly, none of the dolls actually wears a shred of clothing, with all of the former merchandise and the stands they were offered on pushed into an untidy heap in one corner of the store. No, what is being presented now instead are the mannequins themselves... on a second look, you see that they often vary from the 'typical' stature of sexless store mannequins. A row of them at the shop windows sports impressive erections - equine, canine, feline and human, to name just a few, while other little groups have a variety of facial features and body plans. Further in the back are several that one might believe customers at first - fully formed anthros with life-like skin, feathers or otherwise - if they didn't stand quite so motionless and still...";

Section 2 - NPC

Moreau is a man.
The description of Moreau is "[MoreauDesc]".
The conversation of Moreau is { "Pay up!" }.
Moreau is in Body Shop.

the scent of Moreau is "Moreau has a hot, spicy scent that reminds you of exotic places.".

	say "     Moreau is a snake... quite literally so, as most of his body is purely ophidian, going on and on as it slowly tapers. But in addition to that, he does have a waist too - you can see the typical little bulges where the hip-bone are right under the skin, and above that a human-like torso, giving him arms and opposable thumbs. A quick glance down to his crotch reveals that it is smooth and relatively bare, with just a narrow slit between the rows of scales - no telling what might or might not be hidden inside that. The naga bears a truly awe-inspiring set of scales, with vibrant shades of red, orange and yellow making him almost appear like a dragon, complete with a little crest of scale-tips standing up on his broad snake-head.";
	say "     In a sharp contrast to his fiery-colored body, the storekeeper's large eyes are startingly green, making you freeze where you stand as he notices your attention and focuses his gaze on you in turn. The emerald, slit-pupiled orbs seem like bottomless pools you could stare at forever and lose yourself in... and you almost do, before he turns his head and breaks the stare. Opening his mouth a fraction, the naga tastes the air with his split tongue and then smiles at you, waving you closer with an inviting gesture.";

Instead of conversing the Moreau:
	if hp of Moreau is 0:
		say "     'Welcome to my store,' the naga tells you with a gracious bow, snaking his way closer to you before coiling up right in front of where you stand. 'Did something in the shop windows catch your eye? The offered wares are subject to change, and I do circle through the newer parts for people to have a look at.' You look around at the collection of mannequins, then ask what he actually sells. 'Why, bodies of course. Everything about them. The signage is quite clear, is it not? Come, let me show you.' Miming you to walk over to the next bunch of mannequins, the ophidian storekeeper keeps up with your steps in a smooth glide of his scales on the tiled floor, stopping before the display models.";
		say "     'We live in times of change - that is obvious - but many, oh so very many of people are dissatisfied with their adopted shapes. Maybe they were forced to shift, or couldn't help but succumb into it, and now they feel like they deserve... better. I offer this service, for a price.' Smiling at you, he then turns to stare directly at a mannequin shaped like an anthro gryphon, its body detailing everything exactly, from the tips of the clawed digitigrade feet, up over a hermaphrodite's set of cock, balls and pussy to the pair of wings behind its back. Only the showpiece's head is still that of an almost featureless doll, as well as the skin which has a white plastic-y sheen.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Giving you a sidelong glance that tells you he loves showing off, Moreau crooks his finger a little at the mannequin - and the human-sized doll instantly reacts, walking over to come stand before you with startling suddenness. As it comes to stand in front of you in an 'at rest' position, you can't help but gulp and glance around. Ten, fifteen, twenty, twentysix, -seven, -eight... there are about thirty of those things in here, which makes you feel less like on a shopping trip and more like standing in the midst of a pride of lions. 'Do not be concerned, my assistants are perfectly well behaved. Watch this one for example,' Moreau says, amusement underlying his voice as he puts the gryphon doll through its paces, spinning around slowly, stretching and showing off the details of its shape.";
		say "     Once he is satisfied with the mannequin, Moreau sends it back to the original position and turns back to you. 'I can offer the service of giving people what they want. And even more than that - I give a warranty. No more losing what you so dearly desired, you understand,' the snake tells you in a quite smooth-talking voice, guiding you in a tour through the store, past numerous of the motionless living dolls. While you walk, your gaze falls upon a treasure-trove of supplies stacked up in the back. He must have weeks forth of food and water there! Curiosity drives you to check it out from up close, but after a few steps, the naga's hand slides under your and gently but firmly tugs you back to his tour. Then you notice that every last one of the mannequins in the whole store turned their head towards you when you came close to the supplies. They quickly take their positions again, but you can't help but shiver a little from so many featureless faces staring at you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Finally arriving back where you started after having shown off all sorts of creature parts you never even knew existed, Moreau smiles and shows his forked tongue for a second. 'As you can see, I do have much to offer. It depends a bit on what people sell to me, so be sure to get anything you desire immediately, so it is not sold out by the time you return. You will find the prices very reasonable for this unique service...'";

When this all started, seeing all the changes happening around this city had started to give me some vague ideas along the lines of this shop, but it wasn't until I stumbled on a discarded mannequin on the side of the road that those ideas really clicked together. And so I came here, as I knew there'd be plenty of mannequins to work with, and with a bit of my own magical talent was able to convert the mannequins you see here from their inert state to something more suitable for my purposes. The process took some refining, but I think the result has been well worth it all.'";

I do not wish to frighten away my customers after all.' He gives you a smile at that, which was probably meant to be ressuring, but ends up a little more sinister. You nod to him, gesturing for him to continue talking.";

I fought and defeated it, and nearly left it there, until the idea of this shop occurred to me. This form has given me certain... powers of persuasion, which I used to bring the mannequin under my control. Having seen what they do to those they defeat, and not wishing to have to fight and collect them one by one, I had the idea to transform an ordinary mannequin. I tested the idea on an inert mannequin from a nearby store, and finding that it had worked, led my two new mannequins here to collect more from the abandoned stores. So yes, one of my mannequins is from out in the city. Perhaps it was once a person, but there was no way for me or anyone else to tell. The rest were all created from inert mannequins. I've harmed no one, and they're all completely under my control. Does that satisfy you?'";

Now that your curiosity is satisfied, perhaps you'd like to look around the shop and see if anything catches your eye?' Telling him that you will, you step away, returning to looking around the store.";
