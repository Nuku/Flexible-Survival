		say "     As you submit to the little demon, the imp puffs up his chest and gives an imperious nod, then starts to smile. His too-broad mouth pulls into a wide grin showing off a whole row of sharp teeth and he calls out, 'Not as stupid as you look, I see. At least some mortals realize they are no match for demonic powers, hah! Strip naked slave!' After those words, the foot-tall being flutters around you as you obey and take off your gear and clothes, dropping them to the ground one by one. The imp demands that you take some lewd poses to show off - like shaking and spreading your ass or air-humping with your crotch - then commands you to lie down on your back. With a flutter of wings, he lands on your chest a moment later, placing tiny hooves to stand on your breastbone.";
	else:[player loses]
		say "     You are left swaying badly after the last hit of the little demon and the imp gives an evil chuckle as he flies right up to your face in a flutter of wings. With his too-broad mouth pulling into a wide grin showing off a whole row of sharp teeth, he reaches out to poke your forehead with one finger, then gives a small shove - enough to make you keel over backwards. 'You really should have realized that you're no match for me! I'm a demon, dumb-fuck!' With those words, the foot-tall being lands on your chest, placing tiny hooves to stand on your breastbone.";
	say "     'Oh yeah, that's definitively the proper place for a mortal,' the red-skinned humanoid gleefully says as he taps his right hoof on your chest and rubs his crotch. Wearing nothing but a threadbare loincloth, it is painfully obvious that the demon is hard as a rock - his well-sized cock (for the small body-size) standing straight out under the fabric and tenting it. He clearly gets off on ordering others around. With the flick of a clawed hand, your little captor pulls aside the loincloth a moment later, revealing his bright red shaft and starting to jerk it off with gleeful intensity.";

	say "     'You're nothing but a weak little mortal brought down by my might and power, are you? Go on - say it!' he demands from you while beating off, and given your current position you've got little choice but to obey. This arouses the imp even more, prompting him to play with his balls - squeezing them while stroking his shaft faster and faster. Soon, the groans and grunts of his surprisingly deep voice build to a half-shouted roar, and he bucks his hips against the hand gripping his cock, spraying long blasts of cum all over your face. The sheer volume of demonic seed he puts out is almost admirable - but what isn't is the face that he purposely aims to hit you in inconvenient places like up your nose or in an eye. Thankfully, the little fucker doesn't have good aim, but eventually you're forced to close your eyes tightly as a splashed line of cum covers your cheek up to your forehead.";
	say "     With closed eyes, you feel the warmth and wetness of further spurts even more clearly as the imp creams your face, then chin and neck as his orgasm slowly ebbs off. The next thing you feel is his hooves stepping forward a bit and little hands bracing against your jaw as the imp half climbs your face, then demands that you stick out your tongue. 'That's a good fucktoy!' he giggles as you obey, then taste his spicy cum as he wipes off his prick on your tongue. His tiny hands rub over your face, seemingly smearing the cum splashes all over it - but then you realize that he's actually scooping it up to do some finger-painting on your forehead. You feel him draw the letters B, I, T, C and H on your skin in his still warm cum, giggling as he does so.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Well well - it's been fun playing with you, slut. Wish I could just keep ya, but it'd be a pain to drive you to the hell-gate through this fucked-up monster nest of a city,' the imp says to you and smiles as you carefully open the eye that hasn't got demon cum splashed on its eyelid. Then he grimaces a little and admits, 'And I was only supposed to find you anyways. The big boss - Skarnoth - called dibs on ripping you a new one after your stunt of stealing that angel dick-bait. So... you're fucked, haha! Gonna be dragged to hell and get an introduction to his demon dong. Well - eventually, you will. The pack of hellhounds that was supposed to come along with me and the others is busy enjoying the sights of this place for the moment - chasing down people to chew on and hump - but they'll get around to collecting you soon when the boss gets impatient and breaks out the choking collars. Should take two days or three, tops. And you can forget about hiding - getting a facial with infernal cum leaves a mark they can sniff out from miles away!' Pulling his loincloth aside again and lewdly wagging a half-hard cock at you, the imp gives a cruel laugh and then takes off, flying out of sight in a few moments.";

[bold type]You have two - or three - days before a ravening pack of hellhounds will sniff you out.[roman type] Thinking back to the fight between Elijah and the demons in the red light district, even one of those beasts was a dire threat... a whole pack of them would surely be too much to handle alone.

'Look, er... fighting you wasn't such a great idea, and... how about we call a do-over, hm? I'll just... be on my way, and you can do whatever you were doing before. No hard feelings, right?' he says and gives a somewhat desperate smile, showing a surprisingly wide mouthful of sharp, little teeth.

Seems like that fucking imp left a lasting stain that connects you to the pack of hellhounds hunting in the city. If it can just... flare up again and his load re-appears on your face, you don't doubt that the beasts will sniff you out soon! They might have gotten distracted again this time, but who knows how long that will last...";

Thinking for a second it is just another vision of the hunting pack, it takes several valuable seconds before you realize that this time, the hellhound is actually there with you. As you whirl around, you see the large beast in all its terrible glory - about as large as a small pony, the demon hound has jet-black fur and a powerful build, muscles rippling under his skin as he makes another step towards you. Eyes burning with an inner green glow play their gaze over you and his lips draw back, revealing countless sharp teeth. And that's not the only thing that is shown to you - the hound's blood-red shaft pushes out of its sheath in anticipation of running you down.";

Whirling around to face him, a throaty chuckle makes you glimpse to the side for a second and spot the next one. There are three hellhounds, surrounding you on all sides! Number two suddenly lunges forward, biting with slavering jaws - but that is only a feint, and the real attack comes from behind as two plate-sized paws hit you in the back and you stumble and fall.";

Pushing you down and growling in savage amusement, they rip your clothes and gear to shreds... mostly without giving you more than just a few nips with their teeth. Finally, the lead hellhound steps over your body and grabs your neck between his powerful jaws to hold you tight and lines himself up with your body. With a savage thrust, the beast fills you with its knotted cock, then fucks you mercilessly until breeding your hole with a heavy load of demon cum. One after another, they all take turns using you, going again and again until you're nothing but a cummy mess. Only after that are you dragged over the back of the lead hound by one of his pack-mates, then carried to the portal they entered your world through.";

Small as you may be, from high up everyone looks tiny and weak - which makes you feel powerful and strong. They're just insects to you, mortal mayflies to be played with. Before long, your search bears fruit - there is a small group of people holed up on top of a building, uninfected humans that have the stairwell barricaded and cower from the monsters below in a shack on the roof. Of course, this doesn't protect them from you as you, with your wings and demonic powers. With little more than a few fireballs thrown around, you frighten them into obedience and gain a flock of fucktoys to serve your every whim. This even goes so far that they never even dare to try calling out to the soldiers as they sweep the city, instead hiding according to your commands and being left behind - all yours, forever.";

With your small stature and demonic looks, it isn't easy to find a new place in the post-nanite world, but the fact that you do have functional wings does pay off in the end and you're hired as a courier by the 'Skymail' express delivery service. Supplanting the bike couriers of the big cities, the mixed crew of gryphons, harpies and even demons just like yourself does quite well, and before long the bigger companies usually have a little balcony added to their high rises for speedy drop-offs. As you and those like you become part of the typical day to day of many people - regularly swooshing past over their heads with important documents - the distrust about looking like a demon lessons bit by bit too. Sure, you get splashed with holy water by bigots once in a while, but that becomes the exception as society integrates all the new species of new people...";
