to say Imp loses:
	say "     With a screech and an aborted flutter of wings, the imp crashes down, face-planting onto the ground. A groan comes from his throat as the little demon lets his wings slacken, then pushes himself up enough to focus on you with his big, expressive eyes. 'Look, er... fighting you wasn't such a great idea, and... how about we call a do-over, hm? I'll just... be on my way, and you can do whatever you were doing before. No hard feelings, right?' he says and gives a somewhat desperate smile, showing a surprisingly wide mouthful of sharp, little teeth. Snorting at the new tone coming from the formerly so boisteous creature, you pluck him off the floor with one hand and start thinking about what to do with him. ";

Wearing nothing but a thin, skimpy loincloth that sways from side to side with every motion, there is little doubt that this tiny demon is male.";
	say "     Swooping down on you, the imp gives you a lewd grin before clearing his throat and booms out in a demonic tone. 'Kneel! You're now mine, mortal!' The voice does have a proper horror film ring to it, but the effect is pretty underwhelming considering how small he is. You can't quite suppress a snort at how poorly his larger than life bravado goes with his tiny body, drawing you a hateful glare from the imp. 'We'll see who's laughing after I give you a well-deserved thrashing, welp!' he shouts and raises a hand, forming a ball of fire above his palm about an inch in diameter.";
