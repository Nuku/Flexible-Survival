A dusty box sits on the low sofa table he has dragged close and is apparently in the progress of unpacking. Small stacks of old, sometimes damaged-looking books are spread out next to him as he takes stock. Looking up from the box, Eric smiles at you and calls out, 'Hey there - look what I found back in one of the storerooms! I got bored just sitting around and since it is so dangerous to go outside, I looked around a bit in here...' Leaning forward, the college athlete pulls another item out of his mystery box - an old crucifix made from blackened wood this time.";

Curiosity makes you step up closer and check the crosses out - are they supposed to look... singed? Then Eric suddenly pulls a thick book out of the box, bound in black leather. 'Hey, this looks interesting. And old... I wonder what it is about.' The book - well, more like a tome actually - is clearly quite old and looks heavy enough to break someone's foot if dropped. It bears a triangle symbol with a slit-pupiled eye on the front, branded into the leather.";

Elbows braced on the mattress, his head is bent over the book and he seems to be studying with an intent gaze. Curious, you wander over to the college student and glance over his shoulder. The page he is looking at is filled with strange curving squiggles, following no script you can really recognize. Clearing your throat, you manage to draw Eric's attention away from the book after a few seconds and he looks up at you with a curious expression.";

'Hey!' Eric reacts with a slight delay, almost as if he had been in a trance. 'I was reading that, give it back!' the red-headed college student complains, but you tell him in a friendly, but firm, tone that you'll have to check this thing out for yourself first. He reaches out in a bid to snatch the book back, but you keep it out of his reach. Finally, he sits up and gives a sigh, then adds, 'Fine. I'll get something else to read then.' With a somewhat sullen expression on his face, Eric walks off towards the stairwell.";

Sweat glistens on his face and he is breathing quickly, letting out some sudden pants from time to time. His feet and legs seem especially agitated, twitching and moving under the blanket. Concerned, you step forward in order to feel his forehead for fever and in doing so, hit something with your foot. It is the leather-bound tome Eric has been reading lately. Must have fallen off the bed due to Eric's fidgeting. It lies there, opened with the face down. Somehow you can't help yourself and pick it up. One of the images Eric mentioned is visible in between the strange text on the open page - a depiction of countless black tentacles that almost seems to move as you look at it.";
		say "     Suddenly, Eric lets out a noise that you can only describe as a moan and bucks his hips up under the blanket. With the ancient tome still held in your arm, you feel the college student's forehead - sweaty, but not feverish. Deciding that waking him should would be best, you shake Eric by the shoulder after that, but he just groans a little with his eyes closed, no further sign of coming to except that. And then it hits you - he may be twitching unruly in his sleep, but unless Eric has suddenly grown an... extra appendage between his legs, there is one too many bulges under that blanket!";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Throwing the book aside to bounce off the next row of beds and tumble behind them, you wrench the blanket off Eric. He is far from sleeping alone! More than a dozen jet-black tentacles are snaked up around the edge of his mattress at the foot of the bed, seemingly in constant movement as they wrap around and stroke Eric's lower legs and thighs. One strand of the appendages is thicker than the rest and comes to a somewhat bulbous end. That tentacle is right between your transgendered friend's legs, rubbing back and forth over his crotch and leaking a slow but steady throb of clear slimy fluid on him. It rears up almost like a cobra at suddenly being exposed like this, turning the head as if to look at you with its vertical slit.";
		say "     The creature's tentacle cock turns from you to Eric's pussy, then back to you and it spurts out a small string of further... goop, or pre-cum, or lube? Doesn't take much to guess what it is trying to tell you, as the other tentacles wrap even tighter around Eric's body and the big one tenses, as if to ready itself for movement.";

			LineBreak;
			say "     In the blink of an eye, the tentacle cock strikes, plunging in between Eric's nether lips and making the transgendered teen buck and moan on the bed - still asleep though, with not even being fucked able to wake him from the clearly unnatural slumber. [if EricVirginityTaken is 0]A groan leaves his mouth as the relentless plunge breaks through Eric's hymen, losing his virginity to this black-tentacled beast - and that without Eric even consciously realizing it. [end if]The creature worms into him deeper and deeper while its other tentacles seem to hold the college student in a firm but gentle embrace, making sure he isn't pushed back or accidentally falls out of the bed while thrashing and moaning in helpless lust. You can't help but gape as his belly starts to bulge out a little, showing the shape of the tentacle cock's head - the creature pushed all the way into Eric's womb!";
			say "     You watch with tense attention as Eric gets tentacle-fucked hard and deep, the thick appendage between his legs writhing and throbbing as it thrusts into his pussy and womb again and again. Satisfied burbling noises come from beneath the bed as the creature violates the sleeping college student, its sounds of pleasure eventually rising in a way that reminds you of a kettle about to boil. Then the smaller gripping tentacles suddenly tighten their hold on the naked human and you can literally see a series of slightly thicker bulges move up the tentacle cock in a rapid progression. Before you can even think of maybe doing anything about that, the first heavy throb of monster cum gushes deep into Eric, followed by countless others.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The pulsing and throbbing of the black tentacle cock seems endless, delivering its fertile load into the trans teen's [if EricVirginityTaken is 0]receptive [end if]body. You've long lost count by the time you find yourself stepping forward a little bit more and laying a hand on the slowly swelling belly on Eric. You can literally feel each spurt of cum blasting into him! Eventually, the monster's orgasm slowly ebbs off when he looks a month or two pregnant, with a visible bulge to his tummy. By that time, the creature loosens its hold on Eric and retracts appendages under the bed, with the thick shaft between his legs being the last one. Slipping out of Eric's pussy with a wet slurp and a gush of cum from his over-filled body, the tentacle rears up for a moment, aiming its cock-head at you as if its dripping cum-slit was an eye.";
			say "     The thing seems to wink at you, closing and opening in quick secession, then splurts out a last gob of off-white cum and sinks out of sight behind the bed. Maybe a message - but it's anyone's guess what that was supposed to mean. Crouching down, you look under the bed... and there's nothing there, just empty air. With a shrug, you turn your attention back to Eric - who is still out for the count, despite everything that has happened to him just now! The steady trickle of monster cum from between his legs has the potential to make a hell of a mess of the bed, so you quickly snatch up the t-shirt he took off before going to bed and position the bunched-up fabric under his crotch to soak up what it can. Snatching up another piece of usable fabric, you then start working on cleaning him up from all the other goop that came off the tentacles, and Eric's own sweat from being fucked.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     It'll be better if he doesn't wake up all slimed up - since the college student slept through the whole situation, he otherwise would be in for quite a shock. You'll have to see what he will or will not remember when he wakes up. By the time you're done cleaning up everything that made his naked body wet and sticky, Eric's belly has gone down to normal once more, no longer showing the slight bulge all the cum gave it. The t-shirt between his legs is a soppy mess as you pull it away and do a final wipe over Eric's pussy with your other cum-rag. Well, that's about as good as this will get - from looking at him now, you couldn't tell he was fucked by a tentacle monster ten minutes ago. With a concerned look at the young guy's now peaceful face, you cover him with a blanket again and go pick up the tome. It clearly has something to do with all this. Better to confiscate it and keep it out of Eric's hands for now unless you want to see a repeat of this...";

				LineBreak;
				say "     Throwing yourself forward, you manage to intercept the tentacle cock - barely - as it pounces on Eric. Hands closing around the wriggling appendage, you stop it short just before it touches the moaning trans-boy's crotch and burrows in between his nether lips. In reply, a strange burble of sound from under the bed seems to express the creature's displeasure. The tentacle in your grip splurges another throb of defiant ooze over Eric's crotch, then begins to writhe against your hold as you pull it away from him. Further black tentacles snake from beneath the bed or let go of Eric to attack you and things quickly escalate to a full-on wrestling match between the monster and yourself.";
				say "     The smaller tentacles move frantically against you - wrapping around anything they can reach or snaking directly under your clothing to touch you in rather intimate places, leaving behind slimy feelings of ooze against your skin. A few times as you let go with one hand to deal with such mostly annoying distractions, the big tentacle cock almost writhes out of your grasp, really throwing around every little bit of power in it. But no, you keep hold of it with grim determination, resisting any attempt to pull away and turn back on its original target, creating a considerable amount of frustration for the beast (if you are judging the sound of wet clay being punched correctly that comes from beneath the bed).";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Then suddenly, the creature switches tactics and instead does its best to subdue you directly! Its smaller appendages squeeze tighter around your arms and legs, with the tentacle cock now trying to... head-butt you? At least that's the least disturbing option why it keeps pushing towards your face. It is quite hard to keep hold of the slimy shaft of its cock, especially as it now pushes itself through the grip of your hands lengthwise, no longer trying to worm away sideways. The worst thing is that it seems to be enjoying your hands firm hold, leaking more of its slimy pre-cum that gets flung everywhere as you wrestle - hitting yourself, the sheets and even stretched-out Eric with clear splatters of goop.";
				say "     The sounds coming from beneath the bed quickly increase in intensity, kinda reminding you of a kettle that is about to boil over. And fitting to that, the energy of the creature's struggle builds in turn, surprising you with a sudden wrench that almost flings you off the bed. Somehow you can hold on but in the course of which get struck in the cheek by the rubbery dickhead, leaving a trail of goop on your face. Pushing the tentacle away from your head with both hands, you soon come eye to... cum-slit with it and really have to strain as it resists you with all its might. Then the vertical opening almost seems to wink, closing and reopening even wider than before - followed by a splurge of off white monster cum hitting you right in the face!";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     In shock, you can do little but squeeze your lids shut and try not to get any goop in your eyes. As you feel another spurt and another of the creamy cum cover your features, you realize that an outcome like this was kinda inevitable - you've been basically jerking the creature off by wrestling with its cock! Well, at least you managed to keep it from getting to Eric - or entering your mouth... a small consolation to being creamed by this tentacled creature. As the further splurges of its seed ebb off, the beast starts to pull back - retracting its smaller appendages and tugging the big one against your grasp. With a shrug, you let go and raise your hands to wipe the goop off your face.";
				say "     By the time you can open your eyes again without the danger of something oozing into them, there is no sight at all of the creature. It must have vanished under the bed once more, leaving behind yourself and Eric in a somewhat bedraggled and slimy state. You lean over the edge of the bed and peer at the space beneath - it is empty, with only a few trails of slime indicating that something was there just moments ago. With a sigh, you sit up and take stock of the situation. Eric is surprisingly still asleep - it really must have dosed him with something or other - naked and with his crotch glistening wetly from its external stimulation. You yourself are fairly slimy too, both with the creature's pre as well as cum, so you start to wipe it all up with the worn t-shirt Eric must have taken off before going to bed.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Soon dabbing away the last of the cum on Eric's crotch with a gentle touch, you look down at his naked form and hope that whatever the monster did to him will wear off soon. It'll be better if he doesn't wake up all slimed up - since the college student slept through the whole situation, he otherwise would be in for quite a shock. You'll have to see what he will or will not remember when he wakes up. With a concerned look at the young guy's now peaceful face, you cover him with a blanket again and go pick up the tome. It clearly has something to do with all this. Better to confiscate it and keep it out of Eric's hands for now.";
			else:
				LineBreak;
				say "     You throw yourself on the ground and look under Eric's bed, coming face to... black mass with an azure blue slitted eye. The creature hisses and seems to recoil from actually being observed, then quickly disintegrates into a cloud of black dust that vanishes into nothingness in a few seconds. Phew, good thing that monsters under people's beds do not like to be looked at! You make doubly sure that it really is gone, halfway crawling under the bed yourself and groping around, then even checking under the bunched up blanket you wrenched off the bed. Relieved that you seem to be alone for the moment, you then stand up again and check on Eric.";
				say "     He still is in a state of oddly deep sleep, not having woken up from anything that happened so far. You just hope that this will pass given enough time. As there is nothing much else you can do right now, you grab the t-shirt Eric took off before going to sleep and gently dab it at his crotch, wiping away the goop that the creature squirted on him. It could be the reason he is in that sleep-trance after all, and Eric would surely be freaked out if he woke up all slimed up. With a concerned look at his now peaceful face, you cover him with a blanket again and go pick up the tome.
