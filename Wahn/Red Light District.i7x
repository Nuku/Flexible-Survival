You catch the scent of what you guess to be [one of]a hyper-masculine creature[or]some kind of feline creature[or]a strong latex source[or]a dark and powerful female[or]arousing pollen[or]a large marsupial[or]an arousing perfume[or]a herm and cheap sex[at random], making your head swim a bit before you shake the sensation off.";

Some piles of uncollected trash litter the street, and towards the [Bold Type]east[roman type], a modestly sized chapel rises above the surrounding buildings. Sadly, its white walls are marred by the signs of a recent fire within, with the flames having licked out of the shattered windows to blacken areas above and besides them. The large inverted pentagram that someone has clawed into the timbers of the wooden front door tells you that what befell the chapel wasn't an accident either. To the [Bold Type]southeast[roman type] lies an apartment building with a busted front door, which nevertheless looks more lived-in than most of the other buildings all around.";

instead of smelling Boundary Street East:
	say "     The aroma of fire and ash is ever-present in your nose, so close to the burned chapel. Of course, this doesn't reduce the other scents present, so you can also smell sex, with a musky scent of arousal hanging thick in the air.";
