Soon you find your nose bumping against the perfect and smooth skin of his pubic mount. 'Not bad, as a fucktoy,' he says under his breath, then takes hold of your head and starts to face-fuck you in earnest. Pumping in and out faster and faster, it doesn't actually take all that long until he orgasms, shooting his seed deep in your throat.

He grabs hold of your head, bending it back so you can see his severe expression. 'Last chance now, submit!' the hunter adds, yet you simply shake your head as much as you can, with him still holding onto you. At that point, the hint of a smile crosses his face. 'Contrary till the very end, eh? If only you had shown such resilience during our fight as well. Still, this is a promising sign at least. Maybe I just encountered a particularly weak example of your people, with others having both the spirit and the strength.' It seems that the elf is picking his words specifically to goad and anger you, and you can see a hint of calculated contentment in his eyes as your features inevitably pull into a hostile stare.";

Soon, he drives himself over the edge, aiming his erection right at your face to cover it in fresh, elven cum. One of his spurts lands on your right eyelid, which you barely close in time to avoid the sting of cum getting on your eyeball. Keeping both eyes closed as a precaution after that, you obviously don't see anything further, but you hear the elf give a little chuckle, with his fingers grabbing your jaw and moving it left and right to inspect his handiwork. Then his voice comes, quite close to your ear so he must have bent down to you as he says, 'Think of this moment, when you wander the crumbling ruins of your world. Maybe a bit of humiliation and anger will motivate you to perform better next time. I look forward to that.' Everything is silence after that point, and by the time you wipe your face and can open your eyes again, the elf is long gone.";

'We'll have to see if any of these people are worth the time of the Hunt,' the elf says with a shrug. 'Most will hide in their little homes when they hear the beat of the hooves near, and what use is that for anyone? Easy enough to take down, and no challenge at all. But I guess even among the broader population, there can be outstanding individuals. Those that are aiming to supplant their betters, or the loyal retainers of popular rulers. Let us go and observe more closely, and see if we can find them.' That said, Castien reaches out to touch your arm, murmuring some arcane incantation as he does so.

The companions of the two of them negotiating with each other keep lookout for the other side trying anything, or outside interference. For a moment, one of them seems to look right at you, before his gaze drifts on along the street, Castien's spell easily outdoing his powers of observation. Despite their intent of providing security though, it seems that these people are still thinking too two-dimensional, as an attack from above doesn't seem to have crossed their minds.

With a sharp beak being brought close to their faces and the hawkmen screeching directly at them, the survivors quickly surrender. Castien glances over to you, rolling his eyes at the weak showing. His green eyes narrow to thin slits, watching dispassionately as the hawkmen rip and tear clothing out of the way, allowing them to start fucking their captives soon after.";
			say "     With all the noise of boastful hawkmen and sex being made around you, there is little danger of anyone overhearing and pinpointing you, so Castien casually comments, 'See what I meant? That was just pathetic. Though the feathered ones might serve as some entertainment. Depends a bit on how smart they turn out to be - too stupid and or aggressive prey will just try to attack a hunter, and what challenge is it to take down something simply running straight at you?

This appears to draw Castien's attention, and he makes a hand-sign to follow the pair. Clearly in a good mood, the hyenas often quite lewd humor is shared with the world, sometimes shouted at other people coming into sight, who generally hurry to get gone at that point. Soon, the pair saunters up to a well-sized home, coming up to the front door and banging against it impatiently.";

Accepting it, the first hyena weighs it in her hand, then growls, 'Feels a bit light!' before handing it to her partner, who starts to dig around in the bag. 'P-please!' the man in the house says in almost a whimper, 'This is the last we had! There literally isn't anything more I could give you, we're already going hungry. 'Tough luck! You really want to force us to check?' hyena number two tells him threateningly, baring her sharp teeth in a gesture that is decidedly not a smile. Her companion reaches out at that point, holding the other hyena back. 'Wait, I'm sure that our little buddy here wouldn't be stupid enough to keep something from us. Ain't that right, dude?'

With that, she steps into the house laying her arm around his shoulders and presses the metal can to his chest, with him accepting it in shaking fingers. 'Since we're all such good friends now, there's one more thing I'd like to know though,' the hyena tells the human, her hand clamping down on his shoulder now as he gulps.

Hah, won't they be surprised when they find themselves being the prey for a change once the Hunt arrives!' You see a grin grow on his face, revealing canines somewhat longer than on a man. His slitted eyes narrow to a sharp focus and the whole image reminds you of a cat eager for stalking and bringing down its target. Seeing his reaction flip around this quickly reminds you that Castien isn't actually human, and has a viewpoint that may be hard to follow for someone of another species.

Informing your elven companion of this, he nods and raises an eyebrow. 'Now what could have brought down this flying machine of your people?' Castien asks with interest, walking closer to have a look. Poking around a bit, you find a large piece of the rotor, which has its moving parts crusted over by some dried resin. Looking at it, you doubt that it'd do a delicate machine all that good to be gunked up like this. Might have been partly responsible for the crash.";

He then crouches down to point at the side door of the helicopter, which appears to have been somewhat crumpled up. Reaching under it, he pulls a broken-off claw-tip out and holds it up. The piece of keratin is at least six inches long, and from its curvature it is clear that it is only the very tip of a quite large claw. 'The beast that this belongs to makes coming to this world worth it all on its own. The others will be overjoyed to see that there finally are big lizards again on earth!' Proudly wrapping his find in a piece of silken fabric, he mutters some arcane words under his breath, causing the whole bundle to disappear into thin air.

The curve of her stomach indicates that a clutch of eggs is soon to come. 'It seems like my people are not the only visitors to your world right now,' Castien says in a quiet tone, a curious expression on his face. 'Though I have to say, I've never seen one of their race so close to bearing eggs being out and about. Pregnant hens usually are well-protected in a nest by this time.'";

Then suddenly he says, 'Wait a minute!' and quietly intones a spell, which makes his eyes glow from within. Focusing on the person in the tree, he states, 'That's a human! Well, was a human anyways. Originally.' He taps his chin as he says this, followed by a smile. 'The fact that your people are so eagerly stealing the forms of other beings does open up some opportunities that I hadn't yet accounted for. It will be interesting to hunt a gryphon, who is at the same time not a gryphon. That one might have completely different reactions and tactics to the ones we know.
