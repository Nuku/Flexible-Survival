'Contrary till the very end, eh? If only you had shown such resilience during our fight as well. Still, this is a promising sign at least. Maybe I just encountered a particularly weak example of your people, with others having both the spirit and the strength.'

Keeping both eyes closed as a precaution after that, you obviously don't see anything further, but you hear the elf give a little chuckle, with his fingers grabbing your jaw and moving it left and right to inspect his handiwork. Then his voice comes, quite close to your ear so he must have bent down to you as he says, 'Think of this moment, when you wander the crumbling ruins of your world. Maybe a bit of humiliation and anger will motivate you to perform better next time. I look forward to that.'

Looking at you with a curious expression and his head tilted a little, you can't tell if Castien is intrigued or off-put by that possibility.

Still, the elf reacts very well to your hands on him, touching and stimulating his body as he pleasures himself. Pretty erotic actually, to just play with him like this, and you enjoy every minute of it until Castien gets kind of close, judging from his breathing coming kind of quick and shallow. Then suddenly, the elf winks at you and says, 'Okay, you take over now - bet it'll be extra special if you milked it yourself, ha!'

Jerking him a little, and pinching his nipples with your free hand, you milk all the cum you can get out of your otherworldly visitor, until he eventually pats your wrist to show that he's done and getting kind of sensitive.

While you take out a pen and label the bottle, the elf gets dressed again. He looks at your fresh bottle of elven cum and chuckles as you carefully pack it away.

For a second, you wonder who the 'we' is that he's referring to, but the question answers itself as two more leopardmen come sprinting around the corner at the end of the block. They must have split up to cut off the woman's avenues of escape. Now all three of them close in around her and she's pulled along to wherever they make their den. Castien watches them go with a dispassionate expression, only commenting when the group is out of earshot. 'Prosperity creates its own predators, that is true in any world I've seen so far.

Stepping into the light, the person who spoke reveals himself to be an enormous anthro wolverine, so bulging with muscles that he burst the seams of his 'Wolverine Security' jacket. The nightstick in his large, clawed paws looks almost like a toy in comparison to the anthro's bulk. 'Wait, you can see us?' Castien inquires, curiosity audible in his voice.

Clearing his throat, your elven companion tells the guard, 'We did not mean to intrude. You can stand down and we will leave.' Tapping your arm, he walks away from the building in an unhurried tempo before eventually speaking up again. 'Mmmh, those people certainly seem secure, but they don't seem happy about it.

Waiting for the cat to be out of earshot, Castien taps his chin and comments, 'Looks like someone's pet got out, or maybe they were separated. Could be an interesting bit of prey, that one.

This is the Elven Hunter Infection rule:
	if Player has a body of "Elven Hunter":
		trigger ending "Elven Hunter Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			say "     Feeling all attachments to humanity and this world fading, you make your way to the park and go looking for the elves. Soon you hear one, at first, then many hunting horns in the distance, but drawing closer and closer. A large party of elves on horses and other, less easily recognizable beasts, breaks through the underbrush and surrounds you. The elf you met before is among them, and invites you to accompany the hunt through this and other worlds. You accept, swinging yourself on top of a black stallion that gets brought forward for you, then ride with them into the magical mist of a large portal, leaving this world - for now.";
		else:
			say "     When rescue comes, you're first brought into a holding facility of the military. Thanks to your otherworldly, elven beauty, it turns out to be a relatively short, comfortable stay, as male and female soldiers and medical personnel find themselves strongly attracted to you. You bed a few of them to pass the time until your tests are done and you're released as non-infectious. Returning to human society brings problems with it, as some people just can't keep their hands off you once they see your perfect body. An... incident leading to a mid-sized orgy with a football team and all of the cheerleaders forces you to seek help from the elves.";
			say "     You spend the next three weeks hiking through woods and wilderness until you finally hear first one, then many hunting horns in the distance, then closer and closer. A large party of elves on horses and other, less easily recognizable beasts, breaks through the underbrush and surrounds you. The elf you met before is among them and invites you to accompany the hunt through this and other worlds. You thank him, but decline, asking instead for help with your little problem. The elves gladly teach you how to weave illusions over yourself before they move on, allowing you to hide your true nature and walk through cities without constantly being propositioned. Except when you want it, that is.";


Elven Hunter ends here.
