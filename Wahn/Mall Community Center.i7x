The line is moving fast, but almost as soon as one person gets to the front and walks off after being handed something, one or more new people queue up at the end. Curious, you casually walk along the line next to everyone and have a look. Guarded by a stoically observing wolverine, the desk holds a series of plastic tubs, bearing signs reading 'Regular', 'Large', and 'Horse Cock'. You immediately recognize the flat, square, and often colorful plastic wrappers: they're condoms! Manning the desk is a trio of anthro antelope women, with petite figures that match the light-boned build of their species. They are dressed in tank tops and shorts, casual wear that keeps them modest and approachable. All three of them look remarkably similar to one another, enough so for you to guess them to be fraternal triplets.";
	say "     Noticing your interest, one of the three women steps out from behind the desk and approaches you, a friendly smile on her face. 'You're welcome to join the line, too. We're open for anyone to get what they need, even if you don't live in the mall,' she says and looks down the lone line of people waiting, seeming pleased with the turn-out. You introduce yourself [if Player is not defaultnamed]as [name of Player] [end if]and tell her that you came over to see what all the commotion was about. She puts a hand to her chest and chuckles, then says, 'Oh, sorry. I guess I've gotten used to everyone knowing about us at the mall. My name is Florence, and these are my sisters, Marie and Olivia.

Yet where travel agents once sold their customers expensive trips all over the world, there are now groups of people, hanging out together, chatting, playing games, and also organizing supplies. One corner of the large office floor is sectioned off with a couple sheets, a sign reading 'Clinic' hung up next to it. Towards the north, you can see an open door with a sign on the wall that says, 'Accounting'. A large goo-person stands in it, blocking the way to a room beyond. Others of the aquamarine humanoids from time to time walk right through him, coming out to have a quiet word with one of the antelope sisters before returning into the back room. All of the goo people keep a respectful distance from anyone else in the center and even retreat when approached.";

to say FlorenceTalk_Background:
	say "     Smiling at your interest in her sisters and herself, yet somewhat sad at the same time, Florence says, 'We were born two weeks ago, to Jenevive Supinet as he was fleeing towards the Smith Haven Mall. You see, our mother is a veterinarian from the Vancouver Zoo, and she was here accompanying a rhinoceros cow being exchanged between zoos for a breeding program. I'm sure I don't have to explain how she got pregnant, with such fell acts being all too common these days.' Letting out a sigh at this point, she stays silent for a few seconds, then continues with a frown, 'Things didn't go well for mom after that either, as contractions set in long before she reached the mall. She had to find a quiet place to give birth in and suckle us until we were able to walk an hour or two later. Then, when we got on the road afterwards, it was a mad scramble to reach the Mall. We almost did, but barely two blocks away, a leopardman suddenly stepped into our way.'";
	say "     Florence scrunches up her muzzle in disgust, then says, 'He chuckled about his luck at getting four bitches in one go, then pointed out the order in which he was gonna fuck us. Mom hit him in the face with a long burst from a deodorant spray, and we ran like hell, but he quickly got on our tail. It was clear that he'd run us down, so she... she split off from us to lead him another way. Everything to let her little girls escape. And that's the last we've seen from her since.' After another deep sigh that speaks of her longing to be reunited with the mother she only briefly knew, the petite antelope shakes off her glum mood by focusing on her surroundings again, resting her gaze on a colorful image of a tropical beach. 'We've been doing our best to make use of the gifts that mom passed on to us. Drinking up a vet's experience with your mother's milk definitively came to our advantage here in the Mall.'";

to say FlorenceTalk_Condoms:
	say "     Florence listens to your question and nods, then indicates the desk for the condom handouts[if Player is in Haven Community Center] outside[end if]. 'If you want to know the reason for that, just look around you as you walk through the Mall, and the streets outside. This world, the world that me and my sisters have been born into and that shocks people from the before-time so much, it plays by hard and fast rules. Actions have consequences, and where once some stupid youngsters might perhaps have had to face the reality of a pregnancy months later, now they can fill an apartment complex with one weekend of humping.' Brushing a steak of hair out of her face and shaking her head at such foolishness, the antelope draws her lips into a line, then takes a deep breath before she adds, 'I've got a question for you: Where do you think all the ferals out there come from?'";
	say "     Looking at her a little puzzled, you start to say that they're those who transformed and succumbed, but the pretty antelope in front of you shakes her head with a sad expression. 'People tend to underestimate just how many humans simply died when the outbreak started, and how harsh life on the outside really is. Only through the unrestrained breeding going on everywhere is the population of ferals being upheld - and the newly born are often only feral in the first place because they are abandoned as soon as they are weaned.' [if Player is in Haven Community Center]Glancing at the desk outside and seemingly imagining the long line of people who regularly flock to it, [else]Looking at the long line of people waiting to get their condoms, [end if]Florence nods to herself, an expression of conviction that she and her sisters are changing the world for the better on her face.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Shaking herself out of her thoughts, the antelope focuses on you again and adds, 'And the second reason for doing this, besides saving beings from abandonment and a feral fate, is more pragmatic. It's simple sustainability, to be honest. No one knows for certain why many pregnancies rush to their conclusion within hours or days at best, and others have a traditional progression, but this definitively is a fact of life these days. And we simply cannot afford the risk that the first type of pregnancy holds for the Smith Haven Mall as a whole. The place is packed as it is, and unrestrained growth of the population could spell out doom for all of us.'";

to say FlorenceTalk_Pregnancies:
	say "     Clearing her throat, the slender antelope says, 'I've got a theory, if you want to hear it.' As you nod, she starts to explain, 'From most reports that we have of the outside, and my own knowledge of the pregnancy progression that mom went through, the rapid onset and conclusion of pregnancies on the streets is almost universal. Here in the mall, on the other hand, there is a wild mix of results: from slow cookers, like the humans in the before-time, to children being born quick but staying little, to insta-birth and growing up right away.' She gestures to underline what comes next. 'I think the difference is stress of the parent, and survivability for the child. The outside is so wild and harsh that any parent really can't be weighed down by carrying their offspring inside them too long. And a helpless child would never make it there.'";
	say "     Pantomiming the shell of the mall, with people inside, Florence adds, 'Meanwhile, inside this place, the infection doesn't seem to push things to quite the extremes that happen outside. But because of the worry for the future, post-traumatic stress, and tight confines, it still is a bit of a mixed bag, so it's anyone's guess what exactly will happen if someone gets pregnant even here.' She studies your reaction to what she just said for a moment, then adds, 'Please do remember: this is just a theory. It seems to match the facts, but we just can't be sure in the end. Which is why we're doing the condom project, not stress relief classes for new mothers. Sometimes one has to stay with what works for sure.'";

to say FlorenceTalk_Projects:
	say "     Florence smiles at your interest and says, 'We've got a few more projects and initiatives going on right now. For example, there are lessons for younger residents - both those who grow at human rates, as well as the adult-sized ones. Just because your parent passes on a bunch of knowledge doesn't mean that you know everything you need in life. Your mom or dad might have been totally disinterested in something critical. And the transfer isn't always complete, either. For example, Marie got a lot more medical knowledge than either Olivia or myself. That's why she leads the tiny [']clinic['] that we run to help people. Thankfully, the transformed do not stay hurt for long from most things that can happen to them. Still, humans and hybrids keep her busy, as well as people who are having problems with their new bodies.'";
	say "     With that said, Florence glances over to an anthro parakeet with patchy feathers [if Player is in Haven Community Center]just coming in for a check-up[else]standing in line for some condoms[end if]. Looks like hasn't quite figured out how to properly care for himself and is going through molting right now. Another thing that Florence points out next is an unobtrusive cooler box standing beside the condom handout desk. It bears the sign [']Returns['], and from time to time people come up to the box and quietly drops something inside. Looking closer the next time that this happens, you can make out that they are dropping in used condoms, filled with often quite significant deposits and tied together at the top. 'A number of our residents are quite extraordinary and do require special sustenance. Since they are wary of passing on an infection that makes people into humanoid blobs of goo, we've worked out this method of gathering the required fluids...'";
