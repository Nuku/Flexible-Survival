Could you do me a favor and blow me off?' Looking at you, then your crotch, the big lizard replies 'S-sure. I totally owe you for bringing Felix and me together.'";

As he opens his mouth and all those sharp teeth inside come into view, the thought that this was a bad idea shoots through your head for a moment, then quickly is pushes aside as Andre wraps his very long forked tongue around your cock. With him tonging your shaft, simultaneously licking and squeezing it, you're treated to a pretty unique oral sex experience. Andre's talented stimulation drives your arousal through the roof quickly, and before too long, you orgasm, shooting long strings of cum into the big lizard's mouth.";

to say AndreSex2: [sucking Felix cock]
	say "     Walking up to Andre, you run a hand over his long scaled neck, then along his body until you come to his hind legs. Smiling at the big lizard as he cranes his neck to see what you're doing, you move your hand lower towards his crotch and find the slit-like opening of his internal sheath. Rubbing it and then the quickly hardening cock emerging from it, you say 'Just relax, I want a taste of this.' He just moans as an answer.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     Getting down on the ground under the horse-sized lizard, you stoke his pointy and ridged erection, then lick over its underside, making Andre give a lustful hiss. You put your lips to the tip of his shaft and take it in your mouth, moving on to bobbing up and down on it after a while. There's quite a bit of cock your reptilian friend has, and when you reach the end of what you can take in, you put your hands to the rest of his shaft and stroke it in rhythm with your sucking. Getting expertly blown and jerked at the same time, it doesn't take too long until Andre's pants and hisses come quicker and more urgently, building up to a shouted 'I'm cumming!' A spicy taste fills your mouth as the first blast of his load paints your tonsils white and you quickly swallow it all to be ready for the next shot. Taking spurt after spurt of the tasty cum, you just keep suckling on Andre's cock until you got the very last bit of his load.";

He's got an amazing dexterity with it, making you moan as he concentrates on your clit, then pushes it in between your pussy lips, wiggling around inside your vagina. With the two ends of his tongue rubbing different spots, it's almost as if two persons are giving you attention simultaneously, giving a pretty unique oral sex experience. Andre's talented stimulation drives your arousal through the roof quickly, and before too long, you orgasm, femcum dripping out of your pussy to be licked up by the big lizard.";

Rubbing it and hearing the surprised hiss he makes, you say 'Relax, I just want to play a bit with your ass. You'll like it - and you want to train your muscles back here for Felix, don't you?' 'Err - of course,' he answers, and you can see his opening relax a bit.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     You bring your hand to his hole and start to massage it, rubbing it and the surprisingly sensitive underside of his long tail. Starting slow, you push one, then two fingers inside his ass, working them in and out a bit until he relaxes his muscles even more and you can add another finger. After a while, you got him loosened up enough that you can slip four fingers in - followed by your whole hand. Pushing deeper into the big lizard's body, you stroke his inner passage, grinning at the lust-filled hisses and moaning you create with that. Feeling around a bit, you find a spot that seems especially sensitive judging from the joyful gasps it makes Andre do every time you stroke over it. Concentrating on that, it doesn't take much longer until the big lizard orgasms, his sphincter gripping your arm tightly as spurt after spurt of cum blasts from his ridged cock and hits the ground.";
