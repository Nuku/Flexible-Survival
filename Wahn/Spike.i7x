	say "     Arriving back at the library, you are greeted by the sight of a male anthro doberman, leaning against the building's exterior wall close to the front entrance. He is casually smoking a cigarette, blowing out smoke as he watches you come closer. The doberman is a young adult, eighteen or nineteen from the looks of it, not that it means much anymore these days. He is dressed in a pair of ripped jeans, a skin-tight mesh shirt showing off his toned chest, as well as a loose-fitting collar around his neck, studded with spikes. With half of his head hair shaved off and the other half dyed neon-green, he certainly has a memorable look. 'Hey there, I'm Spike,' the canine says to you in a firm tone, clearly taking care not to sound too eager. 'I was told that you're the boss hereabouts,' he adds and takes a pull from his cigarette, blowing a puff of smoke into the air after a short moment.";
	say "     'So... I've had enough of being just one of the pack, and I was thinking that you need a right-hand man. I'm plenty tough and wanna see some action out there in the city, not just a few blocks around the lair. Come on, if you agree, the queen bitch in the library can't tell me off no more.' His last comment, combined with the young man's physical appearance finally makes something click in your mind, and you realize with a start who and what he is. You are talking with one of Alexandra's offspring, who clearly had a bit of a growth spurt recently, turning into this young man. From the looks of it, he's inherited a lot of the 'bad dog' attitude of his mother, and has decided to make a name for himself in a typical 'young tough guy' fashion - by becoming a hanger-on for the biggest, baddest person he knows: you. After all, you did make Alexandra your bitch.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With this new realization in mind, you take another look at Spike: this young canine looks about 18 years old and clearly has been working out a bit, giving him a toned but not too bulky physique that should serve him well in a fight. He shows a stoic and tough expression that you think must have been practiced and perfected in front of a mirror, yet he can't quite hide the excitement betrayed by his slowly wagging tail. When he realizes what you are looking at, Spike concentrates to stop the movement behind his back. The tension in his whole being is palpable, with the young dog waiting for you to reply to his offer.";

'Come on! You know that I can be very useful for you. I could keep your back protected when you fight a group of people, or be a lookout, and I have a [italic type]really[roman type] good nose too. I could sniff it out if someone wants to hide themselves or some nice stuff from you. Or all sorts of other things. You'd regret not having me along!' He's really putting everything he has into this plea, trying to show his toughness, but at the same time a bit of the typical 'puppy dog eyes' creeps into his expression too.";

Flinging the cigarette away with an angry flick of his wrist, the anthro canine grumbles, 'This is fucking stupid,' and looks to the ground sulkily. For a moment, it seems like he'll just reject your decision, but then he suddenly looks up at you and barks out, 'I thought that you'd be different. Like a real leader or something!' And with that, he turns his back to you, shuffling off to get back into the library.";

		say "     As you tell the young dog that he should go off on his own, he freezes in motion for a second, not sure what to reply. Clearly, this is one option that he hadn't even considered when he played through things in his mind. You see him swallow nervously, glancing to the library entrance for a second before he shakes his head to himself. 'Okay then, I'll do it,' Spike says, his firm tone sounding just a little bit brittle to your ears as he pushes himself off from the wall. 'I'm gonna go make my own way, out there. Alone in the city,' he adds, taking a few slow steps down the road as if waiting to hear you say that he passed the test and that you'll keep him now. But no, all you give him is a wish for good luck, which leaves Spike standing there for a moment longer, his back turned to you, before he runs away, not stopping for one second before he is out of sight.";

to say SpikeAccepted:
	say "     As you agree to take Spike along as your companion, his tail starts wagging up a storm and the young man says excitedly, 'Right on! We'll make this city ours! Let's have some fun!' With his hand lowering to rub the crotch of his jeans, you have little doubt what sort of 'fun' he expects to soon have. Taking another drag from his smoke, the anthro canine then flicks it aside and takes position by your side, steeling his expression to be properly tough and just a bit overbearing, as he expects the right-hand man of 'The Boss' would need to be.";

After all, you were the one who tamed the tough bitch that is my mom and brought her to the library. She had me and the others not much later. Living with all of them as a pack wasn't half-bad at first either. You should have seen the things that we did together! There are some corners in the library that... ah, but that's old news. Anyways, mom kept treating me like a pup even when I grew up. Hell, I was fully grown for days and she still lumped me in with the others. Got pretty annoyed with that shit, fast, so I started exploring the surrounding city blocks on my own. Anything to get out from under her paw a bit, you know?' Patting the leg of his ripped jeans and tugging on his skin-tight mesh shirt, the anthro doberman proudly explains that he found them scavenging.";
	say "     Then Spike goes on to grab his crotch, adjusting the penis-shaped bulge in it and says, 'After what happened next, I knew that I didn't just want to go back and spend all of my time cooped up in the library. Following the most amazing scent, I went down the street and into an alley, and there I met a bitch! Oh yeah, let me tell you, that husky slut was just asking for it. Totally in heat and ready to rub up against me from the first moment our eyes met. Damn, I still can't believe how good it felt to sink my bone into her, to take that needy bitch!' Now your canine companion is openly rubbing his dick through the fabric of his pants, caught up in the memory of losing his virginity. 'Well, I fucked her good! Tied with her and stayed on top till I had bred that pussy to the brim!'";

'When I got back home mom was angry about me just going off on my own and wanted to know what I had been doing. I told her exactly [italic type]whom[roman type] I had been doing, and that I was an adult now. That stupid bitch just laughed!' Intentionally raising his voice to sound a bit more like Alexandra, Spike says in a biting tone, 'Just because you got your dick wet doesn't mean that you're a man.' The young man shows a little bit of his teeth and growls under his breath, then barks out the words, 'I'll show her, and everyone else too! Things are gonna be great with me and you out in the city together!'";

The top bitch of the library, if you ask her, and someone I should apparently listen to and obey. Oh, don't misunderstand me, she was pretty nice to have as a mom when I was a pup, but definitively less so later.' Grumbling, Spike makes a fist, followed by a throwing-away gesture. 'It's just unfair, you know. I know a bit of how she thinks, ever since I was little and drank it up with her milk. Part of mom felt freed when she became your bad bitch; unrestrained in her lusts and desires, allowing herself to let stupid morality [italic type]go for good[roman type]. Hell, I grew up knowing just how much you can accomplish if you're powerful and ruthless enough. How was I supposed to stay her sweet little cub forever? Fuck that! I wanna get some action too!'";

to say SpikeTalk5: [military]
	say "     Bringing up the topic of the military and their presence in the city draws little attention from Spike. Only when you keep looking at him, one eyebrow raised as you wait for a reply does the young doberman say, 'Um, what about them? Isn't it some sort of loser gang or something? I got some inherited memories from mom and she thought they are supposed to be a big deal, but I've got my doubts. From what I've seen out in the city, lots of those soldiers got taken as sluts and breeding bitches by all sorts of creatures. Pretty weak and pathetic in my book.' Shrugging and putting aside all thought on the military, Spike clears his throat and adds, 'Now if you want a group that truly has to be reckoned with, just look at the hyenas. They're strong, take what they wand and no one fucks around with them, that's for sure!'";

to say SpikeTalk6: [food]
	say "     Mentioning the topic of food, spike stands up a little straighter and gives you a self-confident look. 'No need to worry about that with me [if thirst of Spike is 1][name of player][else]Boss[end if]. I know how to take care of myself and won't take up any of your supplies at all. There are lots of places where one can scavenge for good stuff and even if you don't find anything yourself, someone else out on the streets will have. Most of the time you just gotta wait till they start rutting with someone or something, then make off with the food. And if they wise up and try to stop me - I'm plenty tough enough to rough up someone who wants a beating.'";

Closing his muzzle to swallow and raising his eyebrows at the unexpected and enticing taste, Spike then goes back for more, licking over your dickhead again and again.";

			say "     You allow the young canine a little while of just slurping at your tip, then eventually move your hand to rub the base of his ears, which Spike clearly enjoys, before cradling the back of his head in your fingers. Slowly pushing his head forward, you tell him to take your dick. Spike's tail is still wagging up a storm behind his back as the eager doberman opens up his muzzle a little wider, allowing your erection to slide into it against the warm and slick surface of his floppy tongue. Holding his head steady with your hand, you pump in and out of his muzzle with steady thrusts, enjoying the warmth of his mouth around your manhood. Part of you longs to just go all out in face-fucking your companion, but you temper the impulse and instead give him a few well-meant tips on how to please a man, then slowly take your hand away from his head, stroking Spike's cheek as you do so.";
			say "     Finding himself suddenly without guidance, the canine pulls back a little and licks your dickhead again, then looks up, an unspoken question in his gaze. You simply give him a supportive smile and a nod, after which he starts doing his best to please you all on his own. Following an earlier suggestion, Alexandra's son leans in to lick at your balls, slurping over them and giving each one eager attention. Despite being totally new to it, he is quite good at giving oral pleasure, and it doesn't take long before you have to tell him to get his muzzle around your dick again, as you want to blow in his mouth when you come. The kneeling young man grins happily and replies, 'Just a second.' And with that said, he moves his hands to pull down the zipper of his pants, freeing a hard canine rod to stand erect as a flagpole.";

			say "     With his own cock in hand and jerking it in a frantic pace, Spike gets back to his first solo blowjob, bobbing on your cock in a very enthusiastic way. Except the need for a little reminder to cover his teeth with his lips, the young man really does a nice job of it, clearly a quick study - if motivated [italic type]properly[roman type]. Soon, you can't suppress moans and grunts anymore and just let them out, loudly letting your companion know that you are about to come. He just intensifies his attack on your manhood, closing his muzzle around it and sucking hard, which serves very well to push you over the edge in very short notice. Hands shooting forward to clamp onto his canine head, you hump into his muzzle and keep his nose pressed deep into your pubes as spurts of cum splash the back of his throat. While you keep hold of Spike up top and make him eat your load, he keeps jerking himself and barrels over the line of no return to his own climax just moments later.";
			say "     The young dobie grunts around the cock in his muzzle as he starts to shoot long streaks of sperm all over the ground between your legs, each spurt making his whole body twitch and tremble, including the tongue half-wrapped around your own shaft and giving you quite pleasurable sensations. Together, the two of you ride out your respective orgasms, until you eventually pull Spike off your now sensitive cock and help him to stand before you once more. Guiding his muzzle to your lips, you kiss him openly and suck on his tongue, tasting some of your own seed on it. With a teasing smile, you tell him that good things come to those who prove themselves to you, and that he will enjoy himself greatly as your companion. 'I'm sure that I will,' he answers and licks his muzzle, then pushes his softening cock back into his jeans and zips himself up.";

After all, how can you count on him for important tasks if he even fails at the most simple things you give him as a test. Something even the most stupid slut you could pick up on the street would be capable of doing. Spike's face is a study of emotions as you make your accusation-filled little speech, going from disapproval, to shock, to a deep worry. He gulps when you come to a stop, looking at him expectantly, then slowly sinks to his haunches. A grin spreads over your face when you look at the trembling canine on the ground before you, especially as he gulps nervously when you push aside your clothes to free your [cock of player] shaft to stand erect before his eyes.";

Spike lets out a somewhat choked gasp at suddenly being man-handled, his eyes wide in fear as your merciless gaze studies his face. Telling him that he gave himself to you, with everything this implies, you then physically push him down, making the anthro canine fall to his knees before you.

Not a bitch to service anyone - even you.' Giving him a little squeeze with your hand and nodding to the impressionable young man, you tell Spike that you'll respect his position. His tail wags left and right at this show of being treated 'right', and it's confirmed in his stance. Looks like your decision did cost you the immediate pleasure of enjoying the doberman's mouth, but gained you a new level of devotion from your young follower.";
