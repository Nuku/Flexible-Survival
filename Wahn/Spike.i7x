He is casually smoking a cigarette, blowing out smoke as he watches you come closer. The Doberman is a young adult, eighteen or nineteen from the looks of it, not that it means much anymore these days. He is dressed in a pair of ripped jeans, a white mesh shirt showing off his toned chest, as well as a tight-fitting collar around his neck, studded with spikes. With half of his head hair shaved off and the other half dyed neon-green, he certainly has a memorable look. 'Hey there, I'm Spike,' the canine says to you in a firm tone, clearly taking care not to sound too eager. 'With you being the boss around here, I got a proposition,' he adds and takes a pull from his cigarette, blowing a puff of smoke into the air after a short moment.";

I'm plenty tough and wanna see some action out there in the city, not just a few blocks around the lair. Come on, if you agree, the queen bitch in the library can't tell me off no more.' His last comment, combined with the young man's physical appearance finally makes something click in your mind, and you realize with a start who and what he is. You are talking with Alexandra's missing puppy, who clearly had a bit of a growth spurt since running off recently, turning into this young man. From the looks of it, he's inherited a lot of the 'bad dog' attitude of his mother, and has decided to make a name for himself in a typical 'young tough guy' fashion - by becoming a hanger-on for the biggest, baddest person he knows: You.

After all, you were the one who tamed the tough bitch that is my mom and brought her to the library. She had me and the others not much later. Living with all of them as a pack wasn't half-bad at first either. You should have seen the things that we did together! There are some corners in the library that... ah, but that's old news. Anyways, mom kept treating me like a pup even when I grew up. Hell, I was fully grown for days and she still lumped me in with the others. Got pretty annoyed with that shit, fast, so I started exploring the surrounding city blocks on my own. Anything to get out from under her paw a bit, you know?' Patting the leg of his ripped jeans and tugging on his skin-tight mesh shirt, the anthro Doberman proudly explains that he found them scavenging.";
	say "     Then Spike goes on to grab his crotch, adjusting the penis-shaped bulge in it and says, 'After what happened next, I knew that I didn't just want to go back and spend all of my time cooped up in the library. Following the most amazing scent, I went down the street and into an alley, and there I met a bitch! Oh yeah, let me tell you, that husky slut was just asking for it. Totally in heat and ready to rub up against me from the first moment our eyes met. Damn, I still can't believe how good it felt to sink my bone into her, to take that needy bitch!' Now your canine companion is openly rubbing his dick through the fabric of his pants, caught up in the memory of losing his virginity. 'Well, I fucked her good! Tied with her and stayed on top till I had bred that pussy to the brim!'";

'When I got back home mom was angry about me just going off on my own and wanted to know what I had been doing. I told her exactly [italic type]whom[roman type] I had been doing, and that I was an adult now. That stupid bitch just laughed!' Intentionally raising his voice to sound a bit more like Alexandra, Spike says in a biting tone, 'Just because you got your dick wet doesn't mean that you're a man.'

The top bitch of the library, if you ask her, and someone I should apparently listen to and obey. Oh, don't misunderstand me, she was pretty nice to have as a mom when I was a pup, but definitely less so later.' Grumbling, Spike makes a fist, followed by a throwing-away gesture. 'It's just unfair, you know? I know a bit of how she thinks, ever since I was little and drank it up with her milk. Part of mom felt freed when she became your bad bitch; unrestrained in her lusts and desires, allowing herself to let stupid morality [italic type]go for good[roman type]. Hell, I grew up knowing just how much you can accomplish if you're powerful and ruthless enough. How was I supposed to stay her sweet little cub forever? Fuck that! I wanna get some action too!'";

to say SpikeTalk5: [military]
	say "     Bringing up the topic of the military and their presence in the city draws little attention from Spike. Only when you keep looking at him, one eyebrow raised as you wait for a reply does the young Doberman say, 'Um, what about them? Isn't it some sort of loser gang or something? I got some inherited memories from mom and she thought they are supposed to be a big deal, but I've got my doubts. From what I've seen out in the city, lots of those soldiers got taken as sluts and breeding bitches by all sorts of creatures. Pretty weak and pathetic in my book.' Shrugging and putting aside all thought on the military, Spike clears his throat and adds, 'Now if you want a group that truly has to be reckoned with, just look at the hyenas. They're strong, take what they wand and no one fucks around with them, that's for sure!'";

I know how to take care of myself and won't take up any of your supplies at all. There are lots of places where one can scavenge for good stuff and even if you don't find anything yourself, someone else out on the streets will have. Most of the time you just gotta wait till they start rutting with someone or something, then make off with the food. And if they wise up and try to stop me - I'm plenty tough enough to rough up someone who wants a beating.'";

to say SpikeTalk7: [transformation]
	say "     Bringing up the topic of transformations with Spike, he looks a bit puzzled at you and scratches the back of his neck. 'Hm, I never really thought about how they really work to be honest. I mean - I've seen that shit go down, mostly after someone got the snot beaten out of them. When they're all beaten down and don't even struggle anymore, see? The winner gets on top, humps the poor bitch or dude and poof, there's two of the critters in the street. But that's not really what you're after, is it? Just giving in, pfft!' Rolling his eyes and making a throwing-away gesture, he discards the idea as ridiculous[if Libido of Spike > 40 and Libido of Spike < 61]which makes you chuckle internally, as that's exactly what you have him doing when you forcefully push him into sex[end if]. Then suddenly, the young Doberman taps the side of his muzzle and gets an excited look on his face. 'You know, the way to become something else, on purpose and all, might be to... err, invite it in? Let down your guard and really want it.'";
	say "     Spike frowns at his last sentence, seemingly thinking it sounded rather lame, so he raises his hands in a 'hold on' gesture and rushes ahead to say, 'Just wait and listen! See, I went and had a bit of fun with this husky bitch a little while ago, and you know, totally got her where she wanted to go. As I pulled out after, I could really see the brown fur spreading through her coat! Shy must have been so happy to get a proper dobie boning that she just wanted to be one herself, eh?' Your young companion chuckles and moves as if to nudge you with an elbow, only to falter as he sees your unconvinced expression. 'Wait, wait, wait! I got another example! There was this dude, a... well, something. Armor plates and a tail, slitted eyes, long trenchcoat. Kinda followed him a bit because he looked like he had some profitable racket going. Knocking on doors, whispering with people inside and trading stuff through the crack. Only it wasn't pills or drugs or anything. Just bits of fur with rubber bands around em!'";

That's why I know it was just some worthless hair. Bit of a disappointment there, but when I threw it aside, he jumped for it. Thinking back, that guy might have wanted to have a certain shape and wanted the hair for that, eh?' Spike is clearly somewhat embarrassed about his abortive attempt of robbery, but he might have the right idea about the fur and all that. You tell him as much, making him smile about having figured out something. 'So! Uhm, do you want to try, maybe?

Pulling out one of the empty plastic bottles that you collected sometime during your travels, you hand it to the young man, then casually step around him and wrap your arms around his chest from behind. 'Oh? Oooh,' the slender canine pants as your hands move to touch his chest, stroking and caressing his nipples through the thinly stretched material of his mesh shirt. Nuzzling the side of his neck, you take a whiff of his fresh but still masculine scent.

You continue to caress and fondle the dobie for a little while, often stroking the straight edge of his ears and whispering in them what a good boy and good dog he is for you. Given the stimulation, there's little wonder that the front of his pants are soon tented, and you eventually move on to obtaining what you want, popping the button and then pulling down the zipper of Spike's jeans. Craning your neck to look around him, your gaze falls on the pointy head of his red knotted cock, sticking out straight from his crotch. Your canine companion's tongue lolls out of his mouth as he pants in lust and his body tenses when you reach for his erection, wrapping your fingers around its hot shaft.";

His hand on your side is simply holding on now, though it gives you a squeeze or two at times when your strokes really hit the mark. Wanting to make this more than just milking him for some seed as quickly as possible, you keep caressing Spike, at times slowing down to squeeze his pre-knot bulge and tracing your fingertips along the outside of his tapering dickhead. With him breathing harder and harder, starting to hump into your grasp subconsciously, you know that he's getting close and remind the young Doberman that he must be ready to catch his load. 'Yeah, totally,' he grunts, not really registering your words.";

Yeah, sure thing, [SpikePlayerAddress],' he replies a little sheepishly, taking off the cap of the bottle you gave him and holding it ready to catch his impending spurts of canine seed. Giving his shaft a slow stroke up and down, you tell him that you're very proud of him, turning into such a strong and reliable companion for you, ready to do anything you ask of him. The praise makes Spike stand a bit straighter as he soaks it up, and that is the moment you start going all out, really jerking his manhood with no holds barred. Between getting the approval that he craves and the build-up of physical pleasure you've been giving him so far, it isn't hard at all to push the young male over the edge.";

Still, being the good boy that he is, your dobie does manage the task and the first thick blast of his cum shoots straight into the container, hitting the lower end with a quiet thud, followed by another and another.

His erection just keeps spurting out more cum, not as explosively as the first blasts, but still far longer than any human male would have lasted. Glancing down and seeing that he filled about the lower third of the small plastic bottle you gave him, you can't help but wonder if your tight grip on his knot has something to do with it. Maybe his body is trying to make sure he fills his bitch up? No matter which, your little milking fun with the Doberman is a roaring success, as it put your companion in an amazing mood and he produced a respectable dose of creamy fluid.

'Okay then, anything for you [SpikePlayerAddress]. Just give me a moment alone, alright?' With that said, he accepts a bottle from you and vanishes into a quiet corner, tail wagging behind his back. The young dobie gets busy stroking himself right quick, so it doesn't take all that long before he returns, with the bottle capped and containing his 'donation' as per your request.

'No, I - I thought...' the young man starts, but seeing the unimpressed sneer that this brings to your face, he falls silent again. Without another word, he quietly undoes the button and zipper of his pants, pushing them down to start rubbing his sheath and tease out the length of his manhood. Nervously glancing up at you from having his head lowered, he gets himself fully hard before much longer.";

You can't help but smile at the control you have over the young man, reveling in your power while he milks himself dutifully. The strokes along his knotted length come faster and faster before long, and he lets out a grunt, then starts to blast his seed into the bottle. Throb after throb of rich canine spunk lands in the plastic container, filling about the lower third of the small bottle before his orgasm ebbs off.

Telling him harshly that you want his dick, you leave the dobie standing with a perplexed look on his face as you sink down into a crotch right before him. With a grin on your face, you pop the button of his jeans, then wrench them down over the tight curve of his ass, baring the young man's body down to the knees. 'What the - nnnghh!' he gasps out as you cup his furry balls with one hand, giving them a noticeable squeeze and rolling the sensitive orbs between your fingers.

You can feel some trembling of his hips from the anthro's tail wagging on its own despite anything he can do and find yourself chuckling at the conflicting emotions you must be giving your play-pet. It's certainly fun to have a sexy doggy to do whatever you want with. Leaning forward and giving his tip a lick draws a pleased gasp from the Doberman, followed by a huff as he forces himself to close his open muzzle and starts to breathe through his nose, trying so very hard not to show his youth and relative inexperience. The young man's eyes clench shut tightly, most likely from him imagining being somewhere else right now.

'Fucking hell,' he gasps out loud, any attempt of controlling himself quickly forgotten in view of your teasing and stroking. You can't be quite sure about it, but you feel as if the volume of his pre-spurts is increasing as you push the young man's arousal to higher and higher levels.

Fuccckkk, you bastard! Nnnghh, so close!' As he gets loud, you squeeze his balls a little and rub them between your fingers, which is enough to give Alexandra's offspring the final push.

Leaning into your embrace with his tail wagging eagerly, the cute canine wakes the desire in you to kiss him again, which you do after pulling his muzzle to your face.

Eyes full of lust and hero worship, Spike nods in assent without even a second of further hesitation. His hands move towards his hips, then pull at his belt, soon undoing its clasp with eager haste. Then the Doberman just shoves his jeans down, followed by kicking them off to the side. Standing before you, naked from the waist down, you can see that he's also hard and erect, his red rocket having a glistening drop of pre at its very tip.

Unwilling to wait even a second longer, you make quick work of stripping down yourself, then step over the little pile of your discarded gear to draw Spike against you. His short fur feels soft and warm against your skin as you enfold him in a tight embrace and share a fun little bit of groping with each other, culminating in a request for him to get on the ground. Spike lets go after another moment or two, then crouches down and braces himself with one arm as he sits on the floor and lays back. You join him just a moment later, coming to kneel between the toned legs of the anthro canine.";

His innocent vulnerability makes your lust spike and you lay a hand possessively on his chest as you say that you take very good care of your partners. Gathering some spit, you let it drip off the tip of your tongue to land on your [Cock of Player] erection, stroking the shaft to spread the improvised lube. After that, you reach down to lift Spike's legs and put them in a nice spread-open position before telling tell him to take over from you.

Meeting his eyes, you jokingly tell him that there's much more to come than just an inch or two, if he will only release your dick. Shame-faced in his inexperience, Spike sputters for a second or two, then replies, 'Oh! Er- yeah, I'll do that then.' He pants audibly and forces his clenched fists to relax, soon placing both hands on the ground, fingers outstretched.

Eager as the dobie is, he readily takes your advice on when to flex his inner muscles, squeezing and milking your cock inside his ass. At the same time, his own knotted cock stands proudly erect from all the anal stimulation, swaying back and forth with the continued thrusts into him.

Clearly, your doggie boy is enjoying the wild ride he's getting. A grin spreads over your lips as you look him in the eye and tell Spike that he's your special little friend now, a real man you can trust with anything, and to underline your words, you take hold of his cock and start jerking the young man. Aligning your hand movements with the thrusts of your cock, you tell him how good his ass feels around you. Getting physical pleasure at the same time as the acknowledgement he so clearly craves pushes Spike to the next level, whimpering like a bitch in heat as he gives himself to you fully and with all his self.";

And as your balls touch his ass this time, the over-sexed young man finally is at the end of his endurance: Barking out unintelligible sounds of pleasure, Spike thrashes under you and his cock starts to erupt with cum that splatters his heaving chest in long streaks. His inner muscles quiver and clench at the same time as the rest of the anthro male, creating the sensation of being jerked off inside his hole, which pushes you over the edge right along with him. Groaning loudly, you grind against his ass and erupt into his innermost depths, laying claim to the athletic canine by breeding his ass thoroughly.";

It almost seems like he wants to make sure that your praise before wasn't just a heat of the moment thing, being still unsure about his self-worth. Looking down at the young man, sweaty and stretched out on the ground before you, his cum splattered over his own chest, you grin and reply that he's a proper little stud with an amazingly tight hole, just the man you want by your side. The anthro dobie beams happily as you pat his chest and go on a little about how nice it felt when he flexed around you, then lean in and plant a kiss on his muzzle.

He walks to where his mesh shirt is lying on the ground and winces as he tries to bend over to pick it up, so you step in and take it, then pull it over his head, helping your companion to get dressed. As Spike tucks the cloth into place, you proceed to affectionately rub the back of his neck and then his cheek, finally thanking him for letting you make him your special friend and giving his ass up to you. 'I figured you were right about being a team as we make this city ours, so why not become your butt-brother, hah! Much more fun than a blood oath for sure!'

Spike's eyebrows rise a little at the lewd undertone of your voice, then asks, 'Uhm, so what do you want to do, [SpikePlayerAddress]?' With a chuckle, you reply that he should push down his pants. There is a tiny moment of hesitation before Spike reacts, moving to comply quickly afterwards and undoing his button and zipper before pushing the jeans down over the firm curve of his ass. This bares the anthro dobie's relatively slender hips and his crotch, revealing a furry pair of balls and canine sheath.";

The young Doberman visibly swallows as he realizes that accepting you as his boss means that he'll have to follow all of your commands, no matter what he may think of them. Thankfully, he still remembers the speech you gave him before, so this time all it takes is clearing your throat for him to submit and start moving to follow orders. Pulling his paws out of the bunched-up pants around his ankles, the young man folds them and lays down the package to kneel on.

As you get into position behind Spike, you take note of the fact that his tail is tucked down between his buttocks in a subconscious sign of discomfort, even though he might have relented to your demands. This makes you soften your approach at least a little bit, not wanting to scar your fun little boy-toy too much after all. Placing your hands on his buttocks, you give the dobie some firm but gentle caresses, then slide them underneath and feel for his sheath.";

Wrapping your fingers around the canine's shaft, you let your other hand roam further up, feeling his chest and playing with the young man's nipples. Bent over him as you are, it isn't too hard to move your head next to his pointy ear and whisper into them that he seems to like being your obedient doggy after all, underlining the words with caresses and more stroking. 'Yes, [SpikePlayerAddress],' Spike pants out in a fairly submissive tone, with little of his earlier reluctance remaining now that you've gotten him aroused and more ready for actual fun.

Dipping two fingers into the small handful of slick fluid milked from your boy-toy, you brush your digits over his hole teasingly, circling around and around mixed with little almost-pushes. When you eventually slip him your middle finger, it is a sudden move, putting you knuckle deep before he can even realize that this isn't another feint at penetration. 'Nnnghh, fuck!' Spike groans as his hole tightens into a death-grip around your digit and you don't try to move it, just letting him get used to the feeling.";

This allows you to push your index-finger in too in another surprise move, starting to stretch and open your bottom in training slowly but surely as you soon begin working them in and out of him. It still takes a fair bit patience and a few gobs of spit to lube his entrance well enough, but eventually you feel that he's ready for your cock. Spike inhales a gasping breath as you tell him this with a grin on your face, and after a little coaching, you get him to call out, 'Fuck me [SpikePlayerAddress], I- I need to feel you inside me.'

After a little while of just resting inside him and letting Spike get used to being your cock-sleeve, you start pulling back, drawing more moans and pants from him as you slide against his inner walls, followed by another slow push inside. Working up to sawing your dick in and out of the young man, you slowly increase the tempo and are soon playfully timing your thrusts with his moans of pleasure, hammering into Spike as he is just breathing out and making him go light-headed as you drive the last remaining air from his lungs.";

With a whorish moan that would fit a needy bitch in heat, the dobie takes everything you can dish out and even raises his ass higher, presenting himself for deeper penetration. With all stops falling by the wayside, you use him as you see fit in a wild rush of hard fucking, stoking the fires of your lust ever higher. Then suddenly, there is an animalistic howl of pleasure as Spike starts to tremble and trash underneath you, his fuckhole clenching tight around your cock as his own knotted manhood starts to blast out sticky strings of cum.";

Spike's inner muscles keep flexing while you both are coming, literally milking more seed out of you and prolonging the orgasm quite nicely. By the time your further spurts of cum eventually ebb off, the both of you are quite exhausted and you sink down to rest on your partner's back to rest for a little while, which makes his trembling arms buckle and lands the two of you sprawled on the ground, still connected by your erection and with your arms loosely wrapped around his chest.

The young man reaches behind himself hesitantly, then feels around with a light touch, apparently checking the state of his freshly de-virginized hole. 'Man, you really did a number on my ass. I don't think I'll be sitting down anytime soon,' he says with a wince, then gulps a little as he sees your answering grin that promises more pounding in the future. You don't feel a need to comment any more than that, simply lying back in relaxation as you watch him get up slowly, then curse a little as he realizes that part of his load soaked into the jeans he was kneeling on.

'God, that stings!' he groans against the ground, which you answer with another bit of spanking, telling him that you want him to stay in this position and keep down the whining. After a few more hits to drive your point home, you ask Spike if he understands, and the young man gives a pained nod.

The tension between the Doberman and yourself rises as you plant your hands on his hips and take a tight grip, followed by a brutal thrust into his tight hole. As tight and clenched as he may be, the young man's pucker is no match against your steel-hard rod, plunging into him like a hot knife into butter. There just is no way he could keep quiet through this, and a hoarse scream leaves Spike's lips as you take his virginity from him by force.";

Slapping his buttocks once more and railing at him about relaxing his muscles, you thrust in and out in an unrelenting tempo. Grim amusement plays over your lips as you watch his skin clinging tightly to your cock on each pull out, followed by the next push inside that draws another gasp from your helpless partner. Breaking him in like this forces your boy-toy to learn the ropes quickly unless he wants his ass torn up, and so far Spike's doing a fairly nice job of it, with only one or two painful mistakes in which he didn't loosen his muscles quickly enough.";

Squeezing his erection sharply, you laugh and comment that it can't be too bad if he's hard from being fucked, then demand for him to beg you for more sex. You do indeed get that, as Spike gasps out between groans, 'Fuck me! Take me [SpikePlayerAddress]! *Nnnnghhhh* Fuck my ass!' Going back to harsh thrusts with your hands on his hips after that, you rail your little bitch-boy good, hammering into him faster and faster until you can barely contain your lust anymore.

With a chuckle, you reply that he should strip and assume his position. The one on all fours, like a good little bitch so he can help you let off some steam. There is a tiny moment of hesitation before Spike reacts, moving to comply quickly afterwards and undoing his button and zipper before pushing the jeans down over the firm curve of his ass.

Placing your hands on his buttocks, you give the dobie some firm but gentle caresses, then slide them underneath and feel for his sheath.

Dipping two fingers into the small handful of slick fluid milked from your boy-toy, you brush your digits over his opening teasingly, circling around and around mixed with little almost-pushes. When you eventually slip him your middle finger, it is a sudden move, putting you knuckle deep before he can even realize that this isn't another feint at penetration. 'Nnnghh, fuck!'

Thankfully, his body seems to remember being broken in by your erection, opening up to flex much more readily than the first time you took Spike. After adding some more spit and fingering his insides, you feel that he's ready for your cock. Spike inhales a gasping breath as you tell him this with a grin on your face, and he even remembers the line you taught him, calling out, 'Fuck me [SpikePlayerAddress], I- I need to feel you inside me.'

With a whorish moan that would fit a needy bitch in heat, the dobie takes everything you can dish out and even raises his ass higher, presenting himself for deeper penetration. With all stops falling by the wayside, you use him as you see fit in a wild rush of hard fucking, stoking the fires of your lust ever higher.

Spike's inner muscles keep flexing while you both are coming, literally milking more seed out of you and prolonging the orgasm quite nicely. By the time your further spurts of cum eventually ebb off, the both of you are quite exhausted and you sink down to rest on your partner's back to rest for a little while, which makes his trembling arms buckle and lands the two of you sprawled on the ground, still connected by your erection and with your arms loosely wrapped around his chest.

The young man reaches behind himself hesitantly, then feels around with a light touch, apparently checking the state of his well-bred hole. 'I'm still weirded out by this. Hurt like a bitch the first time, but now it's adapted to take dick or some shit like that,' he says with a wince, then gulps a little as he sees you nodding and giving an answering grin that promises more pounding in the future. You don't feel a need to comment any more than that, simply lying back in relaxation as you watch him get up slowly, then curse a little as he realizes that part of his load soaked into the jeans he was kneeling on.

Slapping his buttocks once more and railing at him about relaxing his muscles, you thrust in and out in an unrelenting tempo. Grim amusement plays over your lips as you watch his skin clinging tightly to your cock on each pull out, followed by the next push inside that draws another gasp from your helpless partner. Forcing your boy-toy to better relax his muscles quickly unless he wants his ass torn up, Spike's doing a fairly nice job of it.

The piece of gear lies on the ground, the painted side down, and its surface shining in the rich brown of some tropical hardwood. Holding a bottle of olive oil in his paw, the anthro jaguar pours a little of its content carefully on the wood, then rubs it in with a rag, already pretty soaked in oil. You feel almost entranced as you watch the warrior maintain his tool. His determined, circling movements, intent on leaving no spot on the shield uncoated, and keeping the wood supple and strong, have you thinking: albeit he agreed to become your 'war-slave' and pet, Tehuantl remains a proud, dutiful, and dependable man.";

You direct your steps to the row of windows overlooking the street next, taking the time to glance up and down the road and across it, following the T-intersection to look at the stores further west. Everything seems quiet for the moment, with only the scattered shreds of clothing on the road and a burned-out car to remind you that the nanite apocalypse is going on right now. 'So, uhm... hello there. I'm Spike,' you hear your dobie companion say a little distance away, and as you look around you see that he's addressing Tehuantl. The jaguarman calmly finishes another stroke of the oily cloth over his shield, making sure he creates a nice and even sheen before he sets it down against the wall and stands up. Green, feline eyes wander over the dobie as he takes in Spike from head to toe next, the slow waving of his tail from side to side [if MaxHP of Spike is 1]leading over into it stiffening at attention when Tehuantl's nostrils flare a little[else]betraying his interest[end if].";

Letting out a breath that he didn't quite realize he held, Spike offers the other man a hand, his tail starting a careful wag behind his back. The jaguar warrior immediately moves to grab his forearm, giving it a firm squeeze that Spike returns in kind as he catches up with the foreign gesture of greeting. Looking at the two of them from where you're standing at the window, you see that Spike is just a little bit taller than the other man, especially with the sharp wedges of his upright ears and the shock of neon-green hair on his head. At the same time, he's somewhat less muscular too, and you can see a definite difference in their posture.";
			say "     While the dobie and jaguar both look young and fit with an apparent similar physical age, it is immediately apparent that Tehuantl is much more experienced and self-reliant. He holds Spike in their forearm handshake [if MaxHP of Spike is 1]for a few seconds more[else]for a fleeting moment[end if], then releases the grip with a little nod to the young canine, as if prompting him to speak. 'I - er, was wondering about you. You know, I'm the right-hand man of the boss and all. How do you fit into the organization, and all that?' Spike says to Tehuantl, steeling his voice after a little bit of a rocky start and squaring his shoulders. There is a [if MaxHP of Spike is 1]hint of a chuckle[else]pitying snort[end if] from the jaguar warrior at Spike's attempt of posturing, quickly suppressed as Tehuantl replies in a dignified tone, 'The [master] took me as their war-slave in combat.

His tail twitches back and forth in agitation despite this, and he bites off saying something for a few seconds before he explains, [else]warrior's ears pull back and his tail twitches in agitation. Tehuantl calms himself, yet you can still hear in his voice that he's offended. [end if]'Honor demands that I serve! Without it, men are just beasts! Should we have continued to fight until there is a sea of blood like in the battle of Otumba instead?' Hastily, Spike raises his hands in a pacifying gesture and interjects, 'Wow, wow! Calm down. I didn't mean to say that it's bad or anything. Or that you're weird, you know. You kinda seem like a cool dude to be honest.' Taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out, Tehuantl relents and nods to him. 'I accept your apology, young [if MaxHP of Spike is 1]pup[else]warrior[end if]. And I see what must be done now.'";

Already on the way to pick up his shield, Tehuantl says over his shoulder, 'Training, of course! If you're to be [if MaxHP of Spike is 1]your [parent]'s [else][PosAdj of Player][end if]right hand, you need strength, cunning, and wisdom. I will instruct you appropriately. Come with me now.'

The jaguar warrior proudly counts up his companion's repetitions, or maybe he's directing them rather, as you notice that Tehuantl says the words just before Spike flexes. Not wanting to interrupt them, you do stay halfway out of sight behind a bookshelf for now, simply watching as the anthro feline soon counts up to fifty and gives a pleased churr.

This is long enough for the trained jaguar warrior to capitalize greatly on it, wrenching his other arm free and twisting his own body like an oiled snake. Somehow, he ends up sideways on Spike, his hips and midriff in contact with the young canine's chest, one leg pinning Spike's left arm, the right arm clamped down in an iron grip. 'Never relax your attention on the enemy unless you're absolutely certain you've won,' the spotted male advises sage-like while his student struggles afterwards, futilely tensing his arms, then trying to kick with his legs and raising into a bridge - which doesn't work, with Tehuantl lying on top of him.";

'Better take that off, you don't wanna get it sweaty, eh?' the orc adds, tugging at the mesh shirt on his trainee's chest.";

Then he gets down on the training mat and begins to do push-ups. Urik joins him a few seconds later, crouching down and looking at Spike closely. 'Gotta straighten your back more, puppy-boy! And really get on tip-toe with those paws, then go down till your puzzle is right over the ground!' He observes the Doberman's efforts with a critical eye for a little while, even reaching out to push down on his naked back to make him go lower. 'That's a little better, but you still don't have quite the right form. Here, tense up a bit back here!' Urik goes on to say, smacking his hand lightly on Spike's ass and giving it a quick grope. Besides a quick, 'Hey!' at Urik squeezing his ass, the Doberman takes his instruction without complaint and does his best to obey. After a few more repetitions, Urik gives him a grudging, 'Now keep that pose as you go up and down.'";

From time to time, he even does a few with just one arm as he reaches out to correct Spike again, his hand often staying to keep touching the Doberman for a few seconds. The two of them keep working out for some time, with Spike having to take breaks to catch his breath while Urik just powers through.

Still panting, Spike yips at suddenly being man-handled, glancing up at Urik. 'At least you've got the spunk to keep at it, boy. No complaining from you, or are you just to weak to get it out right now?' Groaning, Spike shakes his head left and right, then gasps, 'No! I - I'm good.'

It's Urik, and as Spike turns around to look at him, you notice a little wag of his tail. 'Hi Urik, what's up? Is it already time for our next training session?' The orc grins at him and nods. 'Yup, time to put you through your paces!' Urik adds, then throws a bottle of his 'protein shake' for Spike to catch. He waits for the young man to take a first swallow of the liquid, then brings forward his other hand, which had been balled to a loose fist by his side.

But... eh, did you find this on the street or something? Looks like the back half is missing.' Turning the garment around, Spike tugs at a pair of elastic bands as if to demonstrate what he means. 'Naw, that's how it's supposed to look. It's a sports thing, and this'll be good especially for you!' Urik replies with a smile and pats Spike's head. 'Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!' the young man replies somewhat annoyedly, patting away the large hand. 'Your tail, boy!

Spike looks at the much taller orc and says, 'Fine, but no peeking!' 'Wouldn't dream about it,' the orc replies, one hand casually behind his back with crossed fingers. Nodding, Spike walks past him, over to the sofa in the sitting area, where he strips down and starts to put on the jockstrap, taking a few seconds to figure out which way all the straps go. Meanwhile, Urik is watching over his shoulder, his gaze taking in the curve of the dobie's ass in detail.";

Urik replies, 'Let me see,' and reaches out to cup Spike's crotch, which the young man quickly deflects. 'Hey, keep your fingers to yourself. You can look, but no touching.' Grunting in amusement, the orc takes Spike by the shoulders and turns him around, looking at his hips. 'Seems alright to me, you won't have to worry about losing it as we run! Now finish off your shake and then we can get to some laps.' Spike does as requested, grabbing his bottle and chugging more of the rich mixture inside.

At first I did for a few steps, hell, that husky had offered me her pussy, but then I heard a noise from behind one of the dumpsters in there. When she noticed that I knew something was up, the bitch shouted, 'Get him, Bill!' and this dude jumped out from his hiding spot. Half human, half husky guy, with a long metal rod he was hefting like a spear!' Spike pauses for effect, miming a guy attacking him, then goes on to say, 'But I was too quick for the dude.

That didn't work out so well, as me and a bunch of other soldiers were passing by on our way to a bar, and we gave em a good thrashing. But yeah, gotta watch out for yourself.' He nods to Spike, who was listening intently to his tale, then glances down at his forearm, making a fist and stroking over the tattoo covering his skin there. 'I miss Dec, he was a swell dude. Good tattoo artist too, he gave me these back in [']84,' Urik says, then pauses for a moment before he adds, 'Not even a year later, he got shot in the back by some little punk with a souped-up ride and inflated ego.

Laughing out loud and slapping the side of his thigh, the orc grins at his trainee as he replies, 'I'm fifty-four years old, puppyboy! Don't look like it, do I, eh? If you ask me, this transformation business is the best thing that could have happened! Feel like I'm twenty again, and I'll take honest street-fighting over that rotten society from before any day. No more pigs who harass you just because you ride a bike. We sorted them out good, I can tell you that!'

Bike's in the shop - don't think I'm still regretting that decision - and I'm out with some buds drinking, go home, sleep the buzz off. Next morning, I'm woken up by some asshole screaming and banging on my door. Literally, as I stumbled out of the bedroom and what did I see? My mailwoman, face pressed against the window of the door, with a big-boobed fucking gryphon shafting her from behind! Kind of a shocker, early in the morning, and I wondered if I was still drunk and not just hung over, I can tell you that! Then she looked at me and called my name, and I knew it was real. I turn away for a moment to grab the shotgun and load it, but by the time I get back, it's two dick-swinging bird-babes on my porch, one of them in she shreds of a mail uniform. Hot, but freaky, so I booked it out the back door quick after that.'";

Thought I'd make it to our watering hole, see if I could link up with some of the guys, get out of dodge. That plan went overboard quick when suddenly a frightened piggy peeled around the street corner in front of me at a dead run, to bounce right off me when we collided. I stumbled back a few steps, he went down on the ground. Oh, what a sight he was - pretty blue uniform shirt ripped, with the dude's pecs hanging out, and he had a wild expression on his face, calling out to help him.' The orc chuckles at that, miming himself holding a shotgun and an exaggeratedly frightened expression for the cop. 'What came after him a second later was a beast!

My buddy Pete, with about three times the muscle that fat bastard had ever had before! The scared pig shouted for me to take him out, only to receive a bump on the head from Pete, who went on to tell me that being an orc is great. I was still doubtful for a while, but he knew shit, you know? Reminded me of the trip to Mexico we had the year before, and some shit no one else could have known. When I lowered the gun, he went ahead to casually rip the clothes of the stunned cop. Showed off his muscles and new body as he did, and a moment later rammed into him deep!'

I pounded the little bitch, hard and deep, churning up his cum-filled boipussy! And as I was doing so, I got to thinking 'Is he getting tighter?' But that wasn't it - my dick was growing, at the same time as my skin was going green! Man, I was so horny that I didn't even care! Just kept enjoying the snug hole around my prick, right until the point that I added some spunk to the bitch's chute! Then Pete went for him again, followed by another round for me!'";

Nah, the dude had become a proper little orc breeder! Pretty but muscular, with teeny tiny tusks. Not unlike those canines you have there.'

Before Spike can reply, the orc takes hold of his pants and pushes them down in a quick move, kicking them off a second later. He wraps his hand around the large pole of his cock and starts stroking slowly, nodding to Spike to do the same.";
		say "     There is a moment of hesitation as the slender Doberman seems torn between walking away and joining in for a side-by-side jerk-off session, before Spike's libido wins out and he pulls the front of his jockstrap aside to free the red rocket of his canine shaft. Seems like Urik hit the right tone with him, leaving Spike to choose and not reaching for his crotch himself. The two men beat off together, with Spike keeping his eyes closed and imagining something, while the orc feasts his eyes on the Doberman instead. Eager to get his rocks off, the anthro's rapid jerking brings him close to the edge fairly quickly, as is obvious by his loud panting and the his whole body tensing up. This is just what Urik was waiting for, reaching over to cup his hand over the pointy dickhead of his trainee. As the tip of a finger brushes against the edge of Spike's head, the young man opens his eyes and pants out, 'What are you doing?'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Would be a shame to let it go to waste - and a mess to clean up,' Urik replies, now bringing his hand even closer, so the dobie's cock is grinding against his palm while he caresses the tip of Spike's cock. The added stimulation is enough to drive the young man over the edge, letting out a lusty bark as he stiffens, balls throbbing as they send forth a thick spurt of cum to paint Urik's green skin white. Grinning broadly, the orc catches Spike's load, then brings his hand up to lick the sperm off it, watched by a wide-eyed Spike. 'Tasty!' he quips at the anthro dog, finishing off his snack with one last lick before moving on to jerking his own load into the same hand, with the sheer volume of his output threatening to overflow the cupped palm. 'It's good stuff, I love it!' the orc casually comments to his companion while his erection is still pulsing out more cum. 'You want some too?' comes the next question, with him raising the hand to offer it to Spike.";
		say "     The slender Doberman quickly takes a step back and shakes his head, replying, 'No thanks, I think I'm good.' At the same time, his nostrils are flaring as he sniffs the air and takes in the scent of Urik's seed - apparently enjoying it, as the tail behind his back wags a little. His face has a bit of an odd expression on it, as if he can't believe that he likes the aroma of orc cum. Meanwhile, Urik proceeds to eat his own load, hungrily gulping it down and sucking on his fingers to get the very last drops, then smacking his lips in satisfaction. 'I look forward to our next session. You go along now, I'll clean up here,' the orc tells Spike, who tucks his jockstrap back in place and then wanders off into his little man-cave.";

'Not the best outfit to do this one in I guess,' Urik comments with a grin before adding, 'Told ya you should have stripped down.'";
		say "     Spike glances up to meet the orc's eyes, his hands twitching towards the zipper of his tight jeans for a second before freezing halfway there. 'Wait a moment - no! I'm not gonna go bare-ass naked next to you! Hell, I can see your dick in those pants and it's already half-hard!' Looking down, Urik puts a hand on the long bulge of his rather tight stretch-fabric trunks, adjusting himself with a broad grin on his face. 'What? Feeling anxious puppyboy? Think you couldn't take it in your tiny hole? Not that I was planning anything anyways! I'm not supposed to 'force myself on anyone', remember?' The orc makes air-quotes as he says the words, complete with a little eye-roll. 'So, you got nothing to fear. Come on, do it! It's the proper capstone of the set and a great workout for the whole body!' Spike doesn't seem convinced by his words, instead shaking his head. 'I think not. Rather gonna call it a day now.' Blowing out his breath, Urik says, 'Your loss,' then goes back to his stretch and ignores Spike as he walks off.";

The big orc is busy playing a little game with himself, which is bouncing tennis balls off the top of the shelves below, timed just right so they bounce across several of the tall stacks. While you're still forming possible comments in your head, like where he got a shopping bag full of tennis balls and if Urik will clean up afterwards, a voice calls out from the side and interrupts your train of thought. Glancing over, you see that it's Spike who shouted, 'Hey Urik!' and the young Doberman is now approaching on his lithe paws. 'What? Did you feel an irresistible urge to run after these?' the orc replies with a grin on his face, throwing one of the yellow balls in the air and catching it, then casually flinging the tennis ball over the railing to fall between the rows of bookshelves.";
	say "     Spike finds himself following the ball with his gaze, indeed staring after it for a second before shaking off the impulse to get the tennis ball.

A broad smile appears on Urik's face and he reaches out to tousle the young anthro's green hair, with Spike batting at his hand to get him to stop. 'Is that so? Looks like the training is working then! I mean - your body's building mass now, and it needs a bunch of fuel for that of course. Come on, let's get to it then!' Cheerfully, the orc gives Spike's arm a 'light' slap that has him stumbling sideways for a second, then walks towards the back of the sitting area and retrieves a plastic bottle from the top of a quite tall shelf. Having followed his trainer, Spike accepts the drink from Urik, immediately opening it and taking a deep swig of the thick fluid.";

Weights and all, the orc carries it over to Spike, placing the whole thing down over a training mat spread on the floor. Meanwhile, the anthro Doberman can't seem to get enough of his shake, apparently lost to the world as he drinks it with greedy swallows. Only when the whole contents of the bottle are gone and Urik is done with the setup does Spike pay attention to his surroundings again, licking the sides of his muzzle as he looks around. 'Man, this time it's really got a kick! I feel like I could juggle with those weights in a moment! Did you change the formula or something?' Urik chuckles at the question, then smiles and explains: 'Told ya, you need the proper stuff to build muscles. That includes an upped dose of liquid protein for you! Okay then, puppyboy - get on the mat!'";
		say "     Tail wagging happily behind his back, Spike pulls his mesh shirt over his head in a swift move, throwing it aside, then proceeds to undo the button and zipper of his jeans. An eye-blink later, he's pushing them down and bending over to free his paws from the bunched-up fabric, quite oblivious to the fact that he's giving Urik a show with his bare ass. You can see the bulge in the orc's stretchy trunks grow visibly as his dick hardens partially, with Urik quickly adjusting it to keep his cock mostly tucked away. Meanwhile Spike lays down on the mat and lay his paws against the bar of the weights, waiting patiently for Urik to step over him to be his spotter. The orc stands ready to catch the weights just in case, and gives his trainee numerous bits of good advice as he goes through training. It is clear that he enjoys teaching Spike quite a bit.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     As some time passes and Spike works up a good sweat, you as well as Urik notice something - the young dobie's jockstrap is bulged out strongly, its tent betraying the fact that Spike has got an erection. Thinking to yourself that this must be a side effect of Urik's 'new formula', you watch a smile cross the orc's face, who helps Spike put the weight bar on its rack right after, then hands his trainee some lighter dumbbells that he can hold on one hand each. 'Give me at least fifty lifts with each arm!' Urik grunts as a challenge to the anthro Doberman and counts the first five aloud with Spike's movements before he starts to walk around him. Soon arriving next to the stretched-out form of Spike, Urik then crouches down and says loudly, 'Keep going, no matter what! I don't want to see you put down those weights until you're done with your set!' Between his pants, Spike's reply isn't so much words but rather a compliant grunt, and he puts in a new burst of energy to his lifting.";
		say "     'Good boy,' Urik comments with a smile, then adds, 'But we got to fix your pose a little too. Here, bend your knees and brace those paws against the mat.' As he says this, the large orc puts a big green hand on Spike's thigh, squeezing it before sliding his fingers underneath and guiding Spike into a new position with his legs. The dobie is very focused on lifting the weights again and again, so he doesn't really register that Urik touches him quite a bit more than needed, running his fingers up and down the young man's furred thighs and feeling them up. Only when the orc then lays a hand on his bare chest does Spike look over to meet his gaze, panting between lifts, 'What - are you - doing?' 'Just checking your progress. Feels like you've already built a little muscle mass here,' Urik says nonchalantly, covering Spike's left pec with his hand and brushing the side of his thumb over the dobie's nipple.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Just keep lifting,' the orc tells his trainee, meanwhile letting his fingers wander down over Spike's naked chest. Soon, he reaches the quite visible tent in the jockstrap covering Spike's crotch and bumps it with the side of his hand, just as the dumbbells are at their highest. 'But what do we have here? Someone's getting excited for their workouts, eh?' Spike glances down, his eyes widening, yet he can't say anything, panting from holding heavy weights lifted in the air right now. Then Urik's other hand is laid on his chest, holding him down with a gentle but firm push as the orc says, 'Don't fret, that happens to many who get really pumped by their training. Actually, why don't we add it to the workout?' With that said, he pulls the fabric of the jockstrap down, hooking it underneath Spike's erection. With the red rocket of his canine cock now standing proud and erect in full view, Urik wraps his fingers around it and starts to stroke him. Slowly, one stroke for each push with the weights.";
		say "     With his big, green-skinned personal trainer to motivate him, both with words as well as a very personal touch, the Doberman actually manages to complete the workout, even though he's more than a little tired, and very aroused by the end. As the dumbbells land on the ground with a thud, Urik says with a broad grin, 'And now you'll get your reward!' Taking out all the stops to really jerk Spike off with rapid hand movements, it takes just a few moments before the panting and exhausted canine gasps and thrusts his hips reflexively against the orc's hand. With a quick move, Urik cups his hand over the top of the throbbing shaft, stopping Spike's blasts of cum from making a mess of anything more than his palm. Grinning broadly, the orc then brings his hand up to lick the sperm off it, watched by a wide-eyed Spike. 'Tasty!' he quips at the anthro dog, finishing off his snack with one last lick.";

Cool your jets and have a look. You should be thankful when I go out of my way and grab equipment just for you!' Spike is still fairly shaken up by the surprise, but does react to the prompting from the orc by crouching down and pulling open the zipper on one of the bags. He raises his eyebrows at what he finds, then reaches in to lift a metal disc with a hole in the middle from it. Looks like part of an adjustable weightlifting set.

Next morning, I'm woken up by some asshole screaming and banging on my door. Literally, as I stumbled out of the bedroom and what did I see? My mailwoman, face pressed against the window of the door, with a big-boobed fucking gryphon shafting her from behind! Kind of a shocker, early in the morning, and I wondered if I was still drunk and not just hung over, I can tell you that! Then she looked at me and called my name, and I knew it was real.

Well, you gotta blame my nephew Troy for it. The little shit kept going 'Uncle, it's good for you!' and he eventually talked me into trying it out. And it worked, gotta admit that.' Shrugging his very wide, muscled shoulders, the orc adds, 'Thank god I'm no longer an old fart with aching joints, but Yoga's still good stuff.'";

And do I look like a little white-bearded man to you?' Putting on a challenging smirk on his muzzle, the dobie replies, 'Well, weren't you, old man? Half a century more white hair than I have!' Their eyes meet in a stare-down, with a silly grin growing on Spike's face before too long, then a chuckle bursting out of him. Urik raises an eyebrow at that, then snorts and adds while patting Spike's head, 'Got a point at that I guess, puppy-boy. Nah, just use my name, this isn't some mystic mountain martial arts training!' Stepping over to place his broad green feet on the end of an extra large exercise mat, Urik nods over to the second one beside his and says, 'Okay, take your place. And you wanna strip down, this stuff may look soft, but you'll get sweaty, that's for sure!' Finishing off his energy drink, Spike peels the tight mesh shirt off his body, throwing it in the direction of his man-cave to land in a wadded-up heap just a few steps short. As he then starts to walk past the large orc, Urik holds out his hand in front of the young man and clears his throat with a nod down to his hips.";

Urik tells his trainee, both for obeying as well as the fact that he's wearing the orc's earlier gift, a black jockstrap with red borders. In response to the praise, Spike's tail starts to wag. The dobie realizes this and pushes the appendage down with one hand, clamping it down as he throws Urik a look of youthful rebelliousness. 'I'm a badass, not a puppy! Remember that! And no staring at my ass!' Urik doesn't reward him with a reply, simply snorting and then going on to say, 'Okay, now stand like this and take a deep breath. Then...' the orc begins his instructions of Spike, taking him through basic breathing and pose exercises before demonstrating several poses himself and then watching the anthro Doberman attempt them. He keeps up his usual banter and teasing throughout the training set, but at the same time seems genuinely pleased in working out with his canine friend, throwing in praise and a few touches and squeezes of Spike's shoulder.";

The orc's large, green-skinned body glistens in the light, making watching him move quite a nice show. Beside him, Spike's panting a lot more than usual, his tongue dangling halfway out of his mouth and you can see that the short fur all over his body is matted against his skin. His anthro heritage shows through that, as you're fairly sure that real dogs don't have any sweat glands on their body. 'Feels good to work out all them muscles, eh mister badass?' the orc asks with a grin on his face, letting his eyes roam up and down over the young man's slender form. ";

Not going into any more detail before, Urik takes Spike through the steps of setting his paws on the mat in their proper places, breathing in and out, followed by the words, 'And now you bend forward, putting your hands on the ground and lower your head between them.' He proceeds to demonstrate the pose with practiced ease, followed by standing up and watching Spike attempt the same with somewhat less than optimal results.

Spike tenses for a second at the touch, but he lightens the mood by quipping, 'I knew you just wanted to get your hands on my ass, old man! Help, I'm being assaulted by a pervert!' Urik snorts, 'Smartass, just stick your rear out properly for the pose!'

Eager to get his rocks off, the anthro's rapid jerking brings him close to the edge fairly quickly, as is obvious by his loud panting and the his whole body tensing up.

Or does it have to go in the other end? And what's so special about orc cum?' the dobie asks next, curiosity audible in his voice. Urik nods down at his own cock, hanging limply on top of his large balls. A smirk grows on his face as he cups his balls and says, 'Okay, grasshopper - let's teach you the 101 of orc cum. You see, orcs don't need weapons. We got all we need down here!'";

Spike raises an eyebrow and throws in a comment of, 'If you say so. Don't think it's for me. Tasted my own, but it was nothing that made me go crazy for it. Or is it different for an orc breeder?'

Different taste and all that, especially if it's coming from a hot dude.' As he says this, the orc's gaze drops to Spike's crotch and an almost longing expression crosses his face.

Apparently he can't help but react to the compliment, as his dick gives a little twitch in its sheath. 'Uhm, if you wanna... taste me, I could, ...' he starts, with Urik not even waiting before he says a breathy, 'Yeah!'

At the same time, Urik watches him, taking in the naked canine, one hand resting on his own green leg, ready to catch Spike's cum when the time comes. As the dobie goes at it with full speed, not holding back and just wanting to get off, he fills the room with moans and grunts, as well as panted out words to go with his fantasy, like, 'Take it, slut! Yeah, you bitch, feel my dick!' It doesn't take all that long before he humps his hips reflexively and stiffens, moaning as the first spurt shoots out, right into Urik's quickly interposed palm, with the orc's fingers barely an inch above Spike's abs.

Spike sputters out, looking wide-eyed at Urik, who turns his white-streaked face to look at him. As their eyes meet, both of them burst out into laughter, followed by a grinning Urik wiping the cum off his face and sucking it off his fingers. 'Tasty!' he quips at the anthro dog after finishing off his snack, then smacking his lips in satisfaction.

Scene Ideas:

Spike goes for Candy and the raccoon throws himself at himself

Spike gets to know Regular Chris (friendship)

[ Idea for Start of Romance Path: ]
[ Event where Alexandra berates Spike for leaving her pack and running around outside with the player, some shouting, her eventually going "So you think you mean anything to <player> other than being a fuckhole? Dream on boy!" - player then being able to just stay out of it, defend Spike and say that he's a good right hand man, or draw him close and kiss him, saying that he's more than just a battle brother to them - making Spike thrilled and Alexandra grumpy]
