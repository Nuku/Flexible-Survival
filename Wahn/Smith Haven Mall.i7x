		say "     Four wolverine watchmen stand guard at the entrance of the large and very open brothel, harshly deflecting those who just want to rush in or anyone who gets too unruly. A few infected lying in a groaning heap in a corner seem to have been the previous targets of the wolverine's fierce protectiveness. Between them stands what might be the caricature of a loan shark - it is an actual anthro shark, wearing a suit that is surprisingly well-tailored for his not quite human body. From the looks of it, the guy is the boss here.";


the scent of Shag Shack Entrance is "Scent of messy sex hangs in the air - which isn't surprising, as you can see numerous people humping on the sales floor right now.".

A granite-tiled floor and light gray walls set the frame for a modern-looking reception desk with a curved glass front. Beside it, a bright green potted plant gives the whole room a friendly feeling. The rest of the room is filled with several stands holding brochures about current lots the firm owns, flanking a small seating area of white leather armchairs.";
		say "     Surprisingly, the reception is staffed even at this time of night and in the midst of everything going on - a pretty anthro doe wearing a pristine white shirt is sitting behind the desk, giving you a well-practiced welcoming smile. Indirect lighting illuminates the room quite well - including one lamp that seems to be right under the desk-top. This shines right upon the woman's long, cream-colored legs, allowing you a teasing view of her assets through the only very lightly frosted glass front of the desk.";

The light draws your attention to the fact that the glass front of the desk is only very lightly frosted, allowing a teasing view of the woman's long, cream-colored legs behind it.";

to say BPOfficesDesc:
	say "     The offices of the firm [']Branson & Partner Land Management['] have an air of understated elegance that shows you're in a respectable business establishment. A granite-tiled floor and light gray walls set the frame for a row of modern-looking desks all lined up so that the attractive women sitting at them are facing your way and can greet you with professional smiles. As with the front desk, sheets of lightly frosted glass allow for some enticing glimpses of their long legs, usually ending in hooves or paws. Even the potted plants scattered throughout the large room are obviously still getting watered, shining in a healthy green. All in all, Branson's office staff makes the scene before you appear like it was set in a perfectly normal office on a perfectly normal day.";
	say "     Only the fact that none of the young women in here are human breaks the illusion a bit, as does the fact that one of the meeting rooms further back resembles a sleepover locale. There are mattresses spread out over the floor back there, complete with numerous blankets and pillows, creating a communal sleeping pad.";
