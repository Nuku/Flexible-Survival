It's a fairly out of the way corner of the camp, so just the right spot for a private conversation. 'So. What's going on here? You helped me out with that hyena out there on the streets, and after that... well, you know what you did. And now you're just casually wandering into a secure army camp?' For a second, you wonder how he'd react if you said that the camp isn't really that secure, what with their own horny minotaur bull breeding [if HP of Adam > 3]both male and female soldiers[else]all of the strapping soldier hunks[end if] right in the center and everyone's reasoning pretty out of whack given the constant cloud of the bull-man's musk inflaming people's libido pretty fiercely.

I was basically just swinging back around to return to the camp, through streets that weren't barricaded, infested or... alive, when I learned that I wasn't the only one making use of the clear routes.

Let me guess: Why didn't I just tell those fuckers to fuck off straight away, rifle up and finger on the trigger? Well, it's like this - bringing a knife to a gunfight isn't as stupid as it might sound. Those guys had lain in ambush and were fairly close to me. Sure, I could nail one, no problem, but both before the other stabbed me? That's dicey. With that crazy nanite regeneration the infected have, it's not even guaranteed that the guy I might have shot would have stayed down.

They tried to get me, but that almost led to Stevens being crushed by a claw, so in the end they couldn't do anything but run.'

So, when I came to, I was lying on a bed, under a thin blanket. My head was throbbing and hurting, and when I groggily lifted a hand to my head, I felt a bandage taped to the wound. Then I heard a woman say, 'Don't touch that, you'll make it bleed again,' followed by someone grabbing my wrist and gently but firmly pulling my arm back down. Must have passed out again right after that too.'

And at that point I suddenly was being taken care of by two anthros, which were just normal, you know. Persons with fur, but nothing deviant about them. Their names are Arianna and Brayden Baker, a brother/sister duo that moved here about two years back from out east, sharing a flat together. They caught the infection at some point, couldn't even tell me when and where exactly, turning into anthro black labradors. Good folks though, as they pulled me out of the rubble and took care of me. You can't imagine how relieved I was to learn that there's still a bunch of sane people left in the city, and it was them that found me. Who knows what'd have happened to me if they didn't.'

Scratching the back of his neck, the black soldier chuckles to himself, 'After some more rest that afternoon, I started feeling better finally. Had dinner with the two of them, explaining that I'd have to move out the next morning and report in at the camp. Arianna told me that I should get another day of rest at least, reaching out to pat my forearm. Could have sworn she gave me one of 'those' looks when she did, you know, but duty's duty, so I had to hold firm with leaving them once the sun was up the next morning. Well, a little while later, after the three of us talked for some time, I got into bed and dozed off. Boy did I have a sexy dream that night - only to wake up and find it wasn't a dream, and someone was actually giving me an amazing blowjob! That long muzzle, you know, and the tongue! Mmmhhh - haven't been deep-throated too often as it's hard to find a girl who wants to do it or has the skill, but this was better than that!'";

Almost as soon as those words passed my lips, the bobbing slowed, and then I heard a voice that was definitively not female say, 'Guess again!' Throwing aside the blanket, I saw Brayden's face down over my crotch, with a huge grin on his muzzle and licking its sides with his tongue. 'Thought I'd give you a proper sendoff,' he said and just licked my dickhead again. 'I was all - Dude, I'm straight!' but he just replied, 'Everyone's got flaws. I won't hold it against you!' and then went to town on my dick. I was startled by seeing the head of a dog going down on me at first, but then I gave myself a push and slowly closed my eyes as I laid back.

After he swallowed my load, he just kept on gently suckling and groped my balls, then blew me [italic type]again[roman type] when I got hard a second time! Brayden seemed ready to drain my balls, but after that time I was beat and told him to stop. With a last lick over my dickhead, he actually did stop and stood up from the bed, a black form in a dark room, as naked as myself and with his cock erect between his legs. 'Okay, guess I'll let you rest then and take care of this on my own. Unless you've changed your mind about this 'being straight' thing, maybe?' he said to me, and when I shook my head, he playfully wagged his dick at me, then walked out of the room, quietly closing the door behind him.'";

Visibly embarrassed for a moment, he adds, 'Thank god Brayden was a good sport. It's almost like he recognized that he'd pushed me as far as he could that night. And to be honest - he gave me one of the best blowjobs I've ever had. Things get crazy in this city, but sometimes in a good way too. And it's not like Brayden was feral or anything, just an advenurous gay man. Didn't betray our nighttime activities in any way the next morning and acted perfectly normal when we had breakfast together, then sent me off with a firm handshake in the end. Okay, he did lean in and tell me that I should come over if I ever wanted another round too, but that's nothing against all those rape-y creatures wandering around in the streets.' Shrugging, Monty adds, 'I've been back once or twice to visit them, and check if they're okay.

Then I hear the clatter of metal on the asphalt behind me. Glancing back, it's just an empty can rolling over the street. There wasn't any wind though, and the street seemed otherwise empty, so that was quite suspicious. Cautiously moving further, I kept looking left and right, trying to watch all approaches, when suddenly something colorful poked up from the high grass in an overgrown lot beside the street. Did you ever play cowboys and indians as a kid? It was one of those children's feather headdresses, with brightly colored feathers.

Before I knew it, blunt plastic arrows were hitting me in the chest. But that wasn't the end of it. Around the corner of a car wreck on the other side of the street, the five cowboys came rushing in just a moment later. More weasels, these with children's cowboy hats, wildly firing toy revolvers into the air. You know, the ones with a cork on a string. Weasels to my left, weasels to my right, all dashing forward at breakneck speed.

Next, he stretched his neck to focus on my backpack. 'Got any food in there? We really are hungry!' By that point, I was surrounded on all sides by them, with others touching my pants legs and one adventurous female peering up the inside of it, so I basically wrenched off the pack and just emptied out my rations. That caused a stampede of them going for the MRE's, leaving me free for a second to get out of there. Oh, and the two leaders who had a shouting match 30 seconds before?

So I lower the rifle and crouch down, holding out my hand and call, 'Come here boy, what are you doing here alone?' He walked forward a few steps, his gaze moving back and forth between my hand and face. And then he spoke, in a really sarcastic tone: 'Gosh, what do ya think? Mostly just trying to find someone who isn't sex-mad and still has thumbs, that's what! Not gonna lick you, if that's what you expect. And why the hell would you even let yourself be licked?

Before our horrified eyes, the line between her hips and his ass seemed to disappear, them simply melding together! Took just a few moments for his arms and legs to shrink and pull in against the dude's 'body' - only it wasn't so much that anymore, but rather a humongous tube of cockflesh!

Miming being covered by thick, slimy cum all over, Monty shakes his head. 'We ran, gotta be honest about that. I mean, imagine seeing shit like that without much warning. And no one knew yet if those immunity boosters actually did work. Thankfully, the bitch could barely stand with her new mega dick, so we made a clean getaway.

If his skin wasn't so very dark, you bet the young man would be flushed red in the face. 'Well, err, it's for a possible cure of this plague or whatever it is. At least that's what we were told. Sounds crazy, right? But then, what isn't these days? Hell, if I had told anyone about seeing a guy in the street suddenly sprouting wings, boobs and a beak, then trying to have sex with me, I'd have ended up in the brig with a drug test ordered. Now, something like that is just another thing that goes on everywhere.' With a shrug, Monty waves a hand in the air. 'I swore an oath to lay my life on the line for this country. Guess that includes my behind too. So if your superiors tell you to get mino-fucked, you soldier on and bend over, spread em and take it. Couldn't let my brothers[if CampBravoWomenAllowed is 1] and sisters[end if] in arms do so and not lay my own ass on the line either.'";
	say "     Scratching the back of his neck, the black soldier adds, 'Of course, having to come back here and admit that I 'lost my load' was an after-action report from hell. Thank god I'm not the only one, or even first that happened too. They don't even reprimanded me - not for something I never trained for. And that's the rub of it. I got issued a 'training kit' by the quartermaster and she told me to work out [italic type]those[roman type] muscles so I can get a fresh load delivered without issues.' Pressing his lips together, he is quiet for a moment, then adds, 'I - er, I'm having some trouble making myself do it. It's one thing when you're part of a whole group, and everyone lines up for Tiny because that's what you're ordered to do. Sitting with your fellows in a tent and then pulling out sex toys to work on yourself? That's frickin['] hard!'";

Would be less awkward than groping around cluelessly myself. Fine, it's a deal. Still need a place to do it, though.' He looks to the side thoughtfully, biting his lip, then actually focuses on what is right in front of his eyes. 'Hmmm. You know, this bus might be sticking far enough through the wall that the front door is accessible.' Quickly walking along the side of the crashed bus, he digs his fingers under the corner of a cracked windowpane, levering the safety glass out of its frame. Cracked and spider-webbed as it may be, it still comes out as a single piece that he catches and sets down without too much noise.";

He hurries off, to return a little while later with a big wooden crate in his arms, on which a mid-sied leather case is lying. Setting the crate down under the bus window creates a stepping stone to climb into it fairly easy now, and the two of you walk down the middle passage of the bus to enter the office building next door. It's a bit of a mess in there, with the bus having thrown several desks partway through the room when it crashed through the wall, but the empty building still is just the out of the way place that Monty wanted. Pulling a zipper and then flipping open the lid of the case, the soldier lays what turns out to be a complete set of variously-sized training butt-plugs on the nearest table. There's even a bottle of lube in there too. 'So, let's do this, before I lose my nerve.' Monty says, slightly nervous.";

With a decisive movement, he pushes them down complete with his underwear, then straightens to stand before you completely naked. He gives you a nod and gets into position, legs spread and with his upper body bent over the desk, forehead resting on the fabric of his shirt.

In fact, from the looks of it he's quite tight and you can't see any hint of the fact that he had a minotaur's thick schlong shoved inside him recently. Maybe wandering around for hours with nanite-laden cum inside him did have an effect after all, rejuvenating Monty somehow even if it didn't infect him.

'Nnnghh, do that again!' he calls out breathlessly and you happily oblige, drawing further sounds of arousal from your naked soldier. Soon, you add a second finger to the first, finding his hole tightly gripping yet stretchable and him appreciative of the stimulation. 'Never thought it could feel so good to just be rubbed a bit back there.' It is fun to play around with the handsome brown-skinned man since he's quite responsive, letting out gasps and moans while you experiment to find all of his pleasure spots.

It is clear to you that you have to work him up slowly to accept the plug, so you take your time and tease the man with gentle touches to relax his opening. Finally, you push in gently against the ring of muscle, smiling as you see it stretch and allow the blunt tip in. Continuing with circling movements of the latex toy, you sink it deeper into Monty's purplish-pink asshole, up till the point where its widest part slips past the ring. Suddenly, the rest of the toy just slides in, his straining pucker now actually speeding it along and pulling in around the butt plug's narrower neck.";

His anxiety seems to lift now that it is all in and you can hear a sigh of relief from the tense man, followed by his muscles flexing experimentally around the sex toy. 'Doesn't feel half bad, you know. Just kinda full, but in a good way.' One of his hands moves to touch the plug, poking lightly at it, then taking hold of the base and tugging a little. 'Wow, it's stuck in there good, isn't it?' You comment that he shouldn't worry about that, what goes in will come out again without too much trouble. You take in your handiwork with a grin before you move aside a little and lay one hand on Monty's shoulder and pull him up to stand straight. As you do so, the full extent of his pleasure from your play becomes apparent, as his 10-inch cock is hard and erect. He's puzzled momentarily about what you want, but you quickly enlighten him by waving a hand and saying that he should walk a few steps with the plug in him.

Following your gaze, the soldier becomes a bit embarrassed at the sign of his own arousal. Grabbing hold of the shaft, he flicks it lightly to the side sending a sting of pre flying to streak on the side of a desk. 'Err, I - um. This is harder than it was before, you know. With nothing else on my body to distract, this thing draws my attention all the time. It shifts a bit when I walk.'

The black-scaled anthro dragon steps up to the shattered remains of the glass entrance door and looks at the two of you, first warily then with a smile spreading over her muzzle as she recognizes you. Meanwhile, Monty stops in his tracks, looking wide-eyed at the former security guard, then bursting out with the words, 'Wow, there's a guard dragon here?! What kind of place is this?' Taking his comment with a chuckle, Orthas saunters closer, half-spreading her wings to make herself more imposing. 'Not quite, soldier-boy. What I am is a dragoness. These things here should be a hint,' she says to him, demonstratively cupping her F-cup breasts with both hands and giving them a squeeze. This draws the soldier's gaze down to the quite well-rounded bumps under her over-stretched uniform shirt, and he misses it completely as she then holds out one hand for him to shake.";

But you can call me Monty.' With a smile that shows her many sharp teeth, Orthas replies, 'Monty it is then. Welcome to the Trevor Labs. I bet you're here to see Doctor Matt, right? This doesn't look like a rescue party, with just the two of you by your lonesome.' At this point, you jump in for a bit, explaining that the black soldier is with the beachhead troops that set up a camp in the inner city and that the evacuation of any survivors seems to be off a while yet. Orthas accepts this with a friendly enough shrug and says, 'No rest for the guard dragoness yet then, eh? Go right up, he's in his lab as usual and you know the way.'";

I don't mind at all - they're fun to play with myself.' It's a bit hard to tell with his quite dark skin, but you're fairly sure Monty is blushing as he catches up with you a moment later. Without comment and doing your best to suppress a smile, you climb the stairs with him and enter the research lab where Doctor Matt is working on solving the riddle of the nanite plague. The familiar red hazmat suit isn't immediately apparent as you come in, so you call out, answered a moment later by a voice saying, 'Over here! Could you walk a bit closer, I can't really see you from this angle.' Curious what is going on, you and Monty walk deeper into the lab and you realize that the voice is actually coming from a speaker on the wall.

'Welcome, good to see you again. And I see you have brought another visitor too,' the silver-haired scientist says in a friendly tone, adjusting his glasses before addressing Monty. 'You are a member of the armed forces, young man? I am Doctor Matthew Burnell, but most just call me Doctor Matt. May I ask what brings you here? To my knowledge, the plan to evacuate the city is not yet ready, so it can't be that already.' Coming to attention before the older man, Monty says, 'Corporal Montgomery Freeman, sir! My companion told me that you were very knowledgable about the nanite infection and... there's something about, em, my body I was hoping you might help me with.'";
	say "     Raising one eyebrow inquisitively, Doctor Matt nods. 'Well then, Mister Freeman, go ahead and explain. Leave nothing out, even the smallest detail might be of importance.' After saying this, the doctor moves over to a working table, picking up a clipboard and a pen to take notes. 'Ah, before you start - which serum are you on? Given your human appearance, I assume you're part of the troops that were given the experimental nanite countermeasures? Also, do you have an injector on hand that you might be able to give me? I assure you it will greatly help in my research.' Monty's brows draw together for a second, then he pulls his backpack off and opens a side pocket, pulling a bright red auto-injector with an orange protective cap out of it. 'You mean this thing? It's, XN-02. I guess you can have it, as long as I'm back in the camp within the next five hours. We were given strict orders not to miss a single scheduled injection.'";

Please place it next to the sampling rack on that table over there,' Doctor Matt in clearly audible excitement, making notes in between following Monty with his gaze as he walks through the other room. From your position, you can see the paper a little bit, so you crane your neck and see 'XN-02' with the 2 doubly underlined and the words 'No danger of liquification' written underneath. When Monty returns to the window a moment later, Doctor Matt draws an detailed account of what happened from him, asking questions in an uncompromisingly direct way that has the other man pausing in embarrassment more than once, for example at several questions of the exact size of Tiny's erection and how it felt inside him, as well as making Monty guess about the volume of cum that was put into him and the length of time his insides were soaking in the beast-man's seed.";
	say "     Deep in thought for a long while as he re-reads his notes and taps the side of his pen against the clipboard, Doctor Matt eventually looks up again and says, 'Quite interesting, I must say. I've got a theory about what might be happening, but I'll have to examine you to confirm it. Mister Freeman, would you please strip down and sit over there on that examination table. I will be with you in a little while.' Not waiting for a reply, the doctor moves over to the double airlock and starts the process of putting on his suit, complete with pressure checks and everything before he comes out into the same room as you and Monty. The black man nervously awaits him as instructed, completely naked and with his clothes and gear in a neat stack off on a side table. The next forty minutes or so are filled with a quite thorough examination of the black soldier, with numerous samples being taken: blood, skin from several spots, hair, even a semen sample, as well as Matt asking his patient to 'spread' himself with his fingers since he doesn't have the medical tools available to do so. As the black man does so, he lets out a little gasp, and the simple touch causes his cock to throb.";

You can get dressed again,' Doctor Matt starts analyzing the samples, speaking quiet notes into a recorder and beginning with the words, 'New patient: Montgomery Freeman, age 22, African-American.' From what you've already seen and heard of the doctor, you decide it might be best to leave him working in peace and not expose Monty to the unfiltered revelations Matt will put in his notes. Waving to Monty to follow, you lead him back downstairs to the lobby. Orthas seems ready to take up her teasing again, but after a quick glance at the soldier's still tense expression, she pushes that aside. No one really seems in the mood to talk too much right now, so everyone stands around a little glumly, until Orthas eventually pulls out a deck of cards from a pants pocket and asks, 'Anyone up for a round of poker?'";
	say "     The three of you move to sit on some of the less damaged pieces of lobby furniture and play cards for what feels like quite a while, using glass shards of various sizes as ersatz money. Interestingly, Monty ends up with a quite admirable stack of fragments of the front door in front of himself. You can't quite tell if he's good at poker or just lucky today, although there's a little suspicion in you hat Orthas might be letting him win at least some of the time. She certainly does her best to be friendly, that's for sure. Some time later, the sound of creaking rubber makes you look up and see the red-suited form of Doctor Matt up at the railing of the stairs to the upper floor. 'Ah, there you are. I've got some results to show you,' he says, then turns around and goes back into his lab.";

Orthas tells Monty in a friendly tone, reaching out to pat his leg above the knee and giving it a gentle squeeze. 'Thank you,' the black man replies, touching the dragoness's arm, then gets up and quickly takes the stairs two steps at a time. You hurry after him, also curious about what Matt found out. Arriving in the lab, you are greeted by Matt standing in front of a workstation with some fairly large scientific device on it. 'If you would direct your attention to the screen over there, I can show you something interesting,' he says, fiddling with the equipment as he does so. You watch the image on the screen, which depicts a skin sample, likely one of Monty's. Then a syringe or something moves closer, delivering a droplet of fluid to touch it, after which you can see the skin rapidly being transformed.";

The doctor adjusts something and a second syringe deposits a droplet to mix with the first, which instantly stops the ongoing transformation, leaving the sample halfway changed. 'What Mister Freeman and his compatriots are injecting themselves with are nanites too, who do nothing but search out other nanites and destroy them. Contrary to the rogue, highly developed nanites that are causing this city-wide outbreak, which do have some swarm-movement capability, the experimental devices depend on being moved by external forces. In short, blood being pumped throughout a host's body and carrying them along. This is a valid method of transportation that spreads their protection in the body. But not quite everywhere.' Stepping up to a drawing board, he sketches a diagram of what you recognize as human skin, with various different layers.";

It is further made up of different strata of cells: corneum, granulosum, spinosum and basale. The only place where cells are created is the basal stratum at the bottom, after which they are pushed upwards by further newly formed cells and adapt to specific purposes. The important point for Mister Freeman is that there are no blood vessels in the epidermis, with only the lowest stratum being supplied through the blood vessels of the dermis beneath. So they are the last cells that actually are in contact with the hunter-killer nanites.' That said, he takes two differently colored markers and shades the lower half of the sketch green, the upper half red.";
	say "     'During his prolonged exposure to nanite-rich seminal fluid, Mister Freeman's upper cell layers got worked on by the invading nanites. Frankly, they're now far superior to normal skin - more flexible, mobile and structured in a flawless pattern. This results in higher resistance to damage, rapid healing of wounds and increased stretchability. What they do not possess is the ability to reproduce, and since his basal cells were protected, the effect will wear off eventually as the epidermis skin cells flake off naturally over time.' Capping his markers and turning back to the two of you, Doctor Matt gives you a smile. 'A fascinating case to study, thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so. Are there any questions?' Monty shakes himself out of staring at the diagram, reaching one arm behind his back as if to touch his ass, then shying away from doing so. 'So you're saying I got a minotaur ass now? Will I get hairy and whatnot else? Or even a tail?!'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With the sigh of a teacher having to deal with a somewhat slow student, Matt points at the diagram. 'For your first question: Technically yes, but there is generally little differentiation between epidermis cells in any of the mammalian strains I have been able to study so far. But even if you had formed reptilian scales, without cell replenishment those would flake off over time too.' Adding a bulbous shape beneath the previously sketched layers and drawing long parallel lines upwards that penetrate all the way up through the skin, he adds, 'As for question two: No, hair-forming cells are part of the dermis. No attacking nanites had a chance of reaching them. Same thing for your third question. Forming a tail is impossible without an infection in replicating cells.' You can hear a sigh of relief from Monty at those words and the black soldier strokes over his shaved head as he blows out a long breath. 'Thank you for explaining it to me, doctor. It's a relief to hear that I'm still human and there won't be any long-term side effects.'";

The insights into your condition as well as the samples of nanite countermeasures you provided will help greatly in my work to understand this rogue nanite spread.' He gives Monty a friendly smile and then turns towards you. 'Thank you for bringing him to me. You're a valued assistant.' The three of you exchange some more words of casual conversation, then Monty suggests you get back to the army camp, thanking Doctor Matt again as he leaves the lab. Walking down the stairs soon after, you're awaited by Orthas leaning against the wall in the lobby. 'That's more like it, eh? Our soldier boy is smiling again! Got some good news from the doc?' she asks, directing her attention at the soldier walking ahead of you. Monty clears his throat and replies, 'Yeah actually. I'm still fully human, in everything that counts at least!' 'Congrats!'

Afterwards, he looks back and forth between the two of you, trying to come up with something fitting to say, but Orthas waves him off with a smile. 'I can see you're on the jump, and don't wanna keep you. Next time then, eh?' This is delivered with a wink and oh so casual shake of her chest, making the breasts of the dragoness wobble enticingly. 'Be safe out there, and don't be strangers you two. It's so hard these days to find anyone to hang out with.' After some friendly pats, Monty and you leave the Trevor Labs buildings and retrace your steps back to the military camp.

Soon wrapping your fingers around the base of his long cock and giving the 10-inch shaft an eager stroke, you look him in the eyes and wiggle your eyebrows at him. Monty chuckles, clearing his throat and saying, 'Man, I never thought being deployed right here in the country to deal with this messy situation could ever have any sort of upside, but this sure feels like fun.' You just grin in reply, then sink to your knees before the African-American man.";

He grins and shifts his hips a little, playfully slapping your face with his big cock and reaching out to rest a hand on top of your head. 'Oh yeah! Go for it!' he pants as you stick your tongue out, then begin to trace it up the underside of his shaft. Your black soldier buddy's fingers stroke over your head, guiding you a little as you lick over his erection and quickly arrive at the head. Parting your lips, you slide them over his cock and feel the firm yet yielding curve of his mushroom head against your tongue, complete with a first little taste of his pre-cum. Monty's flavor on your taste-buds is quite nice actually, waking the desire for more. Healthy living and physical fitness definitely seems to help with that, and you send mental thanks to the army as you go down on the man-candy they delivered for you here.";

You can feel his erection throbbing against your tongue and throat as you hold your position for a long moment, your muscles squeezing his length every time you swallow and making his grip on your head tighten as he moans out loud. Monty gets a little bit lost in the pleasure of the moment, so much so that you have to tap out against the side of his hip for him to let you pull back and catch your breath. As you do so, strings of spit and pre-cum stretch between his cock and your lips, which he wipes away with his index finger, then pushes it into your mouth for you to suck clean.";

Thankfully he pulls out at least momentarily before each deep plunge, so you manage to gulp down a little air in the second before feeling the black man's balls slap your chin again. Still, even so you get a little bit light-headed as you're used by the well-muscled male, willingly receiving his cock as your eyes wander over his naked body and take in the sweat now glistening on the firm lines of his chest.";

His volume only increases over time, making it a very good thing that your love-nest is somewhat out of the way and not just behind a tent or so, otherwise the whole camp would know about your tight throat by now.

Soon after, the extent of his exhaustion from the face-fuck session hits him and he slumps forward a little, moving a hand to brace on your shoulder. 'That. Was. Amazing!' he pants out, a beaming smile on his face. You stand up and lay your arms around his heaving, warm and somewhat sweaty chest, allowing Monty to lean into you until he catches his breath.

Getting back into eating out the horny man, you lap at his inner walls and wiggle your tongue, all the while stroking his erection up and down.

Now that you're no longer trapped in the heat of the moment, you realize that your own legs are a bit cramped up from the prolonged crouch, so you rise with a groan and stretch them while walking around a few steps.

His legs tremble a little from the sudden expansion of his inner muscle. Once you're past the thicker bit, it slides out of Monty almost on its own, slick and tapering as it is. Yet before it does so, you grind the toy back into his hole, aiming to rub Monty's prostate with its blunt tip. The black man lets out a surprised, pleasurable grunt, followed by a lusty groan as you reach around him to grasp his erection. Jerking his thick trouser-snake while pushing the plug past the quivering ring of his hole drives Monty wild.

As awkward as this is, I don't know what I'd do if I had to do the 'training' on my own.' After this, you rustle up a box of tissues and clean the used toy while Monty gets dressed.
