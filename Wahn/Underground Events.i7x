Instead of resolving a Captive Breeding:
	say "     Walking through the dark passages of the expansive underground warren that is in the basement of the Trevor Labs, you hear something from up ahead - moaning. Who might that be, down here in the lair of the tentacle beasts? Warily, you move closer to the source of the noise. Looking into the doorway of a storage room filled with rows of shelves, you find a woman, lying on the ground. Spread-eagled, her forearms and lower legs are stuck to the ground by some kind of substance, looking like solidified slimy goo. She's naked, and her belly bulges massively upwards in obvious pregnancy.";
	say "     Moving closer, you try talking to her, but the only answers you're getting are more gasps and moans. Judging from some clear goop smeared around her mouth, you'd guess something's been... feeding her, to keep her alive in captivity. Most likely whatever that is is laden with drugs and aphrodisiacs too, with as unfocused her eyes are right now. Your examination is interrupted by a sudden splashing noise and a gasp from the human woman. Looking down, you see a puddle of slime spread between her legs and the skin of her belly ripple with movement under it.";
	say "     [line break]";
	say "     Uh oh - seems like what's in her wants out - now! What do you do? Stay with the woman [link](1)[as]1[end link], observe what's happening - from a distance [link](2)[as]2[end link] or get the hell out of there [link](3)[as]3[end link]?";
	now calcnumber is 0;

	if calcnumber is 1:								[stay with the woman]
		say "     Suddenly thrust into this unusual situation, you decide to do your best in helping the woman give birth to... whatever it is. Taking hold of her hand, which thankfully isn't covered by her goo bindings, you try to calm her a bit with soft-spoken words and wipe the sweat of labor off her brow. From your ringside seat, you watch a tentacle with a whole row of suckers worm its way out of the woman's vagina, followed by another and another, all of them taking hold on the floor and the woman's legs as the creature struggles to pull itself out of her womb. Helped along by the woman's contractions, soon the little tentacle monster slips out of her with a wet, sloshing noise. Then it scuttles off, vanishing under a shelf faster than you could catch it.";
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     You're left alone with the human woman, down in the sub-levels of the Trevor Labs. What to do now... your thoughts wander to getting her out of here, but not knowing when (or even if) her current lust-addled state would end, you abandon that quickly. In this infested place, being burdened by a semiconscious person would surely end up getting you in deep, deep trouble. Well, at least her captor seems to keep her alive - there's still hope she can be rescued and taken care of eventually, maybe if the military moves in. Though how many monsters will be bred in her in the meantime you can only wonder about.";
		if cocks of player > 0 and libido of player > 40:		
			say "     [cuckold choice]";
		say "     You stroke the captive woman's hair, telling her to hold out, then leave and make your way through the creepy dark tunnels, back towards the surface. As you move along, unidentified noises around and behind you make you speed up, then run, until you reach the entrance of the cellar and throw the door closed behind you, breathing heavily.";
	otherwise if calcnumber is 2:			[observe]
		say "     You make your way back to the hallway you came from and peek around the corner to watch what's happening in the room. The captive woman pants and gasps as contractions run through her lower body, then you see a tentacle with a whole row of suckers emerge from her pussy, taking hold of her leg to pull the rest of the creature free. Another and another follows, and soon the woman's monstrous offspring emerges with a wet, sloshing noise. It quickly scuttles off, vanishing under a shelf faster than you'd have thought.";
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     You're left looking at the human woman, lying on the floor moaning.

	otherwise:												[leave]
		say "     This is getting way to creepy for you. You flee back up to the surface, followed by the echoing moans and sounds of the captive woman's unnatural birth.";  	
	now Captive Breeding is resolved;
	
to say cuckold choice:
	say "     A deviant thought worms his way into your head, coupled with a twitch of your cock. There is one way you could... preempt the tentacle monster impregnating her with more of its offspring. But no, you couldn't just knock her up - or could you? ";
	say "     [line break]";
	if player consents:
		say "     'It's for her own good.' echoes as a somewhat lame excuse for your actions through your horny mind as you slip off your clothes and stroke your cock to full hardness. Then you kneel between the woman's legs and bring your erection to her opening, still wet with slimy goo. She moans in arousal as she feels your cockhead against her pussy lips, then gasps as you plunge right in. Still pretty tight for just having had that creature in her - but then, it was squishy enough not to stretch her on the way out. You pump in and out of her vagina, amazed how good this feels and how full your balls feel as they get ready to blast your load into the human below you. The creature's slime lubing your shaft as it thrusts deep might have something to do with that...";
		say "     But no matter, your thoughts are fully absorbed with cuckolding the tentacle monster here and now. Speeding up your movements more and more, you finally slam in all the way and cum, burst after burst of your seed shooting into the woman's receptive womb. There, that should mix up the tentacle breeding program a bit... breathing deeply, you pull out and get your clothes back on.";
	otherwise:
		say "     Getting your impulses under control, you shake those immoral thoughts off. This place is really getting to you, that you could even imagine doing such a thing.";

Sadly, that doesn't seem to have worked out for them. Haphazardly strewn about are a number of sleeping bags, ripped articles of clothing and all kinds of other items.

Behind where the wall cover would be, there's a thick reinforced door, large enough to require powerful motors to open and close it. Whether this hidden entrance was constructed to keep something out - or in - it's wide open now, and without power to the building, it's stuck for good that way...";

Small and large, they're filled with formaldehyde in which... things are preserved. From just clumps of tentacles, over animals sprouting too many limbs or even heads, to... deformed creatures which have a dismaying resemblance to humans. Seems like even before the nanite infection, unnatural things were being done in these labs. With a shiver running down your spine, you turn away from the failed experiments and make your way back to the surface, unsuccessfully trying to forget what you saw.";
