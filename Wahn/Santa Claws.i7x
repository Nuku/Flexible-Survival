It is obviously clear that this is no timid little bear, as there are strong muscles under his white pelt, and the claws on his paw-hands and -feet do look pretty dangerous. Nevertheless, you don't feel threatened by him, since the big ursine is wearing a gloriously red and white Santa suit, golden belt buckle and all. Sitting on a wide, cushioned throne made of carved hardwood and with festive decorations carved into its sides, the bear watches his domain with a jolly smile on his face.";

Strange - but what isn't, these days. Coming closer, you see that the snowfall only really is strong for a few feet, forming a kind of curtain and little wall of snow to divide half of the east wing from the rest of the Mall. There is a break in the low snow wall though, as if to welcome you in, with a sign saying 'Christmas Village' stuck in a pile of snow beside it. Curious about the snow here inside of the building, you lean down and take a handful - finding it cool to the touch, but not freezing, and realizing that while it feels real in all other concerns, the white flakes do not melt in your hand.";

There are evergreen conifer trees that sprout out of the snow-covered ground, mostly hiding the walls and letting things appear as if you're in a midwinter forest, with the front sides of the stores appearing as block houses built from round tree trunks. There are many petite humanoids dressed in green clothes going about their business here, following tracks through the snow, chatting and laughing. Looks like they're Christmas Elves, with their unlined, delicate features and the pointy ears sticking out to the sides.";

As he lets his gaze wander over his domain, smiling at all the little elves, he notices you and waves you closer with a clawed hand. In a deep voice, the polar bear says, 'Welcome to Santa Claws's little village, visitor. Be advised that this is my realm and I don't condone violence - this is a place to be jolly, so leave any troubles outside. Rest, get your present and enjoy some time here before you have to go back - or stay, as one of my Christmas Elves, if you wish.'";

Only the north side looks different, with what appears to be an unhewn rock-wall behind the trees, complete with a somewhat foreboding entrance to a cave. There are many petite Christmas Elves dressed in green clothes going about their business here, following tracks through the snow, chatting and laughing. Among them, you see some visiting Mall rats and other species, but the majority of people are elves. In the center of it all stands a large cushioned throne, carved with many decorative designs, and on it sits Santa Claws, the master of this domain.";

Then the bear looks back to you, still with the same curious expression on your face, and adds, 'Let's not dwell on the past, okay? I'm happier being Santa Claws now than I ever was as that scared little man, running and hiding from the monsters.

It wants to push them down and mount them, breed them and leave a string of cubs growing in any and all females...' As he says this, the ursine's clawed hands start to grip the wooden throne's armrests tightly and you think that the bulge in his pants grows a bit too - then he relaxes again and shakes his head.

I believe that something more than chance brought me to wear this suit - fate led me to it, and it is my task to wear it with honor.

One look down at his hips shows you that Santa is more than ready to give you your present. His thick shaft is standing fully erect and pointing at your crotch.

Soft, white fur brushes against your naked body as the at least 1500 pound ursine covers you completely, holding himself up with strong arms as his hips position the thick cock between his legs at your opening.

He wasn't, and he didn't, with his transformation mostly an accident, caused by the aftermath of the events that he and his partner Mark witnessed before fleeing to the Mall.

Something nice, you know. Worsted wool, cashmere, maybe even silk. And please watch the thread count. Any good suit needs good fabric.

Instead of fucking the Santa Claws:
