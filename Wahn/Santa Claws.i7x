It is obviously clear that this is no timid little bear, as there are strong muscles under his white pelt, and the claws on his paw-hands and -feet do look pretty dangerous. Nevertheless, you don't feel threatened by him, since the big ursine is wearing a gloriously red and white Santa suit, golden belt buckle and all. Sitting on a wide, cushioned throne made of carved hardwood and with festive decorations carved into its sides, the bear watches his domain with a jolly smile on his face.";

Coming closer, you see that the snowfall only really is strong for a few feet, forming a kind of curtain and little wall of snow to divide half of the east wing from the rest of the Mall. There is a break in the low snow wall though, as if to welcome you in, with a sign saying 'Christmas Village' stuck in a pile of snow beside it. Curious about the snow here inside of the building, you lean down and take a handful - finding it cool to the touch, but not freezing, and realizing that while it feels real in all other concerns, the white flakes do not melt in your hand.";

There are many petite humanoids dressed in green clothes going about their business here, following tracks through the snow, chatting and laughing.

As he lets his gaze wander over his domain, smiling at all the little elves, he notices you and waves you closer with a clawed hand. In a deep voice, the polar bear says, 'Welcome to Santa Claws's little village, visitor. Be advised that this is my realm and I don't condone violence - this is a place to be jolly, so leave any troubles outside. Rest, get your present and enjoy some time here before you have to go back - or stay, as one of my Christmas Elves, if you wish.'";

There are many petite Christmas Elves dressed in green clothes going about their business here, following tracks through the snow, chatting and laughing.

Then the bear looks back to you, still with the same curious expression on your face, and adds, 'Let's not dwell on the past, okay? I'm happier being Santa Claws now than I ever was as that scared little man, running and hiding from the monsters.

It wants to push them down and mount them, breed them and leave a string of cubs growing in any and all females...' As he says this, the ursine's clawed hands start to grip the wooden throne's armrests tightly and you think that the bulge in his pants grows a bit too - then he relaxes again and shakes his head.

I believe that something more than chance brought me to wear this suit - fate led me to it, and it is my task to wear it with honor.

One look down at his hips shows you that Santa is more than ready to give you your present. His thick shaft is standing fully erect and pointing at your crotch.

Soft, white fur brushes against your naked body as the at least 1500 pound ursine covers you completely, holding himself up with strong arms as his hips position the thick cock between his legs at your opening.

I am proud to call him a friend and can honestly say that there are few people I'd prefer to have by my side if a truly dire situation came up.' Letting his gaze wander over the happy and carefree Christmas Elves living in his domain, the big white bear puts on a more serious expression for a second, then lets out a deep breath. Sometimes I wish that I too could just forget, like most of them did. But no, it is my responsibility, my duty, to protect them. Being aware of what grim realities the outside world entails is definitely part of that. When Jay and Mark came here, I recognized in him one of the worst examples of PTSD that I'd seen since... ah, no. Don't let me get you down with a tale like that, I shouldn't be gossiping about their private matters anyways. One thing I can say is that I am glad that their transformations went relatively well, and Mark is better for it now.'";

He waves the person closer and wishes them a friendly welcome, then starts to chat a bit. Apparently, your talk about the current topic is over, and as you walk away, you can't help but wonder if that is because you almost got a snippet of Santa's past, or to protect the privacy of Mark and Jay. Maybe a bit of both...";

Most of those who come and choose to stay as part of my domain are lost and just want to forget. He wasn't, and he didn't, with his transformation mostly an accident, caused by the aftermath of the events that he and his partner Mark witnessed before fleeing to the Mall. In the end, the two of them do not actually live in the Christmas Village and still have a life outside of its boundaries. They visit often though, and have become good friends of mine, which makes me glad that things worked out alright in the way that they did.'";

I do know that he despises the elf outfit, so I was wondering if you might like to help me improve at least on that part for him.' Raising a large paw-hand, the polar bear indicates the bustling crowd of elves all around you and lets out a chuckle. 'You know, all of my little charges here actually fulfill the complete stereotype of Santa's elves and have gained almost supernatural crafting skills. If [italic type]someone[roman type] brought them a good bolt of fabric, or even just the right thread, they could surely put together a proper business suit for Jay in no time at all.

He clears his throat and smiles at you, then says, 'Mostly, it is just the proper materials that we need. We elves aren't that big either, so a single bolt of fabric should do. Something nice, you know. Worsted wool, cashmere, maybe even silk. And please watch the thread count. Any good suit needs good fabric. Or, if you have trouble finding finished fabrics out there, we could even do with just thread. A loom isn't hard to put together or use.'";
