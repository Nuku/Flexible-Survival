when play begins:
	add Circle of Life to badspots of furry; 

Instead of resolving a Circle of Life:
	say "     While exploring the large expanse of the zoo, wandering along the walkways and even through the (usually breached) enclosures where the main way is blocked, you suddenly hear a not too distant roar, followed by frightened cries from a number of female voices. The sound of many hooves on asphalt comes closer very rapidly after that, so you decide to duck out of sight until you know what's going on. Hidden behind a bush, you see a whole group of anthro gazelles sprint past in full flight a moment later - but in their panic, one of the group members actually runs the wrong way at a fork just a short distance ahead. She is about two dozen feet down that way alone when she notices that something is up and stops in a scrape of hooves on stone, panting quickly as she looks back the way she came.";
	say "     You can see her muscles twitch as she is about to back-track and try to get back to the herd - but then the slender gazelle's eyes fall upon yourself and widen, freezing her mid-step. Gaze jumping from left to right as she takes in her possibilities of escape this way or that, or maybe even taking the chance to crowd into your hiding spot with you, the young woman opens her mouth as if to say something - but her time is already up. A satisfied roar sounds from where the fleeing herd originally came from, prompting the gazelle to run straight ahead after all. Moments later, the powerful form of a male lion flashes past you - part anthro but still bounding after her on all fours.";
	say "     [bold type]Just having explored that fork of the way a short while ago, you remember that it soon ends in a tunnel blocked by some sort of hardened goop. There is no escape for the fleeing gazelle that way![roman type][line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Run after the two of them. You want to see how this turns out - or maybe do something...";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Get out of here while the lion still busy. You don't want to be his next prey after her.";
	if player consents: [go after them]
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     Hurrying after the gazelle and lion, you're just in time to see him corner her at the blocked tunnel end, pouncing on the helpless anthro. The muscular lion is on top of her in a second, pinning the lithe woman to the ground and giving her a very wide smile with his tooth-filled muzzle. 'P-please don't eat me!' she whimpers in fright, futilely struggling against his strong paw-hands holding her. The lion chuckles in a deep voice, then brings his head down to her neck, opening his muzzle wider and wider... only to follow that up with just a playful lick before pushing himself up again. 'Never said I was gonna - but I might eat you out if you're a good girl,' the feline predator tells his captive.";
		say "     After that, he pulls the gazelle's arms above her head and holds her wrist with just one hand, freeing the other one to cup her petite breasts. 'Oh. Ooooohhhh!' comes the reply of the young woman, surprise audible in her voice as she realizes that her captor isn't the bloodthirsty type after all. As he licks her breasts and gives the lightest of nips to one nipple, then the other, her panic melts away, with the herbivore no longer trembling in fear under the bulk of the lion. She clearly can't help but respond with arousal to the licks and caresses he gives her and doesn't try to escape even as he soon lets go of her wrists.";
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     [bold type]Well, this situation doesn't seem as dire as you first thought. Given what else is going on all over the city, the thought rises in your mind that you shouldn't try to interfere in this 'chase with happy ending'. Playing sex police is a fool's errand anyways. After a moment, you decide to:[roman type][line break]";
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Watch what happens next. A large, muscular lion mating a pretty female gazelle, that's something you don't see every day...";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Get out of here.";
		if player consents: [watch]
			say "     [line break]";
			say "     With the urgency taken out of the situation, you take your time to study the two entwined anthros in detail. On top is the lion, a proud specimen with golden fur shining in the light. His coat is short enough to allow you to clearly see the rippling muscles of his body, making it clear that this is one strong kitty. Between his legs, you can make out a thick erection, bearing numerous soft spines along its length, promising quite an experience for anyone laying with the feline. A handsome face with a confident expression and a large mane of brown fur completes the image of this king of the savanna. Below the lion, trembling in lust now that he is caressing and teasing her body, the beautiful gazelle is stretched out on the ground.";
			say "     Her body fits the typical image of a flight animal, lithe and thin, built for impressive bursts of speed to get away from any attacker - which she would have, in an open area without dead ends like this. The young woman's coat of short fur is brown on most of her shapely body, with a black streak running down the sides of her chest to divide her breasts and flat stomach from the rest, having a creamy white color instead. This draws attention to her small but perky breasts and the slit of her pussy further down, the fur around that already looking a bit matted from how wet the situation makes her.";
			say "     [WaitLineBreak]";
			say "     Eyes closed and with her head raised at the end of the young gazelle's long neck, she lets out loud moans, readily accepting what the male on top of her does to wind her up. Then suddenly, he kisses her on the muzzle, making the horned woman open her eyes in surprise... and reply in kind, making out with her captor. As she moans into his mouth and slides her arms around his maned neck to hold on, the lion aligns his erection with the white landing strip of her belly fur, placing the head of his cock right at the start - directly above the herbivore's pussy.";
			say "     With a growl of arousal reverberating in the depths of his broad chest, the lion slides himself into his much smaller partner, overwhelming her with the sheer girth of his manhood. The young woman holds on for dear life as he sinks himself into her depths, stretching that pussy wide and soon making her belly bulge a little with the visible outline of his prick. 'Nnnnghh! Nice and tight,' the lion roars loudly as he bottoms out, while his partner is still simply panting and making animalistic sounds of lust. He keeps his body still for a moment to give her time to adjust, meanwhile licking the gazelle's neck again and kissing her.";
			say "     [WaitLineBreak]";
			say "     The period of grace for the gazelle doesn't last all that long - not with a horny lion having his dick squeezed by her stretched pussy and soon reaching the end of his restraint. As he proceeds to pull his cock out of her most of the way, the slender herbivore gasps loudly - no doubt from the sensations of his nubby spines rubbing her inner passage. 'Like that?' he asks with a grin, giving a shallow thrust and withdrawing once more. 'Yeeeesssss, oh GOD! Fuck me!' she replies, her fingers digging into his mane as she trembles in lust.";
			say "     Laughing at the very enthusiastic exclamation of consent, the lion starts pounding his smaller partner relentlessly, one arm wrapped around her chest, the other cupping her ass to pull her up against his deep thrusts. There is something animalistic about their mating - as one would expect from an anthro gazelle and lion - and the two of them fill the area with loud moans, growls, roars and lust-filled shouts as they buck against each other. It is a wild ride for the gazelle to be fucked by the powerful feline on top of her, culminating with him driving himself deeply into her and letting lose a deluge of cum right into her womb. You can literally see each throb of seed arriving in her belly, as it swells up a little bit more each time.";
			say "     [WaitLineBreak]";
			say "     Soon the outline of the lion's cock isn't even visible anymore, as she swells up far enough to have what looks like a baby bump. The two of them keep panting and holding on to each other for a long time while he keeps shooting more and more cum into her. Then eventually, the gazelle starts to loosen her death-grip on his mane, slowly at first until she is sure he'll keep holding her against his chest. She slides her hand down over her body to bring it to rest against the curve of her stomach, stroking over it gingerly. 'I - it's... my fertile time,' she says hesitantly and looks the lion right in the eye.";
			say "     'I know,' he replies, giving her a grin and licks the young woman's muzzle. 'What did you think drew me to your herd? So many of you, in season together - when the wind turned, how could I NOT go after that? Especially such a sexy little beast like yourself.' Kissing her deeply, he then lowers the young woman to the floor, gently pulling his prick from her depths. Kneeling over her, the lion puts his large paw-hand on her belly and just lets it rest there for a moment. Then he adds, 'Someone has been a VERY good girl indeed. I think you deserve a reward.' With that, the large male pulls her hips up and hooks the gazelle's legs over his shoulders, bringing his muzzle right between her thighs.";
			say "     [WaitLineBreak]";
			say "     The first long lick pushes the slender herbivore to let out an aroused gasp, followed by many, many more as her captor starts to eat out her pussy. But not only that, he also puts a finger on her clit and rubs it in circling movements, driving her closer and closer to her own climax. Then she can't hold it in anymore and with a loud gasp, the gazelle trembles in his grasp, leaking cum and femcum that he happily licks off her crotch. The lion gives her time to ride out her orgasm, then gently lowers her to the ground. After a little while of catching their breaths, the two of them stand up again. He helps her to her feet as she seems a bit out of balance with the currently quite large belly.";
			say "     Making sure she's standing securely, he lets go from lightly gripping her upper arm, then steps back a little and clears his throat. 'By the way - I'm Gavin,' he tells her, giving a charming smile. Swallowing visibly, the gazelle looks at him, then down to her belly, then back at him again. Learning the name of the guy who fucked her somehow seems to make things all the more real - more than just a typical bump and grind... so she hesitates for a long moment before replying, 'Hannah. It's... nice to meet you?'";
			say "     [WaitLineBreak]";
			say "     Silence stretches out between them for a few seconds more after that, then he offers her his paw-hand and says, 'Sorry about driving away your herd. They're long gone now, so it'd be dangerous to go out and search for them alone. How about you stay with me instead?' She looks at his large paw and the claws on it with big eyes, then hesitantly takes it, sliding her own hand into his. The two of them start walking out of the dead end after that, immediately noticing you as you kinda drifted closer and closer when you watched them have sex. Hannah is rather shameful at having been observed, while Gavin just grins and says, 'Hope you liked the show.'";
			say "     With that they stroll past you, hand in hand, and soon are out of sight. Despite the rather unconventional start of their relationship, and the fact that they're totally different species, it seems the two of them are actually a good fit. What will come out of their mating is anyone's guess though - a litter of lion cubs, or gazelles, or something in between. No matter what, you have a feeling their mother will care for them lovingly, and be more than ready to spread her folds again for the proud lion that fathered her children.";
		otherwise: [leave]
			say "     [line break]";
			say "     Trying to tune out the moans and aroused whimpers from the gazelle, as well as her lion captor's growls, you turn around and walk away. Even so, the nose you hear behind you makes it quite clear that the two of them are having quite a good time. You can't help but wonder what might result from their mating - a litter of lion cubs, or gazelles, or something in between. No matter what, you have a feeling their mother will care for them lovingly, and be more than ready to spread her folds again for the proud lion that is fathering her children right as you think those thoughts.";
	otherwise: [make a getaway]
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     Trying not to listen to the frightened shouts, roars and growls coming from the direction both of the beast-people ran off in, you quickly walk the other way. One redeeming fact (maybe?) is that the noise goes on and on, so you don't think the predator went after the gazelles for food. Flashes of what might be going on between them instead dominate your imagination until you finally are out of earshot.";
	now battleground is "void";	[blocks a random fight after this]
	now Circle of Life is resolved;
	
Zoo Events ends here.
