Instead of resolving a Circle of Life:
	say "     While exploring the large expanse of the zoo, wandering along the walkways and even through the (usually breached) enclosures where the main way is blocked, you suddenly hear a not too distant roar, followed by frightened cries from a number of female voices. In the subsequent moments, the sound of hooves on asphalt comes closer rapidly as you decide to duck out of sight until you know more about what is going on. Hidden behind a bush, you see a whole group of anthro gazelles sprint past in full flight - Paniced, one of the group members actually runs the wrong way at a fork just a short distance ahead. She is about two dozen feet down when she notices that something is up as she takes in the lack of her kin around her. Stopping in a scrape of hooves upon stone, the separated gazelle heavily pants as she looks back the way she came.";
	say "     The anthro girl looks around frantically as her muscles tighten, she is about to backtrack and try to get back to the herd - but then her eyes fall upon yourself and widen, causing her to freeze mid-step. Gaze jumping from left to right, she takes in all the possibilities of escape from every angle. Unfortunately for her, before she is able to make a clear decision, her time is up. A satisfied roar sounds from the site of the now long-gone herd, prompting the gazelle to take action as she runs straight ahead. A moment later, the powerful form of a male lion flashes past you. Although being part anthro, the large feline chooses to bound after her on all fours with neck breaking speed.";
	say "     [bold type]Just having explored that fork of the way a short while ago, you remember that it soon ends in a tunnel blocked by some sort of hardened goop. There is no escape for the fleeing gazelle that way![roman type][line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Run after the two of them. You want to see how this turns out - or maybe do something...";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Get out of here while the lion still busy. You don't want to be his next prey after her.";
	if player consents: [go after them]
		LineBreak;
		say "     Hurrying after the gazelle and lion, you're just in time to see him corner her at the blocked tunnel end, pouncing on the helpless anthro. The muscular lion is on top of her in a second, pinning the lithe woman to the ground and giving her a very wide smile with his tooth-filled muzzle. 'P-please don't eat me!' she whimpers in fright, futilely struggling against his strong paw-hands that hold her. The lion chuckles in a deep voice, then brings his head down to her neck, opening his muzzle wider and wider... only to follow that up with just a playful lick before pushing himself up again. 'Never said I was gonna - but I might eat you out if you're a good girl,' the feline predator tells his captive.";
		say "     Pulling the gazelle's arms above her head, he holds her wrists with one hand, freeing the other to cup her petite breasts. 'Oh. Ooooohhhh!' comes the reply of the young woman, surprise audible in her voice as she realizes that her captor isn't the bloodthirsty type after all. As he licks her breasts and gives the lightest of nips to one nipple, then the other, her panic melts away, the herbivore no longer trembling in fear under the bulk of the lion. Soon, the gazelle loses her will to escape as her body clearly can't help but respond with arousal to the licks and caresses he gives her. The lion seeing this, soon lets go of her wrists, shifting his focus from holding his prize and more towards passionately pleasing her.";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]Well, this situation doesn't seem as dire as you first thought. Given what else is going on all over the city, the thought rises in your mind that you shouldn't try to interfere in this 'chase with happy ending'. Playing sex police is a fool's errand anyways. After a moment, you decide to:[roman type][line break]";
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Watch what happens next. A large, muscular lion mating a pretty female gazelle, that's something you don't see every day...";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Get out of here.";
		if player consents: [watch]
			LineBreak;
			say "     With the urgency taken out of the situation, you take your time to study the two entwined anthros in detail. On top is the lion, a proud specimen with golden fur shining in the light. His coat, short enough to allow you to clearly see the rippling muscles of his body, makes it undeniable that this is one strong kitty. Between his legs lies a thick erection, which bears numerous soft spines along its length, promising quite an experience for anyone mating with the feline. A handsome face with a confident expression and a large mane of brown fur completes the image of this king of the savanna. Below the lion, trembling in lust now that he is caressing and teasing her body, the beautiful gazelle is stretched out on the ground.";
			say "     Her body fits the typical image of a flight animal, lithe and thin, built for impressive bursts of speed to get away from any attacker - which she would have, in an open area without dead ends like this. The young woman's coat of short fur is brown on most of her shapely body, with a black streak running down the sides of her chest to divide her breasts and flat stomach from the rest, having a creamy white color instead. This draws attention to her small but perky breasts and the slit of her pussy further down, the fur around that already looking a bit matted from how wet the situation makes her.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Eyes closed, with her head raised at the end of her long gazelle neck, she lets out loud moans, readily accepting what the male on top of her does to wind her up. Then suddenly, he kisses her on the muzzle, making the horned woman open her eyes in surprise... and reply in kind, making out with her captor. As she moans into his mouth and slides her arms around his maned neck to hold on, the lion aligns his erection with the white landing strip of her belly fur, placing the head of his cock right at the start - directly above the herbivore's pussy.";
			say "     With a growl of arousal reverberating in the depths of his broad chest, the lion slides himself into his much smaller partner, overwhelming her with the sheer girth of his manhood. The young woman holds on for dear life as he sinks himself into her depths, stretching that pussy wide and soon making her belly bulge a little with the visible outline of his prick. 'Nnnnghh! Nice and tight,' the lion roars loudly as he bottoms out, while his partner is still simply panting and making animalistic sounds of lust. He keeps his body still for a moment to give her time to adjust, meanwhile licking the gazelle's neck again and kissing her.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The period of grace for the gazelle doesn't last all that long - not with a horny lion having his dick squeezed by her stretched pussy and soon reaching the end of his restraint. As he proceeds to pull his cock out of her most of the way, the slender herbivore gasps loudly - no doubt from the sensations of his nubby spines rubbing her inner passage. 'Do you like that?' he asks with a grin, giving a shallow thrust and withdrawing once more. 'Yeeeesssss, oh GOD! Fuck me!' she replies, her fingers digging into his mane as she trembles in lust.";
			say "     Laughing at the very enthusiastic exclamation of consent, the lion starts pounding his smaller partner relentlessly, one arm wrapped around her chest, the other cupping her ass to pull her up against his deep thrusts. There is something animalistic about their mating - as one would expect from an anthro gazelle and lion - and the two of them fill the area with loud moans, growls, roars and lust-filled shouts as they buck against each other. It is a wild ride for the gazelle to be fucked by the powerful feline on top of her, culminating with him driving himself deeply into her and letting lose a deluge of cum right into her womb. You can literally see each throb of seed arriving in her belly, as it swells up a little bit more each time.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Soon the outline of the lion's cock isn't even visible anymore, as she swells up far enough to have what looks like a baby bump. The two of them keep panting and holding on to each other for a long time while he keeps shooting more and more cum into her. Then eventually, the gazelle starts to loosen her death-grip on his mane, slowly at first until she is sure he'll keep holding her against his chest. She slides her hand down over her body to bring it to rest against the curve of her stomach, stroking over it gingerly. 'I - it's... my fertile time,' she says hesitantly and looks the lion right in the eye.";
			say "     'I know,' he replies, giving her a grin and licks the young woman's muzzle. 'What did you think drew me to your herd? So many of you, in season together - when the wind turned, how could I NOT go after that? Especially such a sexy little beast like yourself.' Kissing her deeply, he then lowers the young woman to the floor, gently pulling his prick from her depths. Kneeling over her, the lion puts his large paw-hand on her belly and just lets it rest there for a moment. Then he adds, 'Someone has been a VERY good girl indeed. I think you deserve a reward.' With that, the large male pulls her hips up and hooks the gazelle's legs over his shoulders, bringing his muzzle right between her thighs.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The first long lick pushes the slender herbivore to let out an aroused gasp, followed by many, many more as her captor starts to eat out her pussy. But not only that, he also puts a finger on her clit and rubs it in circling movements, driving her closer and closer to her own climax. Then she can't hold it in anymore and with a loud gasp, the gazelle trembles in his grasp, leaking cum and femcum that he happily licks off her crotch. The lion gives her time to ride out her orgasm, then gently lowers her to the ground. After a little while of catching their breaths, the two of them stand up again. He helps her to her feet as she seems a bit out of balance with the currently quite large belly.";
			say "     Making sure she's standing securely, he lets go from lightly gripping her upper arm, then steps back a little and clears his throat. 'By the way - I'm Gavin,' he tells her, giving a charming smile. Swallowing visibly, the gazelle looks at him, then down to her belly, then back at him again. Learning the name of the guy who fucked her somehow seems to make things all the more real - more than just a typical bump and grind... so she hesitates for a long moment before replying, 'Hannah. It's... nice to meet you?'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Silence stretches out between them for a few seconds more after that, then he offers her his paw-hand and says, 'Sorry about driving away your herd. They're long gone now, so it'd be dangerous to go out and search for them alone. How about you stay with me instead?' She looks at his large paw and the claws on it with big eyes, then hesitantly takes it, sliding her own hand into his. The two of them start walking out of the dead end after that, immediately noticing you as you kinda drifted closer and closer when you watched them have sex. Hannah is rather shameful at having been observed, while Gavin just grins and says, 'Hope you liked the show.'";
			say "     With that they stroll past you, hand in hand, and soon are out of sight. Despite the rather unconventional start of their relationship, and the fact that they're totally different species, it seems the two of them are actually a good fit. What will come out of their mating is anyone's guess though - a litter of lion cubs, or gazelles, or something in between. No matter what, you have a feeling their mother will care for them lovingly, and be more than ready to spread her folds again for the proud lion that fathered her children.";
		else: [leave]
			LineBreak;
			say "     Trying to tune out the moans and aroused whimpers from the gazelle, as well as her lion captor's growls, you turn around and walk away. Even so, the nose you hear behind you makes it quite clear that the two of them are having quite a good time. You can't help but wonder what might result from their mating - a litter of lion cubs, or gazelles, or something in between. No matter what, you have a feeling their mother will care for them lovingly, and be more than ready to spread her folds again for the proud lion that is fathering her children right as you think those very thoughts.";
	else: [make a getaway]
		LineBreak;
		say "     Trying not to listen to the frightened shouts, roars and growls coming from the direction both of the beast-people ran off in, you quickly walk the other way. One redeeming fact (maybe?) is that the noise goes on and on, so you don't think the predator went after the gazelles for food. Flashes of what might be going on between them instead dominate your imagination until you finally are out of earshot.";

Jungle Chase is a situation.
The sarea of Jungle Chase is "Zoo".

Instead of resolving a Jungle Chase:
	say "     Walking along the pathways of the zoo, you find yourself in an area overgrown by a lot of tropical plants. Between the towering trees, broad-leafed bushes and plants, colorful flowers, countless ferns and even vines hanging down from above, you get the feeling that you're walking through a jungle and not simply a footpath in the middle of a large city. The zoo really is quite expansive, and if there weren't some glimpses of buildings between the greenery here or there, you could almost believe you were somewhere in the Indian rainforest right now. Admiring the diverse environment around you, a loud and angry roar suddenly shakes you out of your reverie - it sounds fairly close too, and is quickly getting louder! Your eyes frantically search the area before you see that the path you're on forks about a dozen feet ahead, one way soon ending at the thoroughly barricaded door of a zoo building, the other being where the noise is coming from.";

Moments later, an interesting sight appears: a completely naked young human dashes past, angling his steps towards the barricaded building. At first glance he almost seems a boy, being of a quite slender and lean physique, but one look at the clearly adult manhood dangling between his legs dispels that impression quickly. Eyes glued to the scene, you realize that he isn't fully human, either. While having a human body, cute features and long black hair, as well as sun-bronzed skin, the young man's fingers and toes end in somewhat elongated claw-like nails, and a fuzzy black tail stretches out from the small of his back. In close pursuit of the boy, a large tigertaur comes into view, spitting in obvious anger as she bares her fangs.";

You have barely had a chance to begin wondering if you should do something about the situation when the hybrid youngster snatches up a liana hanging from above and starts to climb. Shimmying his way up the rope-like plant, he reaches one of the wide-spreading branches of a large tree within seconds. The tail on his body obviously is a great help as he then dashes along the branch,with it waving back and forth over his tight ass, assisting in his balance. Several quick steps later, he takes a forward leap from the tree, catching the edge of a high-up opening in the wall of the building. Looks like it was once covered by a ventilation grate and is fairly small in size. Yet before your unbelieving eyes, the young man contorts his body to actually fit through an opening not much more than a foot square.";

Seething in fury, she shouts up at him, 'I'll get you eventually, little bastard! And then you'll wish you hadn't angered me like this!' Laughter echoes back from above, and with the words, 'If you say so, Sheera...' the hybrid male vanishes from sight. While they were talking, you yourself have slowly backed away and hid behind a nearby tree - meaning that when she turns around to find an alternate target for her frustrations, you're thankfully out of sight.

Everything feels very [italic type]alive[roman type] here and you actually just stand still for a moment to take in the beauty of your surroundings.

Somehow, you can't help but feel curious about what exactly it might actually be. Eager to find out, you quickly follow one path leading in the right direction, soon reaching a bend that brings you into sight of the source of all this noise. There is a female tigertaur not too far ahead, pinning a hunky male zebra to the grass on a small meadow between tropical trees. She is holding him down while at the same time pumping her rear end up and down on his equine member.

The muscular male wears nothing but a blue baseball cap that reads 'City Zoo' on its front.

You recognize Barnabas and Malakhi, the anthro panther zookeeper and his panther-hybrid intern, taking turns washing themselves under a tiny waterfall that feeds the water barrier after a dozen feet of an artificial brook.

'Let's get you dry, my boy,' Barnabas tells him in a caring tone, shaking out a large towel and wrapping it (and his arms) around the younger male, rubbing Malakhi dry from head to toe.

Lithe legs wrap around the black-furred male, hooking over each other as Malakhi positions himself to cling to his trainer - or maybe trainee, in this case.
