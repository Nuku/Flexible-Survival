Description of Bargain Bin is "     This large bin seems filled with a number of small packets, bottles, and charms, boxes, pieces of fabric and who knows what else. You can't even see the bottom of it. Certainly an interesting opportunity to find... something in there. Above the bin someone has posted a recently drawn sign reading, 'Bargain Bin. Pay and draw one item out. Price: One packet of food and one bottle of water. No returns and refunds!' You aren't exactly sure just how much of a bargain this bin really is right now, but you could still find something useful right? Maybe you should try [link]hunt[as]sort Bargain Bin[end link]ing a bargain, or [link]sort[as]sort Bargain Bin[end link]ing through the bin?".

the linkaction of Bargain Bin is "Possible Actions: [link]smell[as]smell Bargain Bin[end link], [link]sort[as]sort Bargain Bin[end link][line break]";

the scent of bargain bin is "The bargain bin smells like omens and mysteries... at a discount price.".

Several days later when your former doll picks you up and sets you on a shelf, you realize that you have actually become a doll version of yourself, while the other doll lives your old life! You try to struggle and tell someone what has happened, but your size and cuteness means no one takes you seriously, not that you have much luck even talking to them either... soon though you begin to wonder what the point in trying is, it's so much easier to just go with the flow and do what your large master does, like a good little mimicking doll...";
