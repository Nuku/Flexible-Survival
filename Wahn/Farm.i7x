McDermott Farm Entrance	"McDermott Farm Entrance"

McDermott Farm Entrance is a room. It is a fasttravel. It is private.
The description of McDermott Farm Entrance is "     You're standing at entrance of a mid-sized farm, on the cracked asphalt that's left of a road leading here. Seems almost like the nanites enhanced grass to actively seek out and grow into and through human works to destroy them. Or at least try to - things on the other side of the long fence dividing the farm from the rest of the plains look pretty intact - which might have something to do with the two anthro horses with scythes you see working their way along, cutting down any sign of encroaching creeping grass. A sign on the archway over the road tells you that this is the 'McDermott Farm', in existence since 1792.".

Instead of sniffing McDermott Farm Entrance:
	say "     The scent of freshly cut grass hangs in the air.";

Open Grassland is a door. "Beyond the archway forming the entrance of the McDermott Farm, wide open grassland stretches out into the distance. Not as far as the eye can see, but nevertheless covering a significant area of what once was part of the city. The creeping grass sure was relentless in destroying buildings wherever it could spread.".
Open Grassland is south of McDermott Farm Entrance and north of Wandering the Plains.
Open Grassland is dangerous.
the marea of Open Grassland is "Plains".

To the north you can see a fenced paddock, to the east a fairly large milking shed and between them a path that leads to the northeast. Finally, to the south is the archway that marks the entrance to the farm and through which you could leave again.".

There is a whole row of milking stalls in here, all of them equipped with tubes and suction apparatuses. From one of the back rooms, the sound of a running generator is audible, explaining why the machines in here still work, contrary to the usual state of things in the city. Currently, there are several cows in various stalls, mooing contently from time to time as the pressure of the milk in their udders is being reduced.";

Several farm-workers are always present, for the main part anthro horsemen, though most don't seem to be all that talkative, coming here to rest and sleep after long hours battling the encroaching nanite-enhanced grassland. It looks like there's lots of unused room and empty beds in here - with these barracks being laid out for the number of people working in harvest time and currently only the base crew of permanent farm hands here.";

Strangely, he seems to be the only one that did grow especially fast, with all the other little horses still small children.

	say "     As you move to open the gate to the horse paddock, someone calls out to you, making you turn and look. It is a horseman, clearly one of the farm workers, who casually strolls over to you with a bundle of... something on his shoulder, consisting of lots of sturdy leather straps and buckles. Soon, he comes to stand before you on his broad hooves and gives you a calculating grin. 'Hey there, partner. Name's Lee. I saw you making all buddy buddy with Lucifer in there. You're a brave one, that I have to admit. Lots of others tried and ended up as mares right quick. There's a betting pool how long you'll last, just you know.' Looking you up and down as if to evaluate your body's willingness to transform, the horseman gives a knowing nod, then focuses back on your face. 'Anyhow, I got a proposition for you. Since you're so friendly with the big bad stallion, I'll offer you this thing for a low, low price. Hell, I'll even play pit crew if you need me to,' Lee explains, pulling the leather harness from under his arm and spreading it out for you to see.";
	say "     It looks like... a sex sling, with a sturdy leather pad on which to lie, plus very long leather straps, arranged so they can fit a broad barrel shape. You study the arrangement for a few seconds, then your eyes go wide in realization and you glance to the horses out on the paddock's green grass. 'Exactly,' the farmhand says, smiling broadly. 'You see, we had a... horse enthusiast, coming over sometimes before everything went to hell like this. At night, or when the boss was off for a few days, you know. For the right price, me and a few of the guys allowed him to have his fun, strapped him in. The guy had been waiting for a chance to try the new stud, but with everything going on...' Lee waves at his own horseman body and the entrance of the farm, beyond which you can see the creeping grass move in waves that have nothing at all to do with wind.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Lee goes on to say, 'I don't think he'll be back. So here I got this harness, and you could be the one to use it now... if you catch my drift. Come on, we both know you wanna get it on with Lucifer. Won't even have to pay me much for the harness and my help. Cash's useless anyways these days, so I'll do it if you get me something. Strands of hair from a centaur mare. I - got plans for that stuff.' Glancing over towards the barracks and barn, a lewd smile plays over Lee's face, then he pats your shoulder and says, 'Think about it, will ya? I'll keep an eye out and you just wave me over if you're in the paddock and wanna get your fun on with this baby.' He pats the harness and tucks it under his arm, then strolls off, leaving you to enter the paddock on your own.";
