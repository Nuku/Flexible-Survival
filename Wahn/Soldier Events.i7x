		say "     While exploring the second floor of an abandoned building in the city, you hear voices through one of the open windows. Peeking outside carefully so you're not spotted, you see five armed soldiers move through the alley behind the building. They're alert, but mostly keep their gaze level, observing what's in front of and behind them and not really looking up. Thus you can easily overhear them chatting with one another. 'Did you see the boobs on that last one? That's what I call a handful, eh Carl?!' one black-haired guy among the men jovially exclaims, nudging the blond soldier next to him. 'Yeah, maybe - but when she rubbed up against me, I felt something else beneath that skirt...' The first soldier snorts and says in a smarmy tone, 'There's always ass to have, even if you run into a t-girl!' Carl raises an eyebrow and shakes his head, 'We're not supposed to start things with civilians, Allen!' The first soldier shrugs and replies, 'It's not like we can catch anything, and she was literally begging for it.'";

			say "     A third soldier with a completely shaved head says, 'Too weird for me, to make out with some sort of freak. Like going to the circus and smooching the bearded lady, eh?' Allen chuckles and looks over to him, 'Yeah, I can see that it'd be odd for you, Burt. Visiting your sister when she's on show and Frenching her, haha!' The other man shows him the middle finger for the stupid joke, though he and the group do laugh about it - all except the one at the end of their marching line, who seems to be in some sort of distress. 'Man, it's hot today,' the pale-skinned man says to no one in particular, pulling on the collar of his uniform. You're a little surprised by this, as today is actually on the cooler side for the city, with a light breeze blowing from the sea. Sweat is running down over the man's face in visible beads, and he takes a deep, thirsty swig from his canteen. 'Really, fucking hot!' After pouring the rest of the water over his head, he flings the container aside, at which point the other men all turn to check on him.";
			say "     'What's up with you, Private Davies?!' Allen calls out, stepping up to the other man and grabbing him by the shoulder. 'Nnghh, feels like I'm burning inside, Sarge!' the distressed soldier groans, then shakes off the hand and starts to strip, dropping his weapon and backpack, followed by his jacket, then the olive tank-top covering his chest. This reveals the source of his discomfort - gray-white fur is rapidly sprouting from his skin, spreading in a slow but unstoppable wave over his front. Davies stares down at himself in shock, then falls to the floor, twitching and contorting himself in unnatural ways. The members of his squad watch in horror as the sounds of breaking and reforming bones echo in the alley, accompanied by groans and incomprehensible sounds from the transforming man. The other four soldiers become a weapon-bristling knot as they look first at each other for further infection, then all around in search of attackers. You quickly pull your head back, hoping that they didn't spot you.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Shit, what's going on?! Did those freaking nanite things evolve and overcome our boosters?' one man says, you think Carl. Then another throws in, 'Are we all going to end up like that? I didn't sign up to become some sort of monster!' 'Fuck no,' Burt adds to that, followed by a moment of overlapping voices saying things at the same time and which you do not understand. Then Allen cuts through the chaos with a shout, 'Shut the fuck up guys! Any of you feeling hot or weird? Carl? Burt? Ezra?' 'No sir!' Carl replies, with the other two men adding their own 'No!' right after. 'Okay, keep back while I check on him!' For a moment, you hear nothing but the transforming soldier's groans, then there's something else - a zipper? 'Oh, damn - did this stupid thing malfunction?' He pauses, then shouts, 'Soldiers, calm down! It's no new strain or attack - looks at this!' You peek down over the windowsill, seeing the men lower their weapons as Allen pulls out a bright red device from the dropped backpack and holds it up to them.";
			say "     'Remember that scientist guy telling us these autoinjectors would be easy and nothing can go wrong?' Allen growls, pointing at the fill indicator. 'There's six shots left, and he should have only five!' He presses a button on the side of the syringe and there is a low mechanical sound from it, with a little needle sliding out of the applicator end. 'Yeah, nothing came out right now. It's still at six! Check your own, right now!' All of them hastily scramble to dig out the injectors from their backpacks. While the men are busy, you take a quick glance over to Davies, who currently is in a rather gruesome phase of re-forming his head and face, accompanied by crunching sounds. Quickly looking away and trying to tune that out, you hastily focus on the soldiers instead, who are just calling out, 'I've got five! Me too! Yup, five here too!' Allen nods, sliding his own device back in the pack. 'Okay, looks like we're all fine. Davies is the only one who got a dud!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The men look startled and nervous, with Carl asking, 'How could this happen?!' Burt shrugs, 'Hell, with how suddenly this whole shit kicked off, I'm not surprised that these things were rushed through production. Not much sense in testing them for weeks and have em ready by the time we're already freaky monsters, I guess.' While the men talked, and you weren't looking too closely at Davies, the transformation of the infected soldier progressed further, now reaching the last stages. Within just a few more moments, he fully becomes a humanoid husky, with two pairs of breasts pushing out of his bared chest and jiggling under his movements. Or rather her movements, as Davies franticly kicks off the uniform pants covering her lower half, which is furry with digitigrade legs, and very much female. The pair of dog tags now resting between the rounded orbs of her breasts are left as the only sign that this was ever anything but a woman.";
			say "     'Can you believe how big those things got, and so fast?' Allen comments with a raised eyebrow, glancing up at the other men who're all watching the husky on the ground now. A paw-hand flies down to her crotch, as if frantically trying to find the cock that has shrunk away to little but the nub of a clit. While doing so, she rubs it with her fingertips and lets out a surprised, aroused groan. This seems to awaken something in the newly created female, drawing her to rub her clit harder, then escalating to slipping two fingers between her nether lips and exploring the opening of her pussy. The other hand quickly joins in, groping over her chest, caressing breasts and pinching nipples as she moans and pants. Carl edges closer leerily, looking down, and exclaims, 'Fuck, fuck, fuck! What are we supposed to do now? Think it'll make a difference if we inject him now?' His squad leader Allen comes up and crouches down next to Davies, bringing his own injector up to her neck and pressing it against the furred flesh. There is a hissing sound as it delivers its contents into the anthro husky's bloodstream.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			project Figure of Davies_pinup_icon;
			say "     Surrounding Davies, the men watch her with bated breath, hoping for... something, which doesn't seem to want to come. The husky just continues to writhe on the ground, fingers buried in her pussy as she pleasures herself with almost mindless focus on her own desires. 'Not happening, I guess. But daaammn, look at him go!' Ezra grunts, 'So, uhm... what-' At this point he is interrupted by the sound of someone laughing - an anthro bulldog that you can see at the front end of the alley. 'Knew I smelled something good in here,' the newcomer calls out, baring his teeth aggressively as he sniffs the air. 'One wet and ready bitch and some humans who'll be some too when I'm done!' The muscular brute steps forward, only to freeze in motion as the four soldiers raise their weapons in unison, taking aim at him. 'Err, just kidding,' the bulldog grunts, slowly backing away, then vanishing behind the corner when he's far enough back.";
			say "     'What the fuck do we do now? He - err... his scent is getting pretty strong. Even I can smell that, and I'm not some sort of bloodhound furry! Gonna draw any horny infected for a block or two downwind!' Ezra muses. Carl raises an eyebrow at the other man and asks, 'What'd you say? What's a furry?' Ezra blushes a bit, just shaking his head and ignoring the question. Having more important things to worry about, Carl quickly moves on to offer, 'We can fight our way back to the blockade. Just gotta keep it together and be ready for em, then...' Allen silences him with a raised hand, 'Not a chance. Look at her - one of us would need to carry the bitch! Also, we got a mission to fulfill! And even if we got her back, drooling and rubbing herself like this, the best Davies can hope for is being prodded by the eggheads for the rest of her life!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Scrunching up his features in dismay, Carl exclaims, 'Sir, he's not a bitch! We can't just leave him like this! He's still one of us!' 'Not saying we will, soldier! Here's the new plan: Alpha Team, minus Davies, will continue towards the current objective and check it out, while I take her to one of those abandoned houses we passed a block back. Remember the ones with the light yellow walls? Third in the row. She shouldn't be drawing quite as much attention without her scent being blown all over the place by the wind.' A panted yip of from between the men draws everyone's gaze downwards, where Davies is just having a messy orgasm, femcum squirting and dripping onto the ground. Some semblance of focus comes back to the husky's eyes for a second, with her looking up to meet Allen's gaze. 'C-Can't stop Sarge!' Davies pants in a voice that still has a bit of a male tone to it. Seems like some internal changes haven't quite completed yet.";
			say "     Almost straight away after that, the husky immediately continues to pleasure herself at an almost unabated pace, building towards the next rush of getting off. Shaking his head, Allen looks to each of his men and then continues to say, 'Remember that most of the infected we've encountered weren't mindless. There must be an end to this at some point. She'll wear herself out and calm down, hopefully by the time you return and rendezvous with me at the house. Then we'll proceed together, meet up with Bravo Team and get out of the city, all of us. Everyone understand?' He looks from soldier to soldier, who nod, followed by them helping to pick up Davies and placing her into a one-armed fireman's carry over Allen's shoulder, leaving one hand free to hold his weapon. After that, Carl leads Burt and Ezra onwards, with Allen walking back the way they came, lugging his burden along even as Davies goes on to grind her crotch against his shoulder.";

				say "     You hurry to the entrance of the building you are in, stepping outside barely in time to catch a glimpse of where Allen is going. You track the soldier at a cautious distance for a few minutes, seeing the man threaten several passing people to keep their distance. Finally, he turns off the road to enter a run-down housing complex consisting of a number of buildings. Observing which one he picks, you slowly approach while making sure you're never in full sight of the front door or windows. Instead, you circle around the building and keep close to the wall, ducking under each window and barely peeking over its windowsill to catch a glimpse of the inside. One empty room, two, then you find them: It's a bedroom with a somewhat grimy king-size bed, on which Davies lies outstretched now, still happily rubbing her clit. Glancing a bit to the side, you catch sight of Allen, who's put a chair in one corner of the room and is watching both the husky as well as the door leading into the room. His rifle is leaned against the wall right next to him.";
				say "     The window you're peeking through isn't actually fully shut, instead having about half an inch of an opening through which you can listen to what's going on in there fairly well, and smell the heady musk of canine arousal that must be insanely thick in the room itself. For a long while, most of what you hear are the schlicking sounds of Davies's fingers frigging her pussy and the husky's varied yips and pants as she pushes herself to sate the need the transformation instilled in her. Allen appears to be just silently watching her the whole time, gaze focused on the horny anthro that was one of his subordinate soldiers not so long ago. After the husky comes one more time, adding further to the wet spot on the mattress, she finally seems to calm down, sinking back onto the bed and just panting for breath with her eyes closed. As Allen brushes a hand through his black hair, then gets up to check on her, you notice that the man has a hardon in his pants, clearly outlined under the fabric it is straining against. Seems like having a ringside seat all this time had an impact on him.";

Snapping her eyes open, the husky raises herself up on her elbows, looking at him with surprise on her face. 'Sarge! What's -' the transformed soldier starts to say, only to pause and scrunch up her face, trying to stare at her own muzzle with crossed eyes, followed by closing one eye, then the other, and reaching up to touch the muzzle with one paw-hand. 'Oh fuck!' she curses, looking at her own hand and the paw-pads and blunt canine claws on it. 'I - I remember feeling hot, but then, then... god I was almost out of my mind! It felt like I had to, to... be filled. Kinda was burning inside me, and even now, I - it's as if I'm empty inside!' Allen grunts, bending over the bed and letting his gaze travel over the multiple breasts of the husky, then down to her crotch. The man stares at Davies's slick pussy as he says, 'That's because you're a bitch now, a bitch in heat. Just like Laika!' His voice starts out strangely hollow, then becomes almost manic towards the end.";
					say "     Davies looks up in confusion, 'Huh? Who?' Allen glances up for just a second, then goes back to staring at the husky's crotch, 'Oh, she was our family pet when I was a teen. Didn't have her spayed, so she went into heat too. That poor girl suffered and whined for days as we kept her locked up. Finally clawed her way through the lower half of our back door to get out, her need was so strong! But it got all better after I found her in the midst of a pack of neighborhood dogs, fighting over who got to take her next. It's just what a bitch needs, you see. Really a mercy!' Allen seems to be talking more to himself than to Davies, which the husky soldier also notices. 'Sarge, what's going on? Look me in the face!' The next sound you hear from inside the room is a zipper being pulled down, followed by the man pushing his pants and underwear down to his thighs. You catch a glimpse of a firm and muscled ass, pale-skinned and lightly dusted in short, black body hair. 'Wait, what are you doing? No! I'm a guy! You can't -' Davies starts to protest and tries to get up from the bed, only to have Allen pounce on her.";

					say "     Grabbing hold of Davies's transformed wrist that is raised in defense, Allen pushes her back down, shrugging off the husky's other arm as it attempts to grab him by the shoulder. 'Stupid Bitch!' Allen shouts at the scared woman before his tone suddenly shifts to a calm and comforting, as if he flipped a switch, 'Shh, be a good girl now. Don't make me punish you. I'm just trying to give you what you need.' Letting out a bark of shock and surprise, Davies replies, 'I'm not a woman, or a fucking dog! Let me go, you maniac!' She struggles desperately against the human, which isn't easy as she's worn out from the repeated orgasms, while he's at full strength and already on top of her. Attempts to kick the man are thwarted after only landing one or two glancing blows that at best leave some bruises, with Allen soon straddling one of Davies's thighs, his knee angled to push her other leg aside. He catches the soldier's other wrist and slams it down onto the mattress, holding Davies through her attempts to writhe out from under him. 'You want it, just admit that! You little slut! You humped against my shoulder the whole way as I carried you here!'";
					say "     During their struggle, the two of them moved around a little, giving you a fairly good viewpoint of what is going on. Allen is pinning his transformed subordinate, knees placed on top of her spread thighs and pressing them down, with his hands gripping her wrists tightly. The man's hard, uncut cock is rubbing against her flat, furry tummy as they move. The struggles of Davies soon weaken, with her being reduced to pleading and begging: 'No, sir! Please! Don't do this to me! I barely found my way back to being able to think again! If you -' Allen lets go of one of her wrists with one hand and gives the husky a punch in the side, seemingly knocking the wind out of her and allowing him to pin both wrists with the other hand. 'Stop making me do this to you, little bitch. Calm down.' Then he reaches down and rubs the sodden fur of Davies's crotch and hones in on her clit. Finding her pleasure-button lightly pinched and stimulated draws an unwilling moan from the bitch, followed by panting as her arousal soars yet again. Slipping three fingers over her sensitive nether lips and spreading them, Allen barks in a commanding tone, 'This is what you need! You wouldn't be so slick and dripping if that wasn't true!'";

While doing so, you hit an area that seems familiar, and the memory of what happened here before comes to mind: Not too far from where you stand, you ran into that squad of soldiers, one of which, a guy with the name of Davies, suddenly transformed into a husky bitch. Afterwards, the leader of the group, a sergeant named Allen, took Davies to an abandoned building nearby. He said it was to keep the newly created, intensely aroused bitch 'safe' while the rest of the men went to fulfill their mission, but either Allen had dark plans right from the get-go, or he changed his mind when finding himself alone with the bitch.

The men nod grimly and take position, weapons at the ready, while Allen taps Carl's shoulder and waves him into the building. Curiosity drives you forward once more, circling around the building out of sight of the men, then being careful as you approach the window of the bedroom again. Ducked out of sight, you overhear voices from within: '-been like this, or worse, the whole time. That infection really did a number on Davies,' Allen says. Carl replies, 'Shit! I'd hoped there'd be at least some improvement. I mean, a fair number of infected we run into seem relatively normal.' 'Yeah, no. Not in this case. Her heat is driving Davies close to the brink!

The man has fairly smooth skin, with barely any body hair visible, which might be because he's got blond hair.

He - uhm, we stopped at - you know, a porn shop. And Carl got one of those vibrator things, for Davies, if things get bad again. It's in his backpack.'";

'You think I didn't do everything I could think of to keep the bitch calm while you were - as it turns out - gallivanting about and looting civilian stores? Just some fingering or handing her a dildo isn't gonna cut it! There's only one thing that will truly satisfy her! A pup in that belly!' With him standing behind the other soldier, you're the only one who sees Allen rolling his eyes at the unexpected push-back from Ezra, forcing him to improvise on the fly[if Resolution of Soldier Squad is 93], which your friend is thankfully a master of. [else], which the loathsome psychopath can only do too well. [end if] 'And also... I wasn't going to mention it so you don't get a big head, but she's been fixated on you ever since you fucked her! Kept moaning your name as he orgasmed, and all that!' Blushing and looking at Davies's naked form, Ezra's mind is easily diverted, reaching out to put a hand on Davies's belly as he asks, 'Really? She wants me? Wants my kids?' A happy grin spreads over his face as Allen confirms the false truth.";

Between his obvious attraction to the anthro, the manipulation and fantasy being laid out before him, then a last push of someone giving him a stiff command, Ezra obeys right away. Whipping off his t-shirt and flinging it aside, he bares his lightly tanned chest with black, curly chest hair. Then the shorter man hastily pulls off his boots before half-rising to slide his pants down over his rear end. You can see he's rock hard, and must have been for a while, given that there's a wet spot at the bulge of his boxer briefs. With trembling hands, he hooks the fabric up and over his erection, then slides the fabric down his thighs. Looking at his intended partner, he slowly strokes up and down along his shaft a few times, before crawling up on the bed and moving into position between Davies's legs. She looks up at him with a bit of a vapid expression, then lets out a happy whine as he pushes her legs apart, fingers caressing the fur along her inner thighs.";

'Fuck, she's really wet!' he says excitedly, then spreads her nether lips apart, only to say in surprise, '...and full of cum?!' His face falls visibly as he realizes that his anthro bride, his promised mate, has been claimed by another, and recently too. 'Told ya I did what was needed,' Allen says, while lightly groping his own crotch, and faking a slightly apologetic expression on his face as Ezra looks at him. 'But even so, she just kept moaning for you! I could only tide her over for your return,' Allen throws out as a quick explanation, putting himself down to sell the story. And that's apparently good enough for the horny Ezra, who says to [if Resolution of Soldier Squad is 93]the bitch[else]the transformed soldier[end if], 'I'm here for you now, love!' With that said, he pushes his hips forward, sliding into her needy slit with a wet squelch, making Allen's seed splurge out around his shaft and soak the soldier's pubic hair.";

There's another male's cum, all around his erection, and now defiling his own skin. Still, the desire for Davies outweighs his discomfort, and he focuses solely on her, trying to push this blemish from his mind. Tail thudding on the mattress as her sexual needs are finally being met, Davies lets out happy pants, moans and soon barks as Ezra begins to rabbit-fuck her like a man possessed, all the while keeping his upper body pressed tight against hers. He pounds her hard and deep, all the while planting kisses on her muzzle, neck, breasts, then even suckling on one nipple or another before going back to making out with Davies again. The creak of bedsprings is almost constant now, as the two bodies of Allen's [if Resolution of Soldier Squad is 93]toy soldiers[else]manipulated victims[end if] cavort on the bed.";

Allen sits down on it, and gets back to watching the wild coupling of man and dog on the bed. It doesn't take all that long though before you can see something more than just sex begin to happen: A fine coat of fur is starting to spread over Ezra's crotch and legs, moving from the front of the thighs around the curve of the leg, likely following the splatter- and trickle-pattern of Allen's cum and Davies's female juices. With a flicker of a smile on his face, Allen looks at his watch and makes a quiet note of just how long it took for the start of the transformation to set in. Then he calmly pulls down his zipper, freeing the red rocket of his canine shaft and giving it a stroke.";

Meanwhile, the spreading fur sweeps down along the Ezra's legs and reaches his feet, at the same time as another wave of fur surges up through huskyfied man's ass, upwards to cover his back with grey and white fur. At that point, he seems to notice something is off, raising his head to look back - just in time to shockedly gape as a tail bursts out of his lower back, lengthening and expanding rapidly. The muscle spasm of that first major body change drives Ezra to hump into Davies yet again, which she takes as her queue to clamp her arms and legs around him, eager for the finale of their coupling.";

Not that she's not getting what she needs, as he's still within her and thrusting, if a bit uncoordinatedly as the sounds of crunching and reforming bones fill the room, together with Ezra's unintelligible shouts, and soon barks. After a slow start, it seems the nanites want to make up for lost time now, seemingly throwing everything and the kitchen sink at him, all at once. 'F - fff - Fuuuck! I'm a dog? I'm a dog!' Ezra manages to gasp after his new muzzle finally pushes out from his formerly flat face, sounding at first surprised, then increasingly excited. 'And I got... got a knot!' He pushes himself up a little, looking down to see her nether lips bulge out a little as he can't withdraw, due to the knot at the base of his erection swelling up inside her. 'Yeaahhh, I'm gonna knot you Davies!' The last words were shouted at the top of his lungs, followed by wildly grinding against her crotch, then bucking in wild spasms as he empties his balls into her.";

Then suddenly, he pushes himself up, both hands planted left and right of her panting body, and looks down his own front. His pecs are beginning to swell, showing some curves outward with the nipples growing in size too. Confused, Ezra says, 'Wait - this is so weird. My chest - and I'm all tingly, down at...'

Yet there is no help to be had from the man, as Ezra realizes when he sees Allen with his dick out, jerking it with actually increasing enjoyment as he watches his subordinate struggle. For all his desperation, the soldier can't resist the inevitable advance of the nanite transformation, and in the end, his pride and joy of a canine cock continues to shrink until it's just a somewhat oversized clit, on top of a triangular pussy. Of his balls, there is no trace at all. 'Noooo!' he wails, throwing himself back forward on top of Davies, wrapping both arms around her and burying his muzzle in the crook of her neck, sobbing. 'He lied, didn't he?! And I thought you wanted to be my mate. You and me, as a couple!' Davies instinctively hugs him back, making some soft comforting noises.";

Standing in the doorway is Carl, swaying a little and bleary-eyed, but awake enough to come investigate the racket and shouting in here. The first thing he sees is a (to him) unknown husky, on top of his squad-mate Davies, so he shouts, 'Hey, who the fuck are you, and how did you get in here?! Get off my friend!' He immediately rushes forward to wrench the sobbing and confused Ezra off Davies. Gripping the new husky bitch's upper arm, he pulls her up, inadvertently baring her breasts to him, as well as what's resting between those - a dog tag.";

The only reply is a desperate sob, mixed together with a needy, animalistic whine as the former male is hit hard by the new reality of his new, heat-wracked husky bitch body. More on autopilot than anything else, the transformed Ezra pushes her chest out, apparently trying to brush her breasts against Carl's hand. He lets go of the dog tag as if it was red-hot, pulling the hand away as he blurts out, 'Did - did Allen do this to you? How-' A harsh, amused voice interrupts him, as Allen barks out derisively, 'Took you long enough to figure it out.

Even so, the man keeps doing his best to resist, his spirit remaining strong even as his enemy has the upper hand. Then Carl fakes being beaten, and ready to give in, only to wrench himself away from Allen. This breaks [if Resolution of Soldier Squad is 93]your friend's [else]the sociopath's [end if]grasp, but as he's not fully in control of his own body, this makes Carl stumble and fall down.

But no, you always needed extra effort to handle, didn't you?' Grabbing the other man by the hair, Allen wrenches his up violently.

Hah, Burt's just another bitch for me, lying tied up with her pussy full of cum in one of the apartments!' Twisting Carl's head to the side to make him look towards the bed, Allen waves his hand towards the two huskies on it. 'Did you know that Davies actually got pregnant, and already produced a puppy? All the while you were out on a mission I gave you. And the four of you are going to be my breeding stock from now on! Swollen up like good little puppy mills!'";

Training hard, having the admiration of your subordinates, and the favor of the higher ups! I worked hard for my position, having to put on the right face to satisfy the often moronic expectations of superiors, and still haven't been promoted further than this! But you - you just roll through the ranks, getting commendations and whatnot! The captain even told me to keep an eye on you, because he 'saw something special in you'.' Snarling, Allen spits at Carl, 'We'll see what he says when he sees you after I'm done with you! Imagine his eyes going wide when I give a whistle, and like a trained dog you'll fall to your knees and pull his zipper down, then start lapping his dick like a fucking whore!

Done talking, Allen pounces on Carl, pushing down on the middle of his back to keep him down, while moving the other hand to the large hole in his pants. Feeling the man moving in on top of him seems to shake Carl out of his daze, and he begins to fight back, trying to get away from the other man, especially as Allen makes a grab for his white briefs. Despite the futile struggles, Carl's underwear is easy to tear apart for Allen, a sharp yank serving to do it quickly. The next thing he does is to line his canine shaft up with the pale-skinned rear end of his subordinate, then thrusts violently against Carl's asshole, only to not penetrate and slip between the man's buttocks instead.";

With a pain-filled scream from the blond man, Carl's virgin ass yields to the merciless invasion. Unable to keep Allen's husky cock out, his insides are stretched around the throbbing dickhead, opening the man up in a way he never felt before. Carl tries to claw and crawl away from what's hurting him, but Allen's keeping a firm grasp on his victim, pushing him to the ground as he gathers himself, then rams the rest of his cock in with a merciless thrust. With a choked scream, the pain is actually bad enough to make Carl pass out, leaving him in blissful oblivion to the brutal fuck that follows. While Allan said that he isn't exactly a fan of fucking a [italic type]man[roman type] in the ass, the tight hole around his cock, and the knowledge that he's subduing the last, and most troublesome, of his men does seem to keep Allen plenty hard while hammering into Carl.";

They apparently didn't even watch the fight, or its aftermath, instead turning to one another, touching and stroking. Currently, the two of them are curled against each other in a wild tangle of limbs, grinding their crotches together while panting like literal bitches in heat.

Looking down where his red rocket of a dog-cock is thrusting in and out of the other man, Allen withdraws fully, grinning in satisfaction as his erection slides out more and more, then whips up a little when the pointy tip slips past the rim of Carl's hole. Him inspecting his handiwork allows you a glimpse too, and all you can see through the large tear in Carl's pants is fur, no longer the pale skin of the man's buttocks.

As that doesn't seem to work, he then yanks his hips back violently, drawing a pained scream from Carl as the already mostly inflated knot is forced past his opening.

The man is reduced to whimpers and moans as his bones re-shape themselves with disturbing, crunching sounds. Meanwhile, Allen's transformation is more gradual, controlled by the man keeping himself on a diluted dose of infection blockers. For him, there seems to be something going on inside the camo pants that he's still wearing. You can see his boot slipping from where the man has braced against the floor to allow him to thrust hard into Carl, followed by Allen kicking out, which makes the combat boot dislodge from what no longer is a human foot but rather a paw.

This breaks the tension in Allen's body, making him fall back away from Carl as he feels spasms of transformation rock his body. Still, they're far less severe than with the man he just raped, as Allen lies on the ground and catches his bearings before rolling onto his back, then undoing his pants and shoving/kicking them off.

While you're still idly thinking about that, you hear another pair of footsteps in the distance, soon joined by the shout of, 'You can't run from me, bitch! I'll find you!

His muzzle starts to scrunch up in defiance, with the dog saying, 'No way, I'm my own -' You punch his nose before he's even done speaking. 'Ouch, hey! I -', he starts, but you raise your fist threateningly again, which finally shuts the guy up properly. Then you put him through his paces, treating the anthro like a dog in training, although you regularly have to underline your commands with new applications of strategic violence. He begs and rolls over, sitting and barking on command - which is made easier by his human intelligence, though harder by the defiance you're having to beat out of him.

Therefore you're not really surprised when grunts, growls and shouts echo out of a nearby alley, drawing your attention. Being the curious person that you are, you do a little sprint over to the opening of said alley and peek inside. The fight going on in the alley is between two anthro hyenas in leather jackets and a male soldier. As you stick your head around the corner, the muscular black guy just punches the first of his attackers right in the muzzle, sending her sprawling on the floor. This enrages the second hyena quite a bit, who throws himself on the soldier, earning him a painful punch to the side but also forcing the human into close-up wrestling to keep the hyena's gnashing teeth from his throat.";
	say "     You find yourself drawn into watching the muscular soldier struggle with his opponent - lots of punching, squeezing, scratching, biting, and even some groping from the hyena. This guy is clearly no novice to fighting and uses ALL weapons available to him - including the fact that the nanites override people's will to resist if they get horny enough. The conclusion of their fight is uncertain for a while - but eventually the soldier starts to get the upper hand as he manages to catch the canine's closed maw in grip. With the threat of being bitten momentarily removed, the human uses his handhold to twist back his enemy's head, then slams a shoulder into the anthro's chest to bull-rush him into the nearest wall. With a hollow thunk, the hyena's head impacts the bricks, after which his human opponent lets go, allowing the canine to crumple bonelessly to the floor. He is still alive, from what you can see - with the nanites, most wounds heal sooner or later after all - but surely out for the count.";

After a crunch from her freshly broken muzzle, the canine lets out a choked cry and passes out from the pain, crumpling on top of her already sprawled-out companion. Panting for breath, the soldier looks at the pile of hyenas and walks a few steps away, rapidly regaining his composure. 'You really saved my bacon,' he calls over to you and gives a thankful smile. Waving you closer, he adds, 'Glad to see some people are still on our side - instead of being such sex-crazed beasts.

Camo pattern pants, army boots and an olive colored backpack are the only other pieces of equipment on him, with all of them somewhat ripped and torn. Looks like he's had a rough time out here in the streets. His head is shaved bald, sweat glistening on the smooth black skin, and a friendly look greets you on his fairly attractive face.

Just ATE it, lock, stock, and barrel! But yeah - it wasn't that useful in that situation anyway - you can't just shoot everyone just because they're being driven crazy by this nanite shit!'

'Um - I know it's a bit of an odd request for someone you just met, but... could you check me out? I wanna know what's going on. Just give it to me straight!' With that, the man turns his back to you, holding up his shirt a little. You tell him what you see - a muscular back with smooth, sweaty black skin... and a few hairs of what looks like hyena fur sticking up above the waistband of his pants. He stiffens, straightening his back, then Monty's hands move to the front of his pants, undoing the button and zipper. He then pushes the camo pants down a little bit, slowly.";

'Thanks for... checking up on me. Even if you got a bit grope-happy in between.' The bald-shaven man looks at you and then gives a little snort, pulling the backpack from over his shoulder.";
				say "     'Guess I should give you a proper thanks, not just a wet handshake, eh? Here, take this.' Monty holds out a MRE and water bottle for you, nodding in a friendly way as you accept the items from him. Then he pats your shoulder again and says, 'Okay then, I think it's time to get going - make use of that quiet area you mentioned to get as far as I can. You watch out for yourself, alright?' With that, he marches off in the direction you came from, quickly turning around the nearby corner and moving out of sight.";

But contrary to what she seems to have expected, he isn't forced against the wall - instead, the man braces against the impact by tensing his muscular arms, stopping that part of the attack cold. Still, he's got an aggressive hyena hanging on his back now, clawing and trying to bite... so the guy does another unexpected thing - he grabs hold of her and keeps the hyena from letting go, then throws himself against the wall backwards. The impact drives the air out of his attacker's lungs, as does the next, and the next - and while the soldier does get clawed up a bit more, soon the hyena passes out and falls off his back, landing in a heap on her unconscious companion.";

After a short moment, he looks back to his attackers, nodding to himself that they're no longer a threat. Then the man suddenly turns his head and looks right in your direction! He must have caught a glimpse of movement from you in the corner of his eye. 'Fuck, another savage!' he swears loudly and clenches his fist - but only for a second before he winces and looks down at his bruised knuckles. Fist-fights against anthro animals sure are hard on a guy and even with the ever-present nanites, it'll take some moments before he heals... so the soldier chooses retreat over an uncertain fight. Without another word, he starts to run for the other end of the alley, leaving you far behind in mere moments. Then he's gone around the far corner, out of sight.";

Beyond the alley you are standing in, a solid block's worth of buildings has been flattened - through the use of explosives, from the scorched looks of it. Several excavators are actively moving around, pushing rubble to fill the caved-in roads. Seems like someone remembered that the sewers were also a possible access path and destroyed them through the use of more explosives. The question of who is doing all this is easy enough to answer, as there are numerous soldiers visible on the other side of this line cutting through the outer city. And not only that - there's a tank at a street-crossing a little ahead too!";
		say "     You are still contemplating maybe walking out of the alley and letting them take you in for quarantine or something, when a prerecorded message starts to blare from a series of set-up speakers: 'Please remain in your homes. A red-code quarantine is under effect. We will be forced to shoot at anyone approaching the containment zone.' Well, that's clear enough - you keep your distance and quietly wander back up the alley you are in. Seems like you'll have to survive within the city after all, with this easy out denied to you.";

Countless buildings have been demolished to create this open expanse, leaving little room for anything to approach unseen. An enormous contingent of troops stand guard upon the affected zone, ready to hold back any and all tries to break the quarantine - meaning that you won't be getting to safety this way. Staying outside the danger zone of where one is likely to be shot at by unrelenting soldiers, you watch the movements of patrolling men on the far side. They keep throwing watchful glances to the city and yourself.";

				say "     Suddenly, a gleeful shriek sounds out over the city, followed by the appearance of a [italic type]very[roman type] big wyvern that swoops in barely ten feet above the roofs all around you. The creature passes right over your position, allowing you to make out that it is a [one of]female[or]male[at random], and also clearly aroused by the wide range of prey it sees spread out ahead. As the beast starts to beat its massive wings to brake and land, the patrols begin to shoot at it, sending short bursts of bullets streaking towards the great reptile. Some do tear bleeding holes in the wyvern's skin, but most are deflected by the armored plates of its hide, and even the wounds that were inflicted start to close instantly, doing little but annoying it.";

				say "     Wading through the barrage of bullets, the creature snaps for the nearest soldier, forcing him to jump aside and flee. For a moment it seems like the wyvern is unstoppable, but the tide turns in an instant when another man raises a rocket launcher and takes aim. With a 'Whoosh', the missile flies straight at giant reptile. The wyvern has only a sliver of a second time before being hit - not enough to evade, but just fitting to interpose its arm/wing. Targeted with an anti-tank weapon, even the tough plating of its hide doesn't protect the attacking beast and its whole limb is torn apart in the resulting explosion, leaving a shredded mess of flesh and bone.";
				say "     With an almost eardrum-piercing shriek, the wyvern scrambles backwards. The stump of its wing closes up enough to stop bleeding within moments, but even so it is missing a whole limb right now. Further bullets are fired at it, amplifying the creature's suffering enough for it to call it quits for now. Huge claws dig deep grooves into the field of rubble that the soldiers have created as a free-fire range, with the earth shaking as the massive reptile flees. It jeers off course a bit, still reeling from the unexpected pain and its grievous wound, actually impacting the front of some buildings with one shoulder and sending showers of bricks raining down on the street. Then it catches itself and keeps going, vanishing into the expanse of the infected city.";

				say "     The tense men are distracted by something happening a little distance to your right. You hear the distant shouts of the men and see them sprinting over that way, so you lean out of the alley and have a glance. Looks like a small group of infected is just trudging out of the city, their clothes ragged and dirty. They are a mixture of species, but their movement suggests exhaustion. The sound of the pre recorded message warning about entering the cleared area reaches you and you notice the people shuffle around uncertainly, looking over their shoulders with fear and towards the military with hope draining from their bodies. They loiter for a moment, dreading returning to the conditions that have molded them into what they are now, but reluctantly accepting that they would be unlikely to survive crossing the stretch of cleared land.";

				say "     As most of them turn back towards the buildings, one of the smaller figures, [one of]a spaniel[or]a lynx[or]a fennec[or]a frog[or]a goblin[or]a feral husky[or]a gecko[or]a beetle[or]a chinchilla[or]a catboy[at random], begins to run towards the military, the desperation to escape whatever terrors they have faced in the city spurring them to risk death at the bullets of the machine guns. He is pursued by [one of]a pyrenean mountain dog[or]a black bear[or]a timber wolf[or]a tiger[or]a hulk of a man[or]a dragon[or]a badger[or]a minotaur[or]a gorilla[or]a hyena[or]a rhino[or]an alligator[at random] who tackles him into a dip in the ground just before a hail of bullets impacts against the earth above them. While you can't hear them, you see the larger anthro place a hand on the other's shoulder reassuringly before giving him a hug. They crawl out of the pit cautiously, back towards their fellow refugees. Now that they are moving away from the cordon, the soldiers watch them warily, but refrain from shooting. The ragged group stagger back into the city, huddled together and relieved at such a close brush with tragedy. Not wishing to cross the open area yourself, you too return to the relative safety of the city.";

Please present yourself at the entrance of the checkpoint.' The announcement has not even ended that packs of transformed survivors rush from their hiding spots towards the flattened no-man's land, towards one of the few buildings still left intact, for the military to occupy. Two squads of soliders stands watch in front of the habitation, ensuring that no one would trespass. On the other side, you see a truck parking under good escort.";

Hazmat-suit wearing workers get off the truck, carrying crates. The infected become agitated while the workers open the crates. They throw packs of food and clean water to the crowd, which goes into a frenzy over the limited supplies. Small scuffles break out in the large group, while the soldiers watch impassively on their side. You spot, safely hidden behind the windows of the bulding's upper floor, persons in labcoats, who seem observe the event from a safe distance, probably taking notes.";
					say "     Eventually, the distribution is over. The crowd clears, most people having managed to get some supplies, while others are walking away empty-handed and dejected.

You suddenly notice something unusual on your side: a [one of]rat[or]husky[or]fox[or]orc[or]gorilla[or]catboy[or]fennec[or]bear[at random] slips carefully from flattened building to broken walls of concrete, eventually posting himself into a destroyed store, of which only a corner wall remains. He flashes a light towards the soldiers, who head in his direction.";

After a moment spent haggling, the infected hands over a lumpy plastic bag in exchange. One of the soldiers takes it with care not to touch the person's hand, then pulls a bundle of bank notes from it to look at and nods. After some more discussions, the two groups part ways. The solider resume their patrol, as if nothing had happened, while the would-be black-market supplier goes back to where he came from, a stack of rations held in his arms.";
