Peeking outside carefully so you're not spotted, you see five armed soldiers move through the alley behind the building. They're alert, but mostly keep their gaze level, observing what's in front of and behind them and not really looking up. Thus you can easily overhear them chatting with one another. 'Did you see the boobs on that last one? That's what I call a handful, eh Carl?!' one black-haired guy among the men jovially exclaims, nudging the blond soldier next to him. 'Yeah, maybe - but when she rubbed up against me, I felt something else beneath that skirt...' The first soldier snorts and says in a smarmy tone, 'There's always ass to have, even if you run into a t-girl!' Carl raises an eyebrow and shakes his head, 'We're not supposed to start things with civilians, Allen!' The first soldier shrugs and replies, 'It's not like we can catch anything, and she was literally begging for it.'";

			say "     A third soldier with a completely shaved head says, 'Too weird for me, to make out with some sort of freak. Like going to the circus and smooching the bearded lady, eh?' Allen chuckles and looks over to him, 'Yeah, I can see that it'd be odd for you, Burt. Visiting your sister when she's on show and frenching her, haha!' The other man shows him the middle finger for the stupid joke, though he and the group do laugh about it - all except the one at the end of their marching line, who seems to be in some sort of distress. 'Man, it's hot today,' the pale-skinned man says to no one in particular, pulling on the collar of his uniform. You're a little surprised by this, as today is actually on the cooler side for the city, with a light breeze blowing from the sea. Sweat is running down over the man's face in visible beads, and he takes a deep, thirsty swig from his canteen. 'Really, fucking hot!' After pouring the rest of the water over his head, he flings the container aside, at which point the other men all turn to check on him.";
			say "     'What's up with you, Private Davies?!' Allen calls out, stepping up to the other man and grabbing him by the shoulder. 'Nnghh, feels like I'm burning inside, Sarge!' the distressed soldier groans, then shakes off the hand and starts to strip, dropping his weapon and backpack, followed by his jacket, then the olive tank-top covering his chest. This reveals the source of his discomfort - gray-white fur is rapidly sprouting from his skin, spreading in a slow but unstoppable wave over his front. Davies stares down at himself in shock, then falls to the floor, twitching and contorting himself in unnatural ways. The members of his squad watch in horror as the sounds of breaking and reforming bones echo in the alley, accompanied by groans and incomprehensible sounds from the transforming man. The other four soldiers become a weapon-bristling knot as they look first at each other for further infection, then all around in search of attackers. You quickly pull your head back, hoping that they didn't spot you.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Shit, what's going on?! Did those freaking nanite things evolve and overcome our boosters?' one man says, you think Carl. Then another throws in, 'Are we all going to end up like that? I didn't sign up to become some sort of monster!' 'Fuck no,' Burt adds to that, followed by a moment of overlapping voices saying things at the same time and which you do not understand. Then Allen cuts through the chaos with a shout, 'Shut the fuck up guys! Any of you feeling hot or weird? Carl? Burt? Ezra?' 'No sir!' Carl replies, with the other two men adding their own 'No!' right after. 'Okay, keep back while I check on him!' For a moment, you hear nothing but the transforming soldier's groans, then there's something else - a zipper? 'Oh, damn - did this stupid thing malfunction?' He pauses, then shouts, 'Soldiers, calm down! It's no new strain or attack - looks at this!' You peek down over the windowsill, seeing the men lower their weapons as Allen pulls out a bright red device from the dropped backpack and holds it up to them.";
			say "     'Remember that scientist guy telling us these autoinjectors would be easy and nothing can go wrong?' Allen growls, pointing at the fill indicator. 'There's six shots left, and he should have only five!' He presses a button on the side of the syringe and there is a low mechanical sound from it, with a little needle sliding out of the applicator end. 'Yeah, nothing came out right now. It's still at six! Check your own, right now!' All of them hastily scramble to dig out the injectors from their backpacks. While the men are busy, you take a quick glance over to Davies, who currently is in a rather gruesome phase of re-forming his head and face, accompanied by crunching sounds. Quickly looking away and trying to tune that out, you hastily focus on the soldiers instead, who are just calling out, 'I've got five! Me too! Yup, five here too!' Allen nods, sliding his own device back in the pack. 'Okay, looks like we're all fine. Davies is the only one who got a dud!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The men look startled and nervous, with Carl asking, 'How could this happen?!' Burt shrugs, 'Hell, with how suddenly this whole shit kicked off, I'm not surprised that these things were rushed through production. Not much sense in testing them for weeks and have em ready by the time we're already freaky monsters, I guess.' While the men talked, and you weren't looking too closely at Davies, the transformation of the infected soldier progressed further, now reaching the last stages. Within just a few more moments, he fully becomes a humanoid husky, with two pairs of breasts pushing out of his bared chest and jiggling under his movements. Or rather her movements, as Davies franticly kicks off the uniform pants covering her lower half, which is furry with digitigrade legs, and very much female. The pair of dog tags now resting between the rounded orbs of her breasts are left as the only sign that this was ever anything but a woman.";
			say "     'Can you believe how big those things got, and so fast?' Allen comments with a raised eyebrow, glancing up at the other men who're all watching the husky on the ground now. A paw-hand flies down to her crotch, as if frantically trying to find the cock that has shrunk away to little but the nub of a clit. While doing so, she rubs it with her fingertips and lets out a surprised, aroused groan. This seems to awaken something in the newly created female, drawing her to rub her clit harder, then escalating to slipping two fingers between her nether lips and exploring the opening of her pussy. The other hand quickly joins in, groping over her chest, caressing breasts and pinching nipples as she moans and pants. Carl edges closer leerily, looking down, and exclaims, 'Fuck, fuck, fuck! What are we supposed to do now? Think it'll make a difference if we inject him now?' His squad leader Allen comes up and crouches down next to Davies, bringing his own injector up to her neck and pressing it against the furred flesh. There is a hissing sound as it delivers its contents into the anthro husky's bloodstream.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Surrounding Davies, the men watch her with bated breath, hoping for... something, which doesn't seem to want to come. The husky just continues to writhe on the ground, fingers buried in her pussy as she pleasures herself with almost mindless focus on her own desires. 'Not happening, I guess. But daaammn, look at him go!' Ezra grunts, 'So, uhm... what-' At this point he is interrupted by the sound of someone laughing - an anthro bulldog that you can see at the front end of the alley. 'Knew I smelled something good in here,' the newcomer calls out, baring his teeth aggressively as he sniffs the air. 'One wet and ready bitch and some humans who'll be some too when I'm done!' The muscular brute steps forward, only to freeze in motion as the four soldiers raise their weapons in unison, taking aim at him. 'Err, just kidding,' the bulldog grunts, slowly backing away, then vanishing behind the corner when he's far enough back.";
			say "     'What the fuck do we do now? He - err... his scent is getting pretty strong. Even I can smell that, and I'm not some sort of bloodhound furry! Gonna draw any horny infected for a block or two downwind!' Ezra muses. Carl raises an eyebrow at the other man and asks, 'What'd you say? What's a furry?' Ezra blushes a bit, just shaking his head and ignoring the question. Having more important things to worry about, Carl quickly moves on to offer, 'We can fight our way back to the blockade. Just gotta keep it together and be ready for em, then...' Allen silences him with a raised hand, 'Not a chance. Look at her - one of us would need to carry the bitch! Also, we got a mission to fulfill! And even if we got her back, drooling and rubbing herself like this, the best Davies can hope for is being prodded by the eggheads for the rest of her life!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Scrunching up his features in dismay, Carl exclaims, 'Sir, he's not a bitch! We can't just leave him like this! He's still one of us!' 'Not saying we will, soldier! Here's the new plan: Alpha Team, minus Davies, will continue towards the current objective and check it out, while I take her to one of those abandoned houses we passed a block back. Remember the ones with the light yellow walls? Third in the row. She shouldn't be drawing quite as much attention without her scent being blown all over the place by the wind.' A panted yip of from between the men draws everyone's gaze downwards, where Davies is just having a messy orgasm, femcum squirting and dripping onto the ground. Some semblance of focus comes back to the husky's eyes for a second, with her looking up to meet Allen's gaze. 'C-Can't stop Sarge!' Davies pants in a voice that still has a bit of a male tone to it. Seems like some internal changes haven't quite completed yet.";
			say "     Almost straight away after that, the husky immediately continues to pleasure herself at an almost unabated pace, building towards the next rush of getting off. Shaking his head, Allen looks to each of his men and then continues to say, 'Remember that most of the infected we've encountered weren't mindless. There must be an end to this at some point. She'll wear herself out and calm down, hopefully by the time you return and rendezvous with me at the house. Then we'll proceed together, meet up with Bravo Team and get out of the city, all of us. Everyone understand?' He looks from soldier to soldier, who nod, followed by them helping to pick up Davies and placing her into a one-armed fireman's carry over Allen's shoulder, leaving one hand free to hold his weapon. After that, Carl leads Burt and Ezra onwards, with Allen walking back the way they came, lugging his burden along even as Davies goes on to grind her crotch against his shoulder.";

You track the soldier at a cautious distance for a few minutes, seeing the man threaten several passing people to keep their distance. Finally, he turns off the road to enter a run-down housing complex consisting of a number of buildings. Observing which one he picks, you slowly approach while making sure you're never in full sight of the front door or windows. Instead, you circle around the building and keep close to the wall, ducking under each window and barely peeking over its windowsill to catch a glimpse of the inside. One empty room, two, then you find them: It's a bedroom with a somewhat grimy king-size bed, on which Davies lies outstretched now, still happily rubbing her clit. Glancing a bit to the side, you catch sight of Allen, who's put a chair in one corner of the room and is watching both the husky as well as the door leading into the room. His rifle is leaned against the wall right next to him.";
				say "     The window you're peeking through isn't actually fully shut, instead having about half an inch of an opening through which you can listen to what's going on in there fairly well, and smell the heady musk of canine arousal that must be insanely thick in the room itself. For a long while, most of what you hear are the schlicking sounds of Davies's fingers frigging her pussy and the husky's varied yips and pants as she pushes herself to sate the need the transformation instilled in her. Allen appears to be just silently watching her the whole time, gaze focused on the horny anthro that was one of his subordinate soldiers not so long ago. After the husky comes one more time, adding further to the wet spot on the mattress, she finally seems to calm down, sinking back onto the bed and just panting for breath with her eyes closed. As Allen brushes a hand through his black hair, then gets up to check on her, you notice that the man has a hardon in his pants, clearly outlined under the fabric it is straining against. Seems like having a ringside seat all this time had an impact on him.";

					say "     Coming to stand next to the bed, Allen calls out, 'Hey Davies, can you hear me?' Snapping her eyes open, the husky raises herself up on her elbows, looking at him with surprise on her face. 'Sarge! What's -' the transformed soldier starts to say, only to pause and scrunch up her face, trying to stare at her own muzzle with crossed eyes, followed by closing one eye, then the other, and reaching up to touch the muzzle with one paw-hand. 'Oh fuck!' she curses, looking at her own hand and the paw-pads and blunt canine claws on it. 'I - I remember feeling hot, but then, then... god I was almost out of my mind! It felt like I had to, to... be filled. Kinda was burning inside me, and even now, I - it's as if I'm empty inside!' Allen grunts, bending over the bed and letting his gaze travel over the multiple breasts of the husky, then down to her crotch. The man stares at Davies's slick pussy as he says, 'That's because you're a bitch now, a bitch in heat. Just like Laika!' His voice starts out strangely hollow, then becomes almost manic towards the end.";
					say "     Davies looks up in confusion, 'Huh? Who?' Allen glances up for just a second, then goes back to staring at the husky's crotch, 'Oh, she was our family pet when I was a teen. Didn't have her spayed, so she went into heat too. That poor girl suffered and whined for days as we kept her locked up. Finally clawed her way through the lower half of our back door to get out, her need was so strong! But it got all better after I found her in the midst of a pack of neighborhood dogs, fighting over who got to take her next. It's just what a bitch needs, you see. Really a mercy!' Allen seems to be talking more to himself than to Davies, which the husky soldier also notices. 'Sarge, what's going on? Look me in the face!' The next sound you hear from inside the room is a zipper being pulled down, followed by the man pushing his pants and underwear down to his thighs. You catch a glimpse of a firm and muscled ass, pale-skinned and lightly dusted in short, black body hair. 'Wait, what are you doing? No! I'm a guy! You can't -' Davies starts to protest and tries to get up from the bed, only to have Allen pounce on her.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Grabbing hold of Davies's transformed wrist that is raised in defense, Allen pushes her back down, shrugging off the husky's other arm as it attempts to grab him by the shoulder. 'Stupid Bitch!' Allen shouts at the scared woman before his tone suddenly shifts to a calm and comforting, as if he flipped a switch, 'Shh, be a good girl now. Don't make me punish you. I'm just trying to give you what you need.' Letting out a bark of shock and surprise, Davies replies, 'I'm not a woman, or a fucking dog! Let me go, you maniac!' She struggles desperately against the human, which isn't easy as she's worn out from the repeated orgasms, while he's at full strength and already on top of her. Attempts to kick the man are thwarted after only landing one or two glancing blows that at best leave some bruises, with Allen soon straddling one of Davies's thighs, his knee angled to push her other leg aside. He catches the soldier's other wrist and slams it down onto the mattress, holding Davies through her attempts to writhe out from under him. 'You want it, just admit that! You little slut! You humped against my shoulder the whole way as I carried you here!'";
					say "     During their struggle, the two of them moved around a little, giving you a fairly good viewpoint of what is going on. Allen is pinning his transformed subordinate, knees placed on top of her spread thighs and pressing them down, with his hands gripping her wrists tightly. The man's hard, uncut cock is rubbing against her flat, furry tummy as they move. The struggles of Davies soon weaken, with her being reduced to pleading and begging: 'No, sir! Please! Don't do this to me! I barely found my way back to being able to think again! If you -' Allen lets go of one of her wrists with one hand and gives the husky a punch in the side, seemingly knocking the wind out of her and allowing him to pin both wrists with the other hand. 'Stop making me do this to you, little bitch. Calm down.' Then he reaches down and rubs the sodden fur of Davies's crotch and hones in on her clit. Finding her pleasure-button lightly pinched and stimulated draws an unwilling moan from the bitch, followed by panting as her arousal soars yet again. Slipping three fingers over her sensitive nether lips and spreading them, Allen barks in a commanding tone, 'This is what you need! You wouldn't be so slick and dripping if that wasn't true!'";

Her quartet of breasts jiggles with the movement, keeping the curly-haired soldier next to her enthralled. 'Go on, touch her. She needs the attention!'

Licking his lips, Ezra runs a fingertip over one of her nipples, smiling as she lets out a moan and pushes up against his touch.

'As much as she might like you touching her, that won't extinguish the fires of need burning in a bitch. She needs more!'

While we were out, Carl and I talked a bit about... things. Why we're here, and that we should be focusing on helping the infected. That we must never forget that they're people who need help.

Whipping off his t-shirt and flinging it aside, he bares his lightly tanned chest with black, curly chest hair. Then the shorter man hastily pulls off his boots before half-rising to slide his pants down over his rear end. You can see he's rock hard, and must have been for a while, given that there's a wet spot at the bulge of his boxer briefs. With trembling hands, he hooks the fabric up and over his erection, then slides the fabric down his thighs. Looking at his intended partner, he slowly strokes up and down along his shaft a few times, before crawling up on the bed and moving into position between Davies's legs.

His face falls visibly as he realizes that his anthro bride, his promised mate, has been claimed by another, and recently too. 'Told ya I did what was needed,' Allen says, while lightly groping his own crotch, and faking a slightly apologetic expression on his face as Ezra looks at him. 'But even so, she just kept moaning for you! I could only tide her over for your return,' Allen throws out as a quick explanation, putting himself down to sell the story. And that's apparently good enough for the horny Ezra, who says to [if Resolution of Soldier Squad is 93]the bitch[else]the transformed soldier[end if], 'I'm here for you now, love!' With that said, he pushes his hips forward, sliding into her needy slit with a wet squelch, making Allen's seed splurge out around his shaft and soak the soldier's pubic hair.";

Still, the desire for Davies outweighs his discomfort, and he focuses solely on her, trying to push this blemish from his mind. Tail thudding on the mattress as her sexual needs are finally being met, Davies lets out happy pants, moans and soon barks as Ezra begins to rabbit-fuck her like a man possessed, all the while keeping his upper body pressed tight against hers. He pounds her hard and deep, all the while planting kisses on her muzzle, neck, breasts, then even suckling on one nipple or another before going back to making out with Davies again.

Allen sits down on it, and gets back to watching the wild coupling of man and dog on the bed. It doesn't take all that long though before you can see something more than just sex begin to happen: A fine coat of fur is starting to spread over Ezra's crotch and legs, moving from the front of the thighs around the curve of the leg, likely following the splatter- and trickle-pattern of Allen's cum and Davies's female juices. With a flicker of a smile on his face, Allen looks at his watch and makes a quiet note of just how long it took for the start of the transformation to set in. Then he calmly pulls down his zipper, freeing the red rocket of his canine shaft and giving it a stroke.";

Meanwhile, the spreading fur sweeps down along the Ezra's legs and reaches his feet, at the same time as another wave of fur surges up through huskyfied man's ass, upwards to cover his back with grey and white fur. At that point, he seems to notice something is off, raising his head to look back - just in time to shockedly gape as a tail bursts out of his lower back, lengthening and expanding rapidly.

After a slow start, it seems the nanites want to make up for lost time now, seemingly throwing everything and the kitchen sink at him, all at once. 'F - fff - Fuuuck! I'm a dog? I'm a dog!' Ezra manages to gasp after his new muzzle finally pushes out from his formerly flat face, sounding at first surprised, then increasingly excited. 'And I got... got a knot!' He pushes himself up a little, looking down to see her nether lips bulge out a little as he can't withdraw, due to the knot at the base of his erection swelling up inside her.

Yet there is no help to be had from the man, as Ezra realizes when he sees Allen with his dick out, jerking it with actually increasing enjoyment as he watches his subordinate struggle. For all his desperation, the soldier can't resist the inevitable advance of the nanite transformation, and in the end, his pride and joy of a canine cock continues to shrink until it's just a somewhat oversized clit, on top of a triangular pussy. Of his balls, there is no trace at all. 'Noooo!' he wails, throwing himself back forward on top of Davies, wrapping both arms around her and burying his muzzle in the crook of her neck, sobbing.

Standing in the doorway is Carl, swaying a little and bleary-eyed, but awake enough to come investigate the racket and shouting in here. The first thing he sees is a (to him) unknown husky, on top of his squad-mate Davies, so he shouts, 'Hey, who the fuck are you, and how did you get in here?! Get off my friend!' He immediately rushes forward to wrench the sobbing and confused Ezra off Davies.

More on autopilot than anything else, the transformed Ezra pushes her chest out, apparently trying to brush her breasts against Carl's hand. He lets go of the dog tag as if it was red-hot, pulling the hand away as he blurts out, 'Did - did Allen do this to you?

This breaks [if Resolution of Soldier Squad is 93]your friend's [else]the sociopath's [end if]grasp, but as he's not fully in control of his own body, this makes Carl stumble and fall down.

But no, you always needed extra effort to handle, didn't you?' Grabbing the other man by the hair, Allen wrenches his up violently.

Hah, Burt's just another bitch for me, lying tied up with her pussy full of cum in one of the apartments!' Twisting Carl's head to the side to make him look towards the bed, Allen waves his hand towards the two huskies on it. 'Did you know that Davies actually got pregnant, and already produced a puppy? All the while you were out on a mission I gave you. And the four of you are going to be my breeding stock from now on! Swollen up like good little puppy mills!'";

I worked hard for my position, having to put on the right face to satisfy the often moronic expectations of superiors, and still haven't been promoted further than this!

Done talking, Allen pounces on Carl, pushing down on the middle of his back to keep him down, while moving the other hand to the large hole in his pants. Feeling the man moving in on top of him seems to shake Carl out of his daze, and he begins to fight back, trying to get away from the other man, especially as Allen makes a grab for his white briefs. Despite the futile struggles, Carl's underwear is easy to tear apart for Allen, a sharp yank serving to do it quickly.

Unable to keep Allen's husky cock out, his insides are stretched around the throbbing dickhead, opening the man up in a way he never felt before. Carl tries to claw and crawl away from what's hurting him, but Allen's keeping a firm grasp on his victim, pushing him to the ground as he gathers himself, then rams the rest of his cock in with a merciless thrust. With a choked scream, the pain is actually bad enough to make Carl pass out, leaving him in blissful oblivion to the brutal fuck that follows. While Allan said that he isn't exactly a fan of fucking a [italic type]man[roman type] in the ass, the tight hole around his cock, and the knowledge that he's subduing the last, and most troublesome, of his men does seem to keep Allen plenty hard while hammering into Carl.";

Looking down where his red rocket of a dog-cock is thrusting in and out of the other man, Allen withdraws fully, grinning in satisfaction as his erection slides out more and more, then whips up a little when the pointy tip slips past the rim of Carl's hole. Him inspecting his handiwork allows you a glimpse too, and all you can see through the large tear in Carl's pants is fur, no longer the pale skin of the man's buttocks. Grabbing the belt-line of the camo pants, Allen pulls down a bit, then comments, 'Starting a tail too, golden-boy. Bet it'll be a tiny, pathetic one, from the looks of it, haha!

As the first splash of his virile and highly infectious cum starts to rocket into the other soldier, Allen's eyes go wide in a realization, and he tries to pull his hips back a bit. As that doesn't seem to work, he then yanks his hips back violently, drawing a pained scream from Carl as the already mostly inflated knot is forced past his opening.

The man is reduced to whimpers and moans as his bones re-shape themselves with disturbing, crunching sounds. Meanwhile, Allen's transformation is more gradual, controlled by the man keeping himself on a diluted dose of infection blockers. For him, there seems to be something going on inside the camo pants that he's still wearing. You can see his boot slipping from where the man has braced against the floor to allow him to thrust hard into Carl, followed by Allen kicking out, which makes the combat boot dislodge from what no longer is a human foot but rather a paw. At first, it is relatively slender, but then the transformation progresses to make the paw grow, with rough-skinned pads and clawed toes forming, wider-spread than a human's toes.";

This breaks the tension in Allen's body, making him fall back away from Carl as he feels spasms of transformation rock his body. Still, they're far less severe than with the man he just raped, as Allen lies on the ground and catches his bearings before rolling onto his back, then undoing his pants and shoving/kicking them off.

It's the vibrator that Carl got from a sex shop somewhere, intending it to be given to Davies to help with her needs. Now, it is Allen who rips his way into the package and whips out the sizable teal sex toy. Flipping it over to look at the flat end, he pokes at it a little, then grins broadly.

The steps falter a second later, and you hear someone heaving for breath instead.

While you're still idly thinking about that, you hear another pair of footsteps in the distance, soon joined by the shout of, 'You can't run from me, bitch! I'll find you!

Making her look at his still form, squirming a little as she doesn't know what is going on, you proceed to tell her that the German shepherd is a bad dog. He made you fight him, and it was her fault that he was drawn in. Someone needs to be taught a lesson. 'Do - do you mean hitting me too?' she asks, suddenly frightened as she stares at the street dog, but you just shake your head and tell her that wasn't the lesson, just what you needed to pacify the mutt. A cruel grin crosses your face as you add that the lesson is what you'll do next. Giving the speechless husky a stern look, you then step up to push the German shepherd onto his back and proceed to slap his cheeks none to gently to wake him up.";
	say "     With a groan, the street dog looks up at you and blinks, then tries to protect himself by raising his hands. You simply bypass his feeble attempts, instead moving right in and grasping the fur over his throat firmly and giving it a wrench to get his full attention. 'What'dya want, fucker?' he asks with a glare, earning him another slap in the face. Then you explain to him that he'll serve as an example of a bad dog learning to obey. His muzzle starts to scrunch up in defiance, with the dog saying, 'No way, I'm my own -' You punch his nose before he's even done speaking. 'Ouch, hey! I -', he starts, but you raise your fist threateningly again, which finally shuts the guy up properly. Then you put him through his paces, treating the anthro like a dog in training, although you regularly have to underline your commands with new applications of strategic violence. He begs and rolls over, sitting and barking on command - which is made easier by his human intelligence, though harder by the defiance you're having to beat out of him. All throughout this time, the husky bitch watches your training with wide eyes. When you eventually wrap up, you're fairly certain she's well-conditioned to just obey your requests, not wanting to go through the same treatment.";

As you quietly put your stuff on again, you gruffly tell the male canine that he shouldn't dare to leave that position, or to look up, and the cowed dog nods obediently. Then you tap the female anthro's arm and wave her to follow you, strolling down the street and leaving the German shepherd behind. A cruel grin crosses your face as you wonder if someone will find him like that and make use of him before the street dog eventually decides to disobey. Not your problem though, and you can't really take him with you to continue his training as you've already got one dog on your hands.";

Amusement painted on your lips, you clearing your throat and tell the anthro that you'll call her Amy from now on - after an old schoolmate who also was a slutty little bitch. The back-handed slap at the original Amy goes straight over the husky's head, with her simply looking at you and saying, 'Amy? Amy. A M Y. Amy - sounds good. So I'm Amy?'

He even slaps her face, and not particularly gently, but can't rouse her from the stupor.";

Leaning his head down, he throws some bites into the mix, which would surely leave a visible mark if it wasn't for the fur covering her skin. Normal fucking soon becomes just a relentless hammering of his crotch against hers, enough to likely bruise her pussy from the violent thrusts. As you watch, you can only hope that the nanites will fix that quickly, otherwise the poor husky will be more than sore when she wakes up.

Instead, Allen adds a final act of cruelty to this newest rape by just yanking his cock out of her, uncaring to the discomfort that creates to Davies, or even himself. Looking down at the sore, reddened ring of her momentarily gaping vagina, with his white seed starting to trickle out of it, the man's face pulls into an approximation of a smile. Then he grabs a pillow and slides it under her hips, raising them at an angle so the sperm will seep deeper into her instead of dripping out. Possessively planting a hand on her belly, he says to Davies, 'You'll make this disappointing performance up to me, when I fuck your next pup right in front of your eyes!'";

Their city-camouflage clothing strewn about on the floor and rifles leaning against the opposite wall, you see two soldiers in intimate embrace on a bed. It's a man and a woman, with his hips pumping up and down as he fucks her with fast strokes while she holds him close to her body.

Her partner isn't far behind, plunging his shaft deep into her pussy and grunting with each shot of semen he cums into her. They lie on the bed in each other's arms for a moment, then the man pulls his cum-dripping cock out of her and stands up, going for a pack of cigarettes lying on a dresser nearby. The woman just lies there, softly stroking her wet pussy lips as she rides out the last bit of her orgasm. Unseen, but deep inside her, her partner's sperm race onwards, doing their duty in the battle to keep humanity going. The fastest of them soon finds a fertile egg, burrowing into it and starts a new life.

Both you and the feline Bob notice Lee shifting uncomfortably as she describes getting fucked in the ass, then later her pussy after she turned, the front of the soldier's pants tenting out as he looks at his transformed squad mate. Idly, she spritzes herself, and then sends a scented cloud over to Lee.";

She purrs louder as Lee steps up to her, kissing her muzzle. With shaking hands, he undoes his belt and just lets his pants drop to the ground, then brushes his erection against her satin panties. With a deft claw, she pulls the fabric aside and suddenly cries out as he enters her, sinking his manhood into her welcoming depths. Cupping Bobbie's firm ass in both hands, Lee lifts her, setting her on the edge of the counter as he thrusts deep into her. Meow-moaning, she wraps her nylon covered thighs around his body, her gripping claws leaving shallow scratches down his back and digging into his ass.";

It's a group of male snow leopards, grinning at each other as they stalk towards the back of the store. To be on the safe side, you decide to slip inside one of the clothing racks to better hide yourself among the long coats on it. The sound of tearing clothes startles you and wrenches your attention back to the pair of soldiers, but you realize it's just Lee's khaki shirt being shredded by Bobbie's claws, leaving the tattered remains of his shirt at their feet.";

The mating couple screams as they orgasm together, Bobbie's cunt overfilling with Lee's fertile seed. Both pause, their bodies shaking and shuddering. Panting heavily, Lee slips his shrinking shaft from his lover, and rests against the counter beside the mewling Bobbie. His cock, shrinking away, vanishes into his body as a wet gash forms. The formerly crew-cut hair on his head lengthens, sliding down his back to rest above his furry, cute bubble butt.";

	say "     Wandering through the mostly empty streets, skirting around piles of rubble and wrecked cars, you can't help but think how quiet it is - too quiet for comfort really, as this makes you wonder what monster might be hiding behind the next corner. Then, as you come to the next street intersection and peek around the edge of a brick building, you are surprised by the fact that it isn't one of the infected in some sort of strange shape that you see. No, instead there are two humans just a few steps away - dressed in army fatigues and armed with rifles.";
	say "     The men spot you at the same time as you see them, and the front man - twenty-something, brown-haired and with a manly, square-jawed face, a corporal from his rank markings - brings up his weapon in a flash and calls out to you, 'Step out where I can see you. NOW!' Somewhat intimidated by his threatening pose, you comply, giving the man a questioning look as you slowly raise your hands. 'Are there any more around the corner behind you?' he demands to know, relaxing a little bit again as you shake your head in what seems to be a sufficiently honest way.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The rifle aimed at you lowers a little and the soldier nods towards you, giving a somewhat apologetic smile. 'Sorry citizen, I'll have to ask you to step over to the other side of the street now and let us pass. I'm corporal Shaw and this is private Kerry. I know everyone here in the city is suffering from current events, but we're on a very important mission to-' He is interrupted by his team-mate following behind, a quite young-looking guy with reddish hair, 'Err - corporal, I'm really hot.' From the looks of him, the poor guy must literally be just out of boot camp, being unlucky to be dropped right in the middle of this fine mess as his first deployment.";
	say "     'Can it private! You're in the army, so shut up and soldier,' Shaw growls over his shoulder, then turns back to you. But just as he is about to go on, the clatter of a rifle and army helmet bouncing on the pavement makes him and you turn to his unfortunate companion. The red-headed man groans in discomfort, holding his stomach as he wavers on his feet, then suddenly starts to claw his uniform jacket off his body. 'Oh fuck!' the corporal Shaw swears and rushes to the other soldier.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Get a hold of yourself. You gotta take your shot NOW!' the man shouts to his distressed companion, then makes a grab for a bright red tube stuffed into his subordinate's waistband. An eye-blink later, he has the cylinder - that you recognize as some sort of auto-injector - in his hand and yanks the plastic cap at its end off to apply it... but he is too late. The sound of ripping fabric fills the air as the private Kerry has an obviously quite painful growth spurt, going instantly from a pretty slender frame to having a pumped-up physique all over.";
	say "     Arms rippling with muscles thrash about as his nerves burn from all the changes going on - sending corporal Shaw flying, smacking against the nearby wall and landing in a dazed sprawl on the sidewalk. While he groans and tries to get up again, the transforming soldier clutches his red-haired head in pain, then lets out a somewhat animalistic bellow as horns start to sprout from the side of his head. He's starting to look a bit like a bull - or maybe a minotaur? Finally having gotten to his feet, corporal Shaw stares wide-eyed at the rapid transformation going on in front of his eyes.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Getting over his shock in record time, Shaw grabs for another injector that he himself carries - only to find it cracked and broken by his hard landing. The soldier then looks around frantically for the original red tube - and he spots it moments later, rolling down the slightly inclined sidewalk towards you. 'Help me with that, quick!' he shouts to you, holding out his hand.";
	say "     [bold type]So, what do you want to do now?[roman type][line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Snatch up the injector and throw it for the guy to catch.";

	if Player consents: [stop the transformation]
		LineBreak;
		say "     Proving cool under pressure, you grab the little cylinder from the ground and give it a skillful throw - sending it sailing through the air in what seems like slow motion, to be successfully caught by corporal Shaw. He literally rips the protective cap off its end and rams the injector into a still growing pec on his fellow soldier - whose transformation slows down rapidly, then stops fully. As soon as his muscles aren't under high tension anymore, private Kerry collapses with a groan. For a moment, nothing can be heard but the breathless panting of everyone involved as your bodies come down from all the excitement again.";
		say "     Then you step a little closer and glance down upon private Kerry. Where the young man formerly was pretty slim, he's built like a football-player now and has grown at least half a foot, with two about three inch long horns poking out of his red buzz-cut hair on the left and right of his head. He shifts a little uncomfortably on the ground, pushing himself up - then pulls the tail he was lying on out from under himself and looks at it in surprise. It is thin and covered in short fur, with a bigger red tuft of fur at the end.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Well, fuck!' corporal Shaw says from where he is leaning against the wall next to you, rubbing a hurting arm. 'Guess the booster shots don't last as long as usual when you're strongly exposed. Wouldn't that have been good to know before this fuck-up of an operation.' Yet another ripping sound draws your attention back to the muscular soldier on the ground - turns out he flexed his leg muscles to stand up and burst the increasingly ragged pants he's wearing, tearing them at the seams.";
		say "     As Kerry stands up, he wavers a little on his thicker than before legs, which causes something to slip out of the large rip in his pants at the back, dividing the camo pattern fabric into what's basically just two flaps over his buttocks. The object falling to the ground interestingly bounces a little, once, twice, then rolls to a stop in the drain at the edge of the road - it's an electric blue butt-plug, wet with a creamy white sheen.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The young soldier out of whose ass it slipped starts to lean down to take it again, exposing his clearly well-fucked and cum-dripping asshole to both corporal Shaw and yourself. This prompts the other man to clear his throat and say, 'Leave it, kid. I - I don't think the sample you had is still valid now anyways.' Looking back at him and realizing his state of mostly un-dress, Kerry blushes and replies with a, 'Yes sir!' Then he scrambles to improvise at least a loincloth from his jacket, replacing the split pants.";
		say "     The two soldiers gather their stuff, faces red with embarrassment, then talk with one another in quiet murmurs for a moment. Finally, private Kerry approaches you a bit shyly. 'Um, I gotta thank you for what you did. Helping me stop - you know... transforming. So. Here, take this - I can't wear it anyways now.' With that, he hands you his army helmet, as well as two MREs. The soldiers then march off, clearly not wanting to talk about what happened here.";

		LineBreak;
		say "     Kicking the injector away from the desperate man, you see his eyebrows draw together in outrage. Corporal Shaw even makes a few steps towards you - in the course of which he misses the ever quicker transformation of his fellow soldier. Fabric tears and falls to the ground as he grows and grows, his face drawing out into a muzzle as the horns curve to the front, giving him an anthro bull's head. By now towering over the other man, the newly transformed minotaur makes a step forward on his furred legs ending in hooves, lowering his head to sniff at his superior.";
		say "     The warm wash of air from minotaur Kerry's breath is the first sign for corporal Shaw that he's in big trouble, causing him to whirl around and gape at the hulking beast that was his squad-mate just minutes before. Gaze inevitably drawn to the thick and meaty shaft dangling between the bull-man's legs, Shaw gulps, then calls out, 'Private! Stand down! Fuck, Kerry! Don't do this kid! I'll use this if I must!' His hands snatch up the rifle hanging by a strap around his torso, threatening the minotaur with it.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     It takes a few seconds before you and Shaw realize that the magazine of the gun actually got bent and cracked during the impact with the wall earlier, causing all the bullets to tumble out - leaving the human soldier with no ammunition at all. 'Fuck!' he snarls, but before he can add anything more, the mythical beast standing in front of him speaks in a deep voice. 'You smell nice,' minotaur Kerry says, his cock twitching a little as he reaches out for the man in front of him.";

		if Player consents: [yup]
			LineBreak;
			say "     Even though the man struggles, he is no match for the much larger and stronger bull-man, allowing Kerry to easily rip the uniform off his captive. Before long, Shaw is fully naked in his grasp, except... is that a black butt-plug buried between the soldier's buttocks?! The minotaur reaches down between Shaw's legs and pulls the sex toy free with his thick fingers, causing a gush of cum to squirt out of the man's hole with it. He must have been stuffed with cum! Kerry the minotaur sniffs the plug eagerly and licks the cum sticking to it off, then drops the item and starts to stroke his mighty shaft.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Let go of me! NOW - I won't let you... aarrghhhHH!' the frantic shouts of the man end in a scream as the minotaur impales him on his thick rod, thankfully helped along by the cream filling the man already has. Kerry gives a very satisfied roar as he sinks himself into his former superior, his thick throbbing meat sliding deep into the man. Then he starts to fuck, pumping corporal Shaw up and down on his erection while holding the man with his two large hands. Thankfully the groans and pained wincing of the soldier quickly gets replaced by more and more aroused moans, as the guy can't help but get into being fucked by this powerful beast.";
			say "     Before much longer, the human is holding on to his captor's arms and actively slides his own ass up and down on his long pole, all the while his own cock is rock hard. The coupling of man and towering beast turns into more of a mutual affair, filling the street with satisfied groans, grunts and moans. It doesn't take that much longer before corporal Shaw can't hold back anymore and starts blasting out long spurts of cum, splattering his powerful minotaur partner's abs and pecs. The twitching and flexing of the man's rectum around his cock drives Kerry over the edge in short notice too, and with a loud bellow, the minotaur's balls start pumping a massive load into the human's innermost depths.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     As the hard washboard abs of the trained soldier start to vanish from sight when his belly swells with every further spurt of minotaur cum, corporal Shaw's body doesn't stay unchanged either - the man starts sprouting small horns just a short moment afterwards. Seems like he's got a noticeable resistance to the transformation, but with enough fucking by his huge partner, that will no doubt wear away. After finishing himself in the man and taking a short break, Kerry the minotaur wanders off, still with the other soldier impaled on his prick.";
			say "     You have little doubt that he'll keep fucking him, all the way until they are both minotaurs and beyond. Left behind after the conclusion of their coupling, you check over the scene of broken gear and ripped clothing. Salvaging what you can, you carry off two MREs and an army helmet that might just be useful for protecting you.";

Therefore you're not really surprised when grunts, growls and shouts echo out of a nearby alley, drawing your attention. Being the curious person that you are, you do a little sprint over to the opening of said alley and peek inside. The fight going on in the alley is between two anthro hyenas in leather jackets and a male soldier. As you stick your head around the corner, the muscular black guy just punches the first of his attackers right in the muzzle, sending her sprawling on the floor. This enrages the second hyena quite a bit, who throws himself on the soldier, earning him a painful punch to the side but also forcing the human into close-up wrestling to keep the hyena's gnashing teeth from his throat.";
	say "     You find yourself drawn into watching the muscular soldier struggle with his opponent - lots of punching, squeezing, scratching, biting, and even some groping from the hyena. This guy is clearly no novice to fighting and uses ALL weapons available to him - including the fact that the nanites override people's will to resist if they get horny enough. The conclusion of their fight is uncertain for a while - but eventually the soldier starts to get the upper hand as he manages to catch the canine's closed maw in grip. With the threat of being bitten momentarily removed, the human uses his handhold to twist back his enemy's head, then slams a shoulder into the anthro's chest to bull-rush him into the nearest wall. With a hollow thunk, the hyena's head impacts the bricks, after which his human opponent lets go, allowing the canine to crumple bonelessly to the floor. He is still alive, from what you can see - with the nanites, most wounds heal sooner or later after all - but surely out for the count.";

Panting for breath, the soldier looks at the pile of hyenas and walks a few steps away, rapidly regaining his composure. 'You really saved my bacon,' he calls over to you and gives a thankful smile.

Camo pattern pants, army boots and an olive colored backpack are the only other pieces of equipment on him, with all of them somewhat ripped and torn.

Just ATE it, lock, stock, and barrel! But yeah - it wasn't that useful in that situation anyway - you can't just shoot everyone just because they're being driven crazy by this nanite shit!'

With that, the man turns his back to you, holding up his shirt a little. You tell him what you see - a muscular back with smooth, sweaty black skin... and a few hairs of what looks like hyena fur sticking up above the waistband of his pants. He stiffens, straightening his back, then Monty's hands move to the front of his pants, undoing the button and zipper. He then pushes the camo pants down a little bit, slowly.";

Several excavators are actively moving around, pushing rubble to fill the caved-in roads. Seems like someone remembered that the sewers were also a possible access path and destroyed them through the use of more explosives. The question of who is doing all this is easy enough to answer, as there are numerous soldiers visible on the other side of this line cutting through the outer city.

An enormous contingent of troops stand guard upon the affected zone, ready to hold back any and all tries to break the quarantine - meaning that you won't be getting to safety this way.
