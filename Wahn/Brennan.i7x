		say "     The streets seem fairly empty right now - a good time to be out and about, scavenging or hunting for whatever. Skirting around a burned-out car here and there, piles of trash or even rubble from buildings destroyed in fights (or overenthusiastic lovemaking), you make good progress on your way. Soon, you arrive at a fairly big intersection of roads, dominated by a multi-car pileup. Glancing at the four directions meeting here, broad and open spaces with no real cover or concealment, you're not surprised to find numerous piles of torn and cum-stained clothing scattered about. This must be a prime hunting spot for ferals, running down people or swooping in from above to catch those exposed in the open, which means that the numerous personal vehicle wrecks - and a mangled grayhound bus on the opposite side of where you stand - have in all likelihood not been looted yet!";

Ignoring reddish-brown stains on the inside of the cars as best as you can (while being thankful that you haven't found any actual bodies yet), you glance through cracked windows, stick your head into one car or two that seem most promising and... Strike! There's a grocery shopping bag on the passenger seat of a minivan. Pulling open its door with an alarmingly loud creak, you snatch up the bag. For a second, you're disappointed as you see a wilted and somewhat smelly packet of salad and several apples (shrunken and brown) on the top, but after dumping the rotten food, you grin broadly as two energy bars and several small bottles of name-brand sparkling water come to light below it!";

Walking around a tangled mess of metal in which you can't even see where one car begins and the other ends, you approach the bus - and are shocked to see someone come out of it! Seems like you're not the only one who wanted to check out this scavenging spot. From what you can see, the guy stepping off the stairs of the bus is surprisingly fully human. He is fairly tall and broad-shouldered, dressed in sturdy boots, cargo pants with many pockets, and a sleeveless shirt that clings tightly to a muscular upper body, a bulging backpack slung over one shoulder. He notices you in turn and a wary expression spreads over his fairly attractive bearded face.";

The wariness lifts from his gaze and he gives you a friendly smile, though still doesn't relinquish his secure grasp on that baseball bat. Man, he must have been through some things to be that cautious - not unfounded of course, from your own experiences. 'Stay back a bit please,' Brennan goes on to say as you come closer, and gives you an apologetic shrug. 'Sorry, but I've seen how quickly this - whatever it is - spreads. I've worked too long to... be the man I am to let anything take that from me.'";

The two of you chat a little about the things you have seen, what to look out for and so on. One thing sticks out to you as particularly interesting - Brennan warns you about picking up any gun you might find. 'I think it's the metal, you know. Possibly in combination with all those trace materials from firing, and maybe even skin cells of the owner on the grip. From what I've seen, firearms serve as seedbeds for the infection. There was this one guy - a cop - who pulled a pistol, only to have it crumble to silvery dust - which enveloped him and almost instantly transformed him.' Now that you think of it... there is a definite lack of all the weapons you'd expect from an American city here.";

That's a safer bet,' Brennan tells you, then slowly pulls out a taser from a large pocket in his cargo pants, careful to not threaten you with it. Showing off the device, with its black plastic grip and bright yellow top, he gives you a companionable nod. 'Okay then, I think we should go - this lull in activity can't last forever. Wouldn't want to be picked off out here by a passing wyvern. Best of luck out there, and I hope we'll see each other again. Can't believe how good it felt to just talk to someone.' With a wave, the bearded man starts walking towards the nearest street corner, then dashes to it and vanishes in an alley.

Firing with a small bang far too quiet to be a firearm, the taser shoots two pointed electrodes to lodge in your chest, pumping large amounts of electricity into your body and making you collapse in a thrashing heap.";

Eventually, the two reach the edge of the pileup, and he calls out, 'Good luck out there!' With that, the guy whirls around and sprints into a nearby alley, vanishing from sight. Shrugging to yourself, you feel the comfortable weight of your own pack, filled with what loot you got out of the situation. It's best this way, most likely.

Looks like a human, not that you can make out too much detail from this distance and with the speed he is moving. There is a well-bulging backpack on his back - seems like you missed your opportunity to scavenge and let him run off with the spoils. You can't help but wonder who he may be, but somehow doubt you'll ever see him again - not in the chaos that the city has become.

Hmpf, nothing left for you here - these places must have been targeted within a few days of society breaking down when shit really hit the fan at the start of the nanite spread. With a resigned shrug, you glance over to the other side of the street, past a car that has been crushed into the asphalt (wyvern landing on it maybe?). There is a corner gas station, clearly looted and with a grinning hyena head spray-painted on one cracked window, then an empty lot filled with yellow grass, and a bicycle store.

A latex fox lair, you're fairly sure from the sight of that. As if to specifically confirm your hunch, one of the vulpine creatures dashes into sight, its flexible paws scrambling on the smooth floor as it takes the corner from an adjoining room at full speed and bounces off a bike frame still hanging on the wall. Before the bike even has a chance to fall and crash to the ground, the screeching latex fox is already running again - head on towards you.

Cautiously walking into the workshop, stepping over one of the foxes, you soon lay eyes upon the person who gave them such a thrashing. It is a man you know: Brennan. The broad-shouldered guy is standing at a workbench in the back of the room, his baseball bat laid on it while he is filling his backpack. A number of energy drink bottles still wait to be packed away, as well as a slender metal container or two that you can't quite place at the moment.

The stuff makes creatures like our little friends around here go wild... I got some ideas about using that. As for the rest - a happy coincidence. They had a partial crate of these energy drinks under the workbench.' Stuffing the rest of the lube in his backpack, followed by most of the energy drink bottles, the tough survivor goes on to say, 'I'd love to chat with you, but... I think they're starting to come to. So here, have one on me and see ya again another time.'

Intent on reaching your destination without being sidetracked, you keep to the back roads, avoiding any possible distractions or hostile encounters. Eventually, your path leads through the outer fringes of the populated area of the city, through some lightly wooded unclaimed land and then up to the highway. 'There,' your companion says and points at something a little distance ahead, and you can see what remains of the army convoy. The lead Humvee is literally peeled open, with its roof missing and the hood dented in by a giant claw that grabbed hold of it. Looks like the wyvern didn't want to wait for everyone to get out and simply pulled apart their car to get to the soldiers. Meanwhile, the truck at the back end has been knocked over and lies on its side, which just leaves the middle one - standing upright but boxed in at the front and back by the other vehicles.";

There is a cluster of four just beside the Humvee, five more behind the knocked-over truck, and three singletons on the other side of the highway, the last of which is right at the edge of the woods. 'Can't you just imagine them driving into the city?' Brennan says to you in almost a whisper. 'Everything is fine in one second, then the wyvern lands on the lead vehicle and starts tearing it apart. Before people even know what is going on, it is spreading its slobber over the first captives, giant claws molding the guys into those eggs. Then people out of the back truck start shooting at it, it reacts and pounces on them...'";

Looking fairly grim at the scene before you, Brennan shakes himself and then adds, 'But we should keep going.

Looks like part of the load shifted and fell over on the crashing halt by the wyvern roadblock, and a few of the crates seem to have been ransacked, too. Looks like you are not the first to visit this place after all.

Sadly, they're mostly wedged together or blocked by other fallen crates, and you can only realistically carry so much. When you come to stand on the highway again, you see Brennan bent over a mid-sized plastic crate, intently reading a red instruction leaflet. 'I think I know why our friends here haven't hatched yet. Look at this!' he says, picking up a bright red plastic tube he laid out on the crate lid and holding it so you can read the words 'Immunity Booster' printed on its side. A slender syringe rattles around inside it. 'Seems like this is protection against the transformations! For a time, at least. The info said something about daily injections...'";

Obviously male and half-erect from the thrill of pouncing on you, the hawkmen turn their avian heads to the side appraisingly. A lecherous grin forms on the corners of their beaks, and one of them says, 'Nice of you to collect those goodies for us. We love when fuck-toys bring presents!'

The beast stands still as he studies you intently, seemingly unsure of what to do.

The large gray and brown beasts look up at him intently as he points at the trunk of the car. 'Here, have a sniff and tell me if there's any food in there. Same thing with the other cars around. Come on guys, I know you can understand a fair bit of what I'm saying. Work with me here.'

When I confronted who was tracking me, it turned out to be the two ferals from the... incident in that alley. Color me surprised when they didn't try to attack at that point, but instead ducked their heads before me, whining. And then they rolled over on their backs and totally submitted.

Stroking his wolf's head and saying, 'Good boy Remus, that was very good,' he then starts to stuff those supplies that haven't gone bad into his backpack. 'It's been strange, being with these two.

Congratulating Brennan on how things worked out, you give the wolves a stroke yourself after he tells them that they should treat you like family.

Eventually, you're all caught up on all the current news and the two of you decide to go your separate ways.

[connecting to the Green Apartment / Green Lobby in Core Mechanics/Basic Locations]

Survivor Refuge is a room. Survivor Refuge is above Green Lobby.
The description of Survivor Refuge is "[SurvivorRefugeDesc]".

to say SurvivorRefugeDesc:
	say "     The apartment that Brennan has claimed as his base of operations has a fairly nice loft setup, with one big room containing the living space, kitchen and dining area. Only the bedroom and bathroom are separated off, with the former lying towards the west, the latter to the south. The apartment has floors made out of walnut wood, shining in a rich reddish-brown, as well as simple but elegant furniture in similar earthen tones. Looks like the original owner had a fair bit of money and good taste, and so had Brennan, when he decided to move into this apartment. This place felt a welcoming and friendly, just like him. He seems to have kept the living space tidy, even now, during the height of the nanite apocalypse. This included bringing in a row of sorting boxes, now well-filled with useful salvage. Additionally, a weightlifting bench has been set up, including numerous weights which were clearly not part of the original setup.";

Brennan's Microwave is an object. It is in Survivor Refuge. It is fixed in place. Understand "microwave" as Brennan's Microwave.
The description of Brennan's Microwave is "A mid-sized white microwave stands on one of the work surfaces of the kitchen, clashing a bit with the decor. But who cares about that as long as you can [bold type]microwave[roman type] stuff with it?".

Brennan's Bedroom is a room. Brennan's Bedroom is west of Survivor Refuge.
The description of Brennan's Bedroom is "[BrennansRoomDesc]".

to say BrennansRoomDesc:
	say "     Brennan's bedroom is fairly large and kept in the same style as the main part as the loft - walnut floor and elegant furniture also made from wood in rich tones of red and brown. One of those is an expansive double bed, fairly low to the ground and with a really thick mattress. This gives a lot of room for people to do all sorts of things on it. The bed is standing on a large, white and very fluffy carpet. You see in this room more signs cluing you on Brennan's practical nature: a spare baseball bat leaning against the wall just beside the bed, a telescope for scouting and observation set up near the window, as well as a writing desk in one corner, which has a cleanly organized collection of medkits, immunity boosters and all sorts of other emergency items.";

Brennan's Bathroom is a room. Brennan's Bathroom is south of Survivor Refuge.
The description of Brennan's Bathroom is "[BrennansBathroomDesc]".

to say BrennansBathroomDesc:
	say "     The bathroom of the apartment is a fairly nice affair, decked out in gray marble and everything. Too bad the water isn't actually running. You see a number of large water canisters stacked up in one corner, with elbow-long protective gloves on lying on top and the words 'DIRTY WATER' scrawled on each one. Seems like Brennan has to fill the reservoir of the toilet by hand. A plastic bucket is standing in a large walk-in shower cabin, with a soft-looking natural sponge right next to it. Not the luxury of what the room could provide if the water was actually running, but at least it's a way to keep clean...";

Then the elevator sets into motion, soon delivering you on the 5th floor. A few steps later, you arrive at apartment 5A and let yourself in.";

There might still be a chance to end up like some creature, with a beastly mind to match a monstrous form. No way I'm gonna try that!' Quickly raising your hands to stop him and interject an argument, you explain that there is no transformation involved in what you have in mind. This mollifies the human survivor a little, but he gapes at you openly as you mention your supernatural alternative. 'What? Magic? That's ridic- oh, wait.

You've really been someone I can rely upon. But enough of such sappy talk - let's get going!' Together, you set out towards the coast with Brennan moving at a quick and determined pace. The location described in the flier is several miles down the coast from the public beach, where only some dunes divide more low-lying roads from the beach and sea. Sadly, the beach itself isn't particularly broad or nice to be on in the area, a product of strong currents washing away sand and also making swimming fairly dangerous. Your target beach house is the last one on the road, just before the dunes.";

It doesn't take long before a first robed figure walks past, head hidden under a deep hood. He or she meets two others on the street and they all file into the side door of the target house. Seems like they are really letting that secrecy slide these days - but hey, the whole crazy situation in this city makes this group of folks not seem too outlandish, even while out on a stroll in blue-black robes. It doesn't take long before another two cultists meet up, this time right on the other side of the very bushes Brennan and you are hiding in. You can overhear them easily and look out at them from behind the leaves. Cultist number one is clearly a man, while you are not quite as sure about number two, standing with his or her back to you and a fairly unisex tone of voice.";

Just busy with work all the time. But hey, that's no longer an issue these days anymore, is it!' Laughter follows, and cultist number two adds, 'Man, I've missed this. The last time for me was... early spring. Remember that one? Such a sweet sacrifice - young woman, just moved to the city.' You can't help but shudder at the casual tone in which they discuss the death and chaos brought on by the nanite infection, causing civil society to collapse, as well as whatever they did to that poor victim. Then the first cultist speaks up again, 'We've been getting visits from one of His envoys. The visitor has already 'blessed' many of us to prepare for the glorious descent into the deep!'";
	say "     He raises his hand as he says this, stretching out his fingers to show some webbing between them and the fact that his skin looks a bit scaly. 'But wait till you see the rest of his gifts!' And with that, the man opens the front of his robe, presenting his body to his fellow cultist - completely naked beneath the blue-black fabric. You can see that the scaly skin covers the entirety his body, and the quickly hardening shaft between his legs is not human anymore, either. Instead it shows some 'interesting' little ridges around a fairly flat head that is at an angle to its length. 'Damn, that's tempting,' the second cultist replies, reaching out to run a still-human hand down the naked man's front and touching his transformed manhood. The horny cultist leans into the touch, then adds, 'You know - I wouldn't mind sharing some of my blessed state with you. We still got time before the arrival most likely... higher beings don't exactly follow appointments to the minute.'";

As moans and grunts start up a moment later, Brennan gives you a telling look, then sneaks after them. Just a minute or so later, he returns with two stolen robes and hands one to you. 'Let's hope they'll take a while. That weird-dicked guy was moaning that he could keep up all day, so I think we're good for this disguise.' Nodding to him, you look at the robe and slip into it. It actually is fairly comfortable, even if it smells of salt and seawater. Kinda makes sense to use nice fabric, if some of them go naked under the robes. After you pull up the hood to hide your face, same as Brennan, the two of you hurry over to the gathering place.";

They're using the chance to do some small talk. Thankfully, the hidden nature of the cult meant that they did their meetings infrequently and very low key, so you get away with pretending to be members who just haven't been able to come in a while. The group is joined by a few more latecomers before one cultist wearing an eye-twisting silver amulet steps forward and says, 'Let us begin.' All of you file through a double door into a room at the back of the house, looking out onto the dunes. It is decorated in banners of black and blue velvet, and a structure that can only be called an altar is standing in the middle of the room - on it, a small-ish idol shaped from green rock.";

The high priest opens the glass sliding doors wide and looks out at the dunes, then nods under his hood. 'Let us begin and call the envoy,' he intones, stepping up to the altar and standing before it. Then he speaks unnatural, half-clicked words: 'Ia! Ia! Kcha Grath'On fhtagn egn'det!'

Or maybe not cold - given that it (he) has a half-hard erection sticking out from a genital slit between those legs. 'We welcome you, Deep One!' the high priest calls out in awe, then steps back from the altar to make room for the nonhuman visitor. The creature lays a hand upon the altar in front of the icon and intones, 'Kcha Grath'On fhtagn egn'det! I'ka votagt D'ner!'

Naked, the human survivor is almost a paragon of masculinity - from the handsome, bearded face, broad shoulders, firm pecs and abs, even down to his muscular legs. The only thing that is conspicuously absent is a cock between his legs, its location instead taken up by a vagina, complete with a little bush of pubic hair. Stepping a little closer, Nermine holds out the box and says, 'The use of this precious item is twofold. On one hand, it is a truly excellent jackal cock that can please the user to no end if used as a toy. And for those who are curious and adventurous, it can serve exactly as the real organ would.'";

'Just a little push,' the jackaless continues as she gently presses against Brennan's hand to make the curved end of the magic plug-in slip into his vagina. 'Damn, that's pretty nice! So warm and filling,' he says with a pleased groan. Nermine simply grins before she adds, 'It gets even better. The dear customer need only know its command word and say it in his mind.' And then, she bends her muzzle to his ear and whispers something to Brennan. 'O-okay. I'm gonna try!' he replies in an excited tone, closing his eyes and putting on an expression of intense concentration.

Brennan blinks his eyes open and stares in wonder at what is between his legs now, then reaches under his new balls suddenly and feels around. 'The testing customer is completely male now, with no feminine parts until he thinks the command clearly once more. Nermine would suggest he should try so now, as to ascertain the full use of his acquisition.

This time, you see the full process clearly - the cock in Brennan's hand changes color in an instant, shining in a smooth golden glow before that fades to leave the original golden shaft in his grasp. With a little sigh, he pulls the 'plug' section out of his pussy and raises the golden cock from his crotch. Nermine is ready for that and gently plucks it out of his hand, drying the artifact off with a little hand-towel, then placing it back into the box.

Moaning loudly and openly, Brennan leaks copious amounts of femcum all over your thrusting hand - and you do your best to extend his orgasm as long as possible, stroking his insides and tenderly nibbling on his clit.

Wrapping a hand around the golden shaft, Brennan gently tugs at it, moaning quietly as the curved base piece of the magic item slides from his pussy, drawing little strings of wetness with it that indicate his intense arousal in this female state too.

Accepting his challenge, you crouch down to impatiently pop open the button of his pants and lower its zipper before wrenching the piece of clothing down, sliding it over his muscular thighs. The baggy boxer shorts beneath are already somewhat tented, and with an eager Brennan looking down upon you, the bulge grows larger by the second. While you're still tugging his pants off, the human male pulls the tight shirt over his head and throws it aside, giving you a glorious show of rippling abs and stretching muscles.

The reddish canine shaft between your friend's legs goes visibly stiff, then changes color to take on a golden shine, glowing from within. From one eye-blink to the next, the crotch that once boasted his canine shaft and a full pair of balls has become more feminine in shape, with a pubic mound and a well-sized clit above the folds of his vagina. Wrapping a hand around the golden shaft, Brennan gently tugs at it, moaning quietly as the curved base piece of the magic item slides from his pussy, drawing little strings of wetness with it that indicate his intense arousal in this female state too. Carefully setting his precious treasure down upon the small pile of his pants and underwear, Brennan comes to stand before you with his legs in a wide stance, hands on his hips as he looks down expectantly.";

Brennan lets out a pleased sigh at the touch against his female parts, leaning against your hand a little. Moving your fingers, you spread his nether lips and reveal the pink opening of his pussy, wet and slick in his current arousal. Eager to go down on your sexy friend, you dive right in, putting your mouth against his sex and wiggling your tongue into his pussy. 'Nggh! Yeah, that's nice!'

Chuckling, you crouch down and impatiently pop open the button of his pants and lower its zipper before wrenching the piece of clothing down, sliding it over his muscular thighs. The baggy boxer shorts beneath hang loosely over his crotch - not surprising, as the man doesn't have a cock after all.

Making out and with his arms wrapped around you, the two of you stumble through the apartment to soon reach his bed. The trans-man gives you another quick peck on the lips, then lies down and spreads his legs invitingly, his pussy's glistening wetness in open view for you.

The way his sweet pussy feels around your cock, clenching tight at just the right moments, it seems like there is no part of his body Brennan didn't train to perfection. Yet you have more in mind than just giving him a great fuck, so you soon force yourself to pause and reach out to pull his spread legs to wrap around you, followed by his arms. Then you roll the two of you over on the large bed, placing the muscular man on top.";

Brennan lets out in surprise that is soon replaced by eagerness as he thinks about your idea, and the man raises his hand to his lips to give a loud whistle that immediately draws the sound of canine claws scraping over the floorboards after it. In a mad rush, Romulus and Remus join the two of you and jump on the bed, circling around their master and yourself to sniff and lick both of you excitedly. Brennan explains to the two of them what you want to do, making the wolves let out happy barks.";
	say "     There is a little scramble for who will get his muzzle between the man's buttocks the fastest, with Remus being the winner. As he begins to lap the trans-man's pucker with a wet doggy tongue, the second wolf circles around to stand over your head. You get an up-close eyeful of his canine shaft pushing out from its sheath and put your hand on it to jerk the canine to full hardness, then bend his cock to the side and present it to Brennan. The trans-man happily bends forward and wraps his lips around his companion's cock, sucking it into his mouth. With his master now stretched forward and basically presenting to Remus, the wolf quickly finishes up licking Brennan's hole and instead jumps on his back, his hips pumping franticly against your friend's rear. A grunt by Brennan reveals the moment in which he is penetrated by the canine's shaft, followed by the sensation of another hard cock pushing against yours through the muscled man's insides.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You grind up against Brennan's sex and move your manhood inside him, both of you experiencing all sorts of new sensations now that he is being double teamed in both his ass as well as the pussy. This is especially true as Remus pounds into his alpha like the wild beast he is, hammering his asshole with the full length of his canine shaft, including the pre-knot bulge at the bottom that pops in and out of Brennan only with a bit of stretching every time. If he could, you don't doubt your friend would be moaning nonstop from this treatment, but of course Brennan's mouth is full of yet another canine shaft, sucking on it in the determination not to leave any member of his little pack out of the fun. The most you hear from the trans-man are muted grunts and slurps around the doggy cock in his mouth, but even so it is more than obvious that he's having the time of his life at the center of your little foursome.";
	say "     Between Remus and yourself, things just fall into a rhythm where one thrusts in as the other pulls out, meaning that there is not a single moment in which Brennan isn't being shafted hard and deep. The relentless pounding of his holes pushes the transgendered man to higher and higher stages of arousal and you can hear him panting hard through his nose while still suckling on Romulus's shaft. Feeling his pussy tremble and squeeze around your cock in very enoyable ways, you can't help but want to thrust into him even harder, so you buck up into Brennan with everything you got, which pushes the horny guy over the edge in a big way. He gasps loudly in his lust, allowing Romulus's cock to slip out of his mouth and smack the wolf's belly just over your head. As you see the red rocket swing back and forth, dripping pre-cum and spit, your own cock is tightly clenched by Brennan's pussy as it twitches and flexes during his climax.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Remus seems to be experiencing much the same in the other hole, and he lets out a victorious howl at full volume as his knot swells and ties his manhood inside Brennan's ass. Fur-covered canine balls throb hard as they erupt into the wolf's master, breeding the human survivor with a copious load of virile cum. You too can feel the rounded bulge of Remus knot, pushing against your cock inside of Brennan, and just like you two fucked Brennan together, you cum inside him almost at the same time too. With a deep moan, you push your hips up against Brennan and erupt into the depths of his pussy, spurting hot seed into your friend. The three of you slow down as you ride out your orgasms, only lightly grinding against one another in the blissful haze that fills your minds.";
	say "     Some little while later, you're pulled out of your content state by a needy whine from Romulus, the only member of your little party that still hasn't gotten off yet. Brennan quickly picks up on that too, and he says, 'Oh, sorry Romulus. Didn't mean to exclude you.' With that said, he reaches out to grab hold of the wolf's erection and jerks him with his hand, making the wolf pant in pleasure. Getting private attenion from his master is more than thrilling for the feral canine, and it doesn't take long before the wolf shows clear signs of getting close to orgasming. Brennan quickly reacts and stretches his neck aims his canine companion's erection at his open mouth, catching the soon to come spurts of his creamy cum on his tongue. This continues until Romulus spasms slowly ebb off, at which point the wolf turns around to bring his muzzle to Brennan's face. The two of them share a sloppy kiss, during which the trans-man shares his mouthful of cum with the ecstatic wolf.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Okay, that's enough,' Brennan tells his companion with a chuckle a little while later, then commands him to lay down, which the canine readily does. The second wolf on his back is another matter, knotted to his ass as Remus is, so the human survivor has little chance but to gently pull off your own manhood and then lie down on his side with the wolf still stuck inside of him. Not that he minds of course, happily stroking the side of the feral beast as he does so.' Lying on his side in the animal's embrace, your friend smiles at you and pants, 'Wow, that was great! I - I'm a lucky guy to have my three favorite people here with me, all together and enjoying each other. Thank you, for everything.' He reaches out to squeeze your shoulder happily, then lowers his head to rest on the mattress, the exhaustion of all the sex catching up with him and making him doze off.";

Rubbing his bearded chin, the human survivor frowns a little as he goes on to say, 'You know, it wasn't the usual 'Please step back sir! We got orders to maintain a quarantine.' No, these guys immediately went beet-red in the face and murmured something about a 'special mission', then hurried along as if trying to shake me off. I kept up with them for a little while and asked more questions, but all I could get out of them was that they came from 'Camp Bravo'. Have you ever heard of that place?

Letting go of the scruff of his neck, you watch the beast happily turn around on the bed and make room for you to lie next to Brennan, then come to stand over you just like Romulus did with his master. As the feral gives you a wet doggy kiss, you reach between the two of you and take hold of his shaft, aiming it for your waiting sex.";
	say "     With a lusty growl, the wolf thrusts his hips down against you, burying his bone into your pussy and spreading your folds around his already slightly bulging knot. The feral canine you've chosen to mate with is rock hard and horny, wound up more than a little bit from being on the sidelines of Romulus mating with Brennan. As such, he mounts you like a wild beast, hammering into your sex and popping the bulge of his knot past your opening again and again, making you tremble in pleasure from the sensations. While humping against you, the wolf's muzzle moves against your neck and cheek, him giving mostly aimless licks of your sweaty skin - until you grab his head with both hands and pull him into a kiss, suckling on his tongue as it flops around in your mouth.";

That is just amazing.' His comment is almost like a prophecy, as seconds later, Remus hammers into you one last time with all of his power, then howls out in lust and knots your pussy. You feel quite stuffed, yet at the same time really, really good, as the base of his dick balloons even further, far too wide to ever pass your nether lips in this state. Then the first pulse of wolf cum plashes into your depths, accompanied by a tremble of the powerful animal on top of you and a hard throb of his dick. Second by second, he floods you with more of his fertile seed, giving you the amazing feeling of being bred. It only takes a few more pulses of cum into your depths before the sensations finally push you over the edge, moaning helplessly as you weakly hold on to his heaving sides[if player is male]. Your own shaft throbs in rhythm with the wolf flooding your insides, sending pluses of cum to soak the fur of your canine mate's chest[end if].[fimpregchance]";
	say "     By the time you feel your orgasm ebb off and rational consciousness return, Remus has calmed down too and now is just contently lying on top of you, still tied balls-deep to your pussy. Absent-mindedly stroking his fur, you pant for breath and look to the side, where Brennan is looking at you from exactly the same position. 'Quite something, aren't they?' the bearded man says as he gives you a smile and pats your arm, welcoming you the 'pack', before going back to make out with Romulus, sharing sloppy kisses with the wolf. Meanwhile, Remus lowers his head to rest against the crook of your neck, nuzzling against your side and dozing off contently. Looks like your own wolfy partner is more of a cuddle-bug than Romulus, but you don't really mind, as you're content with the feeling of his hard cock still gently pulsing inside you. The four of you stay like that for a while, a pile of post-coital contentment on the bed, until it eventually is time to get back up and worry about survival in the city.";
