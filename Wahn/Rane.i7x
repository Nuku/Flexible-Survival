And not a small one either - it certainly sounds like a rough battle involving several people. Immediately coming to a halt, you begin listening intently, trying to determine where the noises are originating from. The sudden arrival of a leopardman impacting the ground with crunch of breaking bones the just steps ahead of you solves that question quickly, as he must have fallen - or been thrown off - the three story roof of the building. He's in a grisly state but alive, groaning in pain as the nanites inside him start rearranging his body back into its intended shape.";
		say "     Apprehensive of getting crushed under the next thing that might be falling down from above, you quickly duck into the nearest door and slam it shut behind you. Thankfully, even though the building looks inhabited there is no one in right now, though the sounds of fighting coming from above tell you that there's clearly more going on up there... albeit the frequency of sounds is becoming less and less. Against all good judgment, you feel the curious urge to find the source of this situation and begin to, as silently as possible, search for a way up. Finding a stairwell you slowly make your way up floor by floor, listening intently for where the sounds are coming from. Time seems to come to a standstill as you reach the top of the stairwell and are facing the rooftop door access. Seeing that the door is slightly ajar, hold your breath and take a quick peek.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A number of furred bodies are strewn about the rooftop, some splayed around each other and others lying on top of one another. From your hiding spot it is difficult to ascertain further detail than that, and you would have to step out into the open to figure out more. Though it's debatable if that would be such a good idea - considering the violent display before you and the sneaking feeling of being watched that you can't quite shake off. [bold type]Will you examine the scene anyways ([link]Y[as]y[end link]), or would you rather high-tail it out of there ([link]N[as]n[end link])?[roman type][line break]";

A more thorough examination of the bodies shows many different kinds of species in various states of trauma, though most do still seem to still be alive. Several of the bodies seem to be wearing some kind of unique clothing or uniforms as well, one or two of them look to be dressed in soldier fatigues as well, and there are a number of weapons strewn about or still in the hands of the victims.";
			say "     The unsettling feeling of being watched intensifies inside you, making your eyes dart around looking for any signs of movement. In an instant, a lumbering movement catches the corner of your eye and whirling around, you see one of the people that you thought were unconscious is very much awake! The leopardman regards you with a look of pure hatred, his somewhat cross-eyed gaze and jerky movements making it obvious to you that this one is not quite all there and is running on nothing but adrenaline. Spitting the slurred words '...this time I'm gonna get you!', he charges forward!";

You don't know how much later you regain consciousness, but as you do, you see your assailant sprawled on the roof right beside you. Seems the leopardman himself must have succumbed to his injuries before he could do anything more to you. Deciding that enough is enough, you pick yourself off the ground and quickly make your way to the roof access door and down the stairs, only slowing down again once you're several blocks distant to the building.";

You're quick enough to slam the door in his face as he tries to follow, then jump down the stairs three or four steps at a time as you go along. By the time you're on the ground floor and sprint out of the door to the street, you're not sure if he's still following you, but you keep on going anyways, not paying any mind to the other groaning leopardman still laying on the sidewalk. After rounding a few blocks you stop and take several deep breaths, relieved that you seem to have gotten away clean.";

He sputters a few breaths and then you hear him mumble, '...god-damned blue devil...', before he goes out like a light. Looking down upon the fallen opponent, you are left with the open questions of what on earth he meant, let alone what actually transpired here on this roof. In that instant however, you come to be aware of two things. First, the sense of being watched has not abated at all, in fact it is as strong as ever before. Second, you feel a definite presence on the roof, and it is not any of the bodies around you. Whirling around with grim determination to face down who- or whatever else might have shown up, you are greeted with a sight that suddenly makes the words of the fallen assailant ring true.";
				say "     Standing on the edge of the rooftop one building over is a towering figure that looks over seven feet tall, with deep sky blue skin. The figure appears to be a male, with a muscular but not overly bulky body that is extremely well defined - from his broad shoulders and strong arms, over a chiseled chest down to remarkably toned legs. He is adorned with a white loincloth that flutters slightly in the breeze, held in place by a metal belt around his hips, and also is wearing some kind of ribbon around his left bicep. Some kind of bandage-wraps are tied around palms and wrists, stained red with blood in some places. Looking up at his face, you find that he has sharp and attractive human features plus a pair of long slender horns emerging from his forehead and arching slightly backwards. A mass of shoulder-length spiky white hair frames the picture, some of which seems done up in braids. A 'Blue Devil' indeed.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     The being standing before you and calmly eying you up and down is likely responsible for the carnage that befell all on this rooftop, yet somehow you don't feel threatened by him at all. Meeting the blue devil's gaze head on, you see him cock his head to the side with what almost looks like an amused expression, then bare a side-grin and even ever so subtly licks his lip. In the next instant, he makes a step forward - right off the roof. Exhaling the breath you finally realize you had been holding onto all this time, you rush over to the edge and... see only an empty street below - well, except the still recuperating leopardman pancaked on the sidewalk, who won't be getting up anytime soon.";
				say "     Finding yourself alone on the roof, not counting the unconscious bodies, you finally decide that enough is enough and make your way back to the roof access door exit, only stopping briefly to grab a bottle of water that lies on the way. Exiting the building a few minutes later, you ignore the unconscious leopardman still on the ground and look back up towards the roof, the memory of the carnage and the creature who likely caused it still strong and fresh in your mind. The look he gave you before he vanished is something you won't forget anytime soon.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     A part of you can only help but wonder if there is a way to find out more about what you witnessed. Maybe returning to this location at another time could yield some information. The inhabitants of the area no doubt fled when things started to get hairy, but they're likely be back at some point.";

You quickly make your way down the stairs and straight out of the door, not paying any mind to the groaning leopardman still laying on the sidewalk. After rounding a few blocks you stop and take several deep breaths, relieved that the no one seems to have seen or followed you. You mentally mark that area as one to avoid in the future.";

		say "     Returning to the location where you encountered the rooftop battle and the mysterious 'blue devil', you find that the area at this time is much more populated, with a definite crowd of people hanging around the building where the incident took place. You decide upon moving up to the throng of partially and fully transformed people, trying to pick up what tidbits of conversation they are gossiping about. In particular, you pay close attention to a trio of individuals, an older man sporting jaguar fur holding a bottle of beer, a young man who's still almost completely human and a lizard-like woman, who are discussing the aftermath of what happened before.";
		say "     There is some speculation about it being gang violence, until the younger man suddenly speaks up. 'I heard one of them say it was the Blue Devil...' The older man quickly interjects, 'Hah! that dumb rumor again? Look, there's a lot of crazy shit in this city, and granted some really tough critters out there, but a devil? No, it's simply just another gang war that went bad for all sides and they're making up excuses for such a disaster. Hell, that makes far more sense than believing there's a way even one creature could take out that entire mob in that manner.' The woman who'd been noticeably quiet since the devil was brought up suddenly speaks up 'He's real! Maybe like you said he didn't cause all that, but he's still real! My friends saw him once after something similar like this happened, and thank goodness they had the sense to run away. I've heard stories about the things he does... and I don't mean the fighting...' The older man regards her with a 'here we go again' kind of look and takes a pull of his beer, the younger one simply stares on.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     '...I mean how he uses people like nothing,' the woman continues, 'He's a freak who preys on others for his own selfish deviancy!' The older man had apparently been holding onto a guffaw and blurts it out with a remark, 'Dear, you've just described probably 90% of this damned city - you realize that right?' Undeterred, the woman keeps on with 'Oh but he's worse! Most of those out there are mindless crazy things. He's not. He knows exactly what he's doing and it's disgusting! Hide your women, hell, hide your men from what I've heard!' The two men shift uncomfortably at that, looking up as if they were expecting the demon to jump them right then and there, so do several of the nearby citizens who were drawn to the conversation.";
		say "     The woman looks at you earnestly. 'Trust me. You ever see him, you run.' With that she strolls off on her way, several of the citizens giving her smug looks and some mumbling remarks about her sanity. The older man coughs and shakes his head. 'Uhh...yeeaaah... as I said, just gang fighting gone bad and nothing more.' He takes another drink and walks away into the crowd mumbling 'fucking crazy bitch' under his breath. The younger man apparently also took his leave as you did not even notice his departure.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     As the crowd disperses, you take another look up at the rooftops and reminisce over your encounter while trying to parse the new information you've learned. He was no figment of imagination that's for certain, sure it was brief, but you saw the blue devil all the same. You begin to walk along the sidewalk trying to make sense of it all, thinking about how while it was clearly no ordinary gang fight, you cannot discount what the man said about how it was not possible one creature could have taken out so many others. Moving with such focus you barely take notice of a sound to your right.";
		say "     'Psst. Hey.' Looking over you see the younger man of the trio standing in an alley, he looks at you with an eager expression. 'You seemed pretty interested in us talking. Do you want to know more about the blue devil? I've got some things I could tell you...' He waves you over. Nodding your head, you approach him and he slowly makes his way further down the alley. 'Don't want anyone to see us,' he mentions somewhat nervously. As you reach a good distance further inwards, the young man suddenly whirls around and says 'Time for you to get talking.' In a complete change of his tone of voice and posture as well, he drops the act and gives you a threatening glare.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The man walks forward with menace, 'You're not from around here and suddenly turn up asking questions about the devil. That means you're working for one of them. So which is it then? The military? The cult?' He continues marching forward while you walk backwards in utter confusion from his abrupt change and words. You curse as your back hits the side of a dumpster and suddenly you find yourself cornered. The man stops in front of you, 'I'll ask one more time. What do you know? And who do you work for?' Feeling some renewed vigor, you sternly look him in the eye and state you have no idea what he's talking about. The man laughs and continues, 'Hah! You expect me to believe you're just some random moron?' He pulls out a long baton. 'Oh well, there's one way to find out!'";

Oh well. Let this be a lesson to you about curiosity and dead cats and all that.' He grins wickedly and moves on his way. After some time, you manage to gather yourself up and leave the alley to continue on your way, having learnt quite a painful lesson indeed.";

He slumps to the ground against the wall and you decide to see if he's still in a chatty mood. Sadly, the blow on the head seems to have knocked his marbles around a bit, so all you get is a slurred '...they said... anyone who asks about devil... make them talk...' before the falls unconscious. Even more curious than before, you regard the comatose body of the assailant and decide to search him. There's not much on him at first glance, though you do acquire a bottle of water and some chips. In one of his pockets however is something really interesting - a bunch of blurry photos.";

The third image shows a heavy spiked club - a really old one from the looks of it, fit to be in a museum. The fourth image is of a human man, a very young adult or even teenager. Someone has drawn a target over his face. The final image is hardest to make out given how blurry it is. It looks like it was taken in great haste in a scuffle of some kind. Studying the image closer, you make out the shape of what appears to be an arm thrusting out towards whoever was holding the camera. Following that outline, you can make out the origin of the arm and your eyes widen upon realizing you are looking at a face, with two horns, and the knowledge that you've seen that face before. Looks pretty much the same even with all the blur, could swear he's even got that same side-grin.";

As an ever increasing uneasy sensation washes over you, you decide to pocket the photographs and leave the would-be assailant out cold. Departing the alley, you continue along your way walking on the sidewalk, a bit frustrated in finding only more and more questions. Yet there something enticing about the whole mystery too, and you cannot help but think that, with all the rumors of the blue devil around here, he must be around often. Maybe if you keep exploring the area you might find out more.";

After some time searching through nearby properties and structures, without any result, you start thinking about turning back to other matters, but then suddenly you catch the sound of a shout, followed by several more. Instinctively you look up, wary of falling bodies - thankfully there are none - and listening more closely you realize that the sounds seem to be coming more from the ground level this time.";
		say "     Following the noise you wind up in an alleyway, with whatever is happening just around the next corner. But as you slowly and stealthily move forward to peek around it, everything falls silent again. Arriving at the corner, you have a look and see an undeveloped area between buildings - bearing a similar scene like on the rooftop. Wounded people lying on the ground all over the place, thankfully unconscious while the nanites slowly rectify the wounds all over their mangled forms. The scents and images of all the carnage give you a slightly nauseous feeling and again you feel a strong sensation of being watched.";

Deep in thought about the events that must have occurred here just a short while ago, you casually nudge over a severed forearm to its owner and see it start to grow back on when the ends meet.

One of them addresses the others, barking 'What the fuck is this?' with a look of angry disappointment. 'Sure as hell ain't the blue devil standing there.' The others nod in agreement. 'But there sure as no chance in hell this punk did all of this.' He gestures to the remnants strewn about.";

We put this sorry ass bunch out there to corner the devil and not only did they get themselves sliced to ribbons, they didn't even slow him down for us to finish either!'

	say "     Gazing upon the form of the big man this close made you realize that your previous glimpse of him didn't do any justice. Sure all the details are the same, but now the creature's size and figure are even more apparent, with musculature so chiseled they might as well have been cut from stone, a feat even more impressive considering that his figure isn't super bulky and proportioned quite well. Staring up at his face, you can see a bit more detail in his expression now, a face that - while clearly demonic - also has a handsome look to it. He may have horns and sharp teeth, but the calm expression and friendly smile make up for it. His eyes look to be a deep magenta with black irises and bright red slitted pupils, and the glowing look he's giving you is almost one of mirth.";
	say "     'You did good,' he says before adding, 'I'm a bit surprised they jumped you instead of trolling around for me. Hah - maybe I hit [']em a bit too hard in the head last time and knocked a few screws loose. And still it didn't help [']em any - they sure know whom to pick for their daily beatings.' The demonic-looking man gives a casual shrug as he looks over the unconscious gang-members, then turns back to you, his eyes still shining as he gives you a once-over. Placing one hand on his chest while the other clasps your shoulder, he gruffly states, 'Call me Rane,' followed by a slight nod and the question, 'And you?' Taking note of his firm grip of his large hand, you offer up your name, but before you can state anything more, you find yourself drawn against him, as Rane has quickly slipped his arm around your waist.";

'I'm strong myself. I love kicking ass... love fucking ass too.' In a show of emphasis he flexes the muscles in his free arm and legs while tightening his grip around your ass, his gaze is wandering up and down your body. Before you can react to his brazen touches, he suddenly removes his hand and takes up a more neutral stance. He's a pretty direct and physical guy, clearly liking to play grab-ass, but it seems that (unlike most creatures out on the streets) Rane knows the boundary between being a somewhat pushy charmer and flat out forcing sex on people.";
	say "     Meeting your gaze with his own and giving an inquisitive, yet amused expression, the blue man smiles and asks in an enticingly rough voice, 'What's a nice piece of tail like you doing in this area, mixing it up with the gutter rats?' You offer a brief summary of your time in the city, glossing over the more 'interesting' adventures, not wanting to encourage this clearly horny devil eying you like a piece of meat. You get to the part where you first met up with Rane, pointing out how he almost dropped a leopardman on your head. The devil says with a snicker, 'Wasn't aiming for you,' then cranes his neck a bit to look at your ass and continues in a joking tone, 'Believe me, I don't miss if I set my mind to hit... on someone.' He shrugs and says, 'It was a lucky throw. Might not have run into you otherwise. Still... I guess I'll have to be more careful when I throw people off buildings in the future.' You're not sure if he is actually joking with that last part. Given just the little bit of Rane's track-record that you know, things like that could be a common occurrence for him.";

He licks his lips, showing a row of sharp teeth in the progress, then says 'It really gets me hard.' Your eyes are reflexively drawn to his crotch and notice a very prominent bulge on display there, showing this demon is not all talk. Before anything else can happen, Rane suddenly raises a finger to his lips, making a 'shhh' sound and turns his head a bit, listening intently with pointy ears. You don't hear anything, but he says, 'What fucking timing. Several large groups of more shitheads are on the way. As much as I love a good fight, I'm 'distracted' with something better.' You jump a bit as you again feel Rane give your ass another quick squeeze. 'Let's continue this somewhere more 'private'...'

Even going as fast as you can, you're steadily losing ground, but at least you manage to keep him in sight until he enters the City Park. Following into the overgrown park you quickly realize that you lost track of him and before you know it are stumbling aimlessly through the vegetation, almost positive now that you're lost.

He is clearly male, with taut muscles over his big, but still lithe and flexible body. Beginning at broad shoulders and strong arms, his body looks fit for a masterfully crafted statue, with well-defined pecs and an impressive eight-pack of abs. Below the abs, you see his only real piece of clothing - a white loincloth, held in place by a metal belt around his hips. Completing the inspection of his body, your gaze then wanders over his long and toned legs and ends up at the oni's feet with their claw-like nails.";

Roughly laughing at his own joke, Rane continues, 'The fastest cure for that is to suck on them like lemons... mine are just as firm.' He gives you a wicked, yet playful smile to go with that. Then he steps up to you, close enough so you can feel the warmth of his skin, and runs a hand enticingly down your side. 'But really - the only thing you need to know is when I'm ready to give you a hard fuck. Which means almost always, for a sexy thing like you.' Giving your ass a playful squeeze, he saunters off, though not without giving you a meaningful wink over his shoulder.";

He chuckles at that and gives his hips a subtle grind while winking in your direction, though as if reminded of something, he continues, 'Yes, Oni have long big clubs... - the iron kind that they take with them everywhere and use for battle.'

'Well, I can tell you lots of stuff, though the words are more of an afterthought...' At that, Rane stops to stand behind you and pushes up against your backside. Even through your clothing you feel the heat off his skin, and especially feel his semi-hard shaft poking in between your ass cheeks. His hot breath makes you shiver as he continues, 'Once I start fucking a nice tight ass, it'll be hard for me to keep quiet. I think you get the point.' He disengages from behind you and walks off with a very pleased grin, leaving you with serious thoughts of following him.";

Stepping up right next to him, you hear the large oni take a few quick breaths through his nose, as if sniffing for something. Then he turns to you and says, 'Hey, have you seen our little college buddy? I'm wondering why his scent has faded so much. Ah, that grade A pussy just has the most enticing... What? Don't tell me you didn't smell it. He's practically been begging to get pounded! Man, you people really should learn to use your noses.' Rane taps his with a finger, then shrugs.

Making a fist and hitting his open palm demonstratively, the blue oni asks, 'Now why the hell would he do that?'

Rane's eyes widen as he realizes you were entirely serious. 'What?! No! Eric's my buddy. The sweet cuntboy I've...' You interrupt at that point, continuing with the words that he's been making use of Eric whenever he wanted - pushing the young man to have sex, overwhelming his will to refuse before he could even get a word out. All of which frightened Eric deeply - as he still is dealing with all the changes going through him. Bodily and mentally, he's still adjusting to the reality of his new self. And Rane just used him as his slut - not exactly gently either.";

Rane utters the final word in a bestial howl, taking a few deep breaths afterwards to try and compose himself, his words now full of remorse. 'I really have no excuse to have acted like I did. Getting carried away that much, letting my true demon beast out fully. And you're sure he...' Rane's eyes search yours out almost pleadingly, but you can offer him no redemption, only nodding and recounting how scared and vulnerable Eric is.

Pushing away from the railing, Rane starts to walk towards the stairs leading down.

Driving away anyone and anything that might impede your progress, even kicking aside several the burned-out wrecks of cars standing in the way, Rane leads you through the urban wasteland with record speed, until he eventually jerks to a stop at the entrance of an alley. You're able to catch up with him, still breathing hard, and see what the big oni is looking at a moment later. It's Eric, almost at the other end of the alley, the strap of his heavy sports bag over one shoulder and loosely clutching a baseball bat in one hand.

Then he glimpses you past the blue oni, and his expression flashes over into anger, 'You! You promised I'd be safe with you. After Rane took advantage of me, I thought it was not your fault for having a demon as a friend. For letting this beast stay with you too, but now you're HELPING him get me!' Tears of betrayal run down the young man's face as he screams, 'I never wanna see either of you again!' After a swing of the baseball bat in your direction, he turns and runs, stumbling a little in his haste to get away.";

We got to talk,' comes Rane's shout and the oni bursts forward in a rapid tempo, which only results in Eric panicking even more, looking over his shoulder as he dashes out of the alley. Right into a little pack of three hellhounds waiting for him with slavering jaws, howling in malicious glee as they pounce on their newest prey. The college athlete manages to dodge the first hellhound baying for his blood, but not without being slowed down, and a second one gets a hold of his shoe and wrenches the young man off his feet. Going down with a yelp, Eric barely has time to roll over on his back and bring the baseball bat up, jamming it between the hellhounds jaws sideways as it tries to tear at his throat.";

Then Rane is there, joining the fight with a jumping leg kick that throws the canine beast to the side with the snap of several bones breaking where the oni's foot connects, its ribcage partially caved in. The third of the trio of demonic hounds looks at the four-way brawl between his two pack-mates, Rane and Eric, then lets his head whip around to (presumably) easier prey - yourself. With a howl, the beast attacks... or tries to, as the blue oni catches its tail with a lightning-quick move, wrenching the hound backwards.";
			say "     The fight that follows is surprisingly quick and remarkably brutal, as Rane takes all of them on at once. You try to join in a time or two, but with the oni acting as a merciless whirlwind of destruction and maiming, there isn't really a chance to do so. He's clearly used to fighting alone, and you'd just get in the way - of him punching and kicking the hounds to keep them off Eric. As you watch intently, you cannot help but notice that Eric is also watching Rane closely, unable to not be amazed at the oni moving with such power, his flowing agility despite a large form and thick muscles. With the oni's exceptional combat skills, his fight against the hounds works out fairly well, even if it is three on one - until two of the beasts perform a joint attack, allowing the third to jump Eric again, pulling him down to the ground to hit his head on the concrete sidewalk with a resounding thunk. Seeing Eric lie in a boneless heap on the ground, Rane goes completely wild, and what previously was a no holds barred fight now becomes a pandemonium of violence.";

The sound that follows reminds you of a melon being thrown out of a window - and even without looking closely at the gory mess, you're fairly sure that this demon won't be getting up again, ever.";

The blue oni gives a pleased sigh at your initiative, confidently standing bare-ass naked before you and allowing you to take in all of him. Under a thick bush of spiky white pubic hair, Rane's respectably big manhood dangles down between those chiseled legs of his - or at least at first it does. Reveling in your attention, the blue man's shaft rises and expands, getting harder and longer by the moment. Starting out big, it really becomes quite a sight to behold - thick and long to match the scale of the rest of him. For a moment you think it might not stop growing, but then it finally reaches its full extension, now standing erect pointing at you in a slight upward angle.";

Like the rest of his body, it's the details which stand out, and you definitely take notice of enlarged bulging veins running along its length, which by your estimate is somewhere in the vicinity of a foot long, though that's maybe a bit modest. Underneath, you catch glimpse of what looks to be a very firm scrotum holding two about softball-sized testicles. While you had your eyes firmly riveted to his crotch, Rane's hands in the meantime were busy wandering over your body and feeling you up - until he acts right now, quickly pulling down and discarding your lower clothing.";

He grins at your reflection, turning sideways to allow you to see him stroke his massively long and hard shaft past your own mirror image, then he takes position right behind you. You can feel the warmth of his manhood resting against your lower back, then slide deeper to nestle between your buttcheeks as Rane moves a bit. While playfully slapping his cock against your cheeks, he gathers a bit of spit and puts it on a hand, rubbing it over his shaft a moment later. The oni gropes your cheeks with both hands, then pulls them apart and sets the bulbous head of his manhood against your pucker.";

There is something bestial about the wide, fang-showing grin on Rane's face, only strengthened by the way his eyes are glowing right now and the fact that there's a deep and lusty growl coming from him chest. Maybe giving yourself into the hands of this powerful and sexual beast wasn't such a great idea after all, a tiny tiny voice speaks up through the haze of sexual need in your mind.

Firstly, you become aware of the very full feeling that his monstrously big, throbbing presence leaves deep inside you.

I'm gonna fuck you till you can't stand straight!', 'You like that, little bitch, don't you?' and 'Can't get enough of your little fuckhole.' The onslaught is nearly too much to bear, the combined sensations drowning everything else out: His long, thick and warm pillar of cock, moving swiftly in and out.

Last time you looked, you mainly saw and focused on Rane's demonic appearance and demeanor, but while you can't deny that he is an oni and does like to have pretty rough and hard sex - that's all there is to it. Having felt him change the angle of his thrusts to give you more pleasure, and go slow just a second when you really needed it, you now see the man inside the devil - lusty and wild, but also caring - making sure that he doesn't actually hurt you, no matter how rough things get.";

His breathing is becoming ragged and his grunts are becoming louder, in addition to his voice becoming just a bit hoarse. Your own climax is not too far away either, the thick column of meat impaling you having stimulated your body very thoroughly, building a slow flame that is set to erupt. And feeling the firm testicles of your demonic lover smack directly against your lower privates each time your bodies connect is quite a nice sensation too.";

Feeling the massive oni cock pulse in your tightly stretched hole, you immediately become aware of the massive flood of hot cum he blasts into you. Rane's body spasms several times against you, each time delivering another torrent of warmth inside. That sensation in and of itself is enough to drive you over the edge yourself, so you grip on to the railing tightly and pant in lust, your own fluids splashing down on the ground in front of you.

A whole torrent of creamy white cum leaks out as he does so, dripping down to pools on the ground beneath you. You watch as Rane moves with as little coordination as you've ever seen from him, nearly stumbling to lean against one of the shrine pillars, still in his breathless euphoria. Perhaps not feeling quite as winded as he, though still quite worn out, you slowly move towards your discarded clothing and begin dressing, keeping an eye on your blue friend as he continues to catch his breath.

With a quick push, the flexible metal band falls away, immediately followed by the now no longer secured white fabric of his loincloth. Now confidently standing bare-ass naked before you, the blue man allows you to take in all of him and even sinuously moves his hips a bit to show off. Under a thick bush of spiky white pubic hair, Rane's respectably big manhood dangles down between those chiseled legs of his - or at least at first it does. Reveling in your attention, the blue man's shaft rises and expands, getting harder and longer by the moment. Starting out big, it really becomes quite a sight to behold - thick and long to match the scale of the rest of him.

Underneath, you catch glimpse of what looks to be a very firm scrotum holding two about softball-sized testicles.

You work your lips further down over his cock each time, taking his thick meat down your throat while your tongue plays along it.

You suck it down as best you can, his heavy flow easily filling your mouth and flowing down into your belly. Even gulping it down as quickly as possible, some overflows from your lips, staining his blue flesh with streaks of white. His cum has a strong taste, but is delicious nonetheless, its musky flavor speaking of its rich, virile nature. And certainly there's plenty of it as well, allowing you to enjoy a tasty meal of oni semen that fills your belly with sloshing, hot cum. Once his long climax comes to an end, Rane releases your head and allows you to slide off his softening shaft to take panting breaths. Then his arm on your shoulder pulls you back to your feet, allowing your blue friend to meet your messy lips with his and share a creamy kiss. 'You're a great cocksucker,' Rane compliments, then leans down to grab his loincloth and belt again to get dressed.";

The tall oni waits for you to approach with his hands on his hips, humming to himself - until you say that you want to fuck him. 'Oh, do you? If that's so, why don't you... make me?' With that, Rane presses the release of his belt's fastening and lets the segmented metal band and his loincloth fall to the ground. The now bare-ass naked oni then strides over to one of the reading areas, pushing the table and sofas off its large and soft carpet. Taking a pretty suggestive wrestling-stance that puts his nude body into full view, he calls out 'Come on - earn your right to stick it in.'";
	say "     It's clear that Rane is toying with you, with the enticing poses he takes and the playful tone audible in his voice, so you decide to go for it, just dropping your gear and stepping on the carpet. Licking his lips, then wiggling his long tongue at you, Rane teases 'Willing to go all the way to get some action, I see. But can you really hope to win? Just look at what you'll be up against...' He brushes a hand over his own bulging pecs, then his ripped abs and further down until he's got his big cock in hand to wave it at you. After another few moments of this, the blue oni drops the act and gets into a real wrestling pose. Seems like the fight is on - for real, now.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Stepping up to meet Rane head on, you try to gauge the right time to strike, see an opening and... find yourself whirling in the air to land on your back in a thankfully cushioned fall on the carpet. The oni is FAST - really fast. He leans over you, looking down with a smirk, and says 'You'll have to do better than that if you want something from me...' Then he steps back and waits for you to get back up, again posing to show off his muscles and impressive manhood. As he seems happy to stay in a purely defensive posture, you're free to try again - and again, as he just evades your moves easily.";
	say "     You decide to try a different approach, feinting in one direction, then hitting Rane unexpectedly from the other. And it almost works... he moves as if to deflect your deception - then suddenly a slapping noise and movement from the corner of your eye draws your attention - it's Rane's cock, swinging pendulously between his legs as the oni shakes his hips, smacking against his toned legs left and right. That moment of distraction is enough to find yourself suddenly whirled around on your back on the carpet. Kneeling over you with his back to your face, Rane looks over his shoulder and chuckles 'Well, you were interested in my ass - so here it is. How about you show me some nice service...' With that, he leans back a bit, putting his firmly toned butt right in front of you. Reaching back to pull apart his cheeks, he bares his hole to you and adds 'Come on, I'm waiting.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Well, you wanted to get in his ass - and now you can, with your tongue at least. Raising your head a little bit allows you to lap at the blue oni's crack and you search out his wrinkled pucker with the tip of your tongue to poke and tease it. 'Yeah, just like that. Eat my ass!' Rane groans above you, moaning loudly as you as you push against his hole and find that it readily allows entrance to you. Relishing in your oral attention, Rane lets you continue for a while, then he stands up and looks down at you. Stroking his thick manmeat, he says in a teasing voice 'Don't you see that you can't win a regular fight against me?' After that, he steps aside with light steps, allowing you to get up yourself.";
	say "     Hm, so you can't win a 'regular' fight against him. Why not make it an irregular one... you do what Rane himself did - you strip, giving the oni a really nice show as piece by piece, your clothing gets removed and thrown aside. Your blue-skinned opponent pays close attention as you do so, vocally encouraging you to drop the next and the next article of clothing and even making suggestions like 'Why don't you just stop fighting and let me fuck you - right here, right now? I'll make you scream my name as you come.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Not letting yourself get deterred that easily, you finally step forward again when you're as naked as Rane is. He may be an amazing fighter, but... he's also an incorrigible horn-dog who gives you salacious looks and gets distracted, so you do actually have a chance now. A bit of back-and-forth follows, one of you getting a grip on the other till he winds out of it, but finally, you're able to hook a foot behind Rane's leg and pull it out from under him, bringing the blue oni down on his back. Immediately following up, you get down on the carpet with him, taking hold of his legs and lifting them, pushing up towards his chest. In the process of doing so, your by now fully hard cock rubs against Rane's butt, poking at his pucker as it is in just the right position now.";
	say "     'I yield! You've shown me that I just can't stand against your power,' Rane says with a chuckle, then continues, 'Now I can't do anything but lie helpless under you and wait for the victor to ravish me.' Something tells you that he let you win, but then... who cares. On to the spoils. Letting Rane take and hold up his own legs, you put a hand on your hard [cock of player] cock, then push its head against the oni's rear entrance. As before with your tongue, his opening easily allows you entrance and you sink right in, plunging deep into Rane's body and making him pant in lust. 'Yeah, deeper! Fuck me hard!' he shouts, and you're of course more than willing to comply...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     It's an empowering experience to see this blue man lying on his back before you, panting and moaning as you take his ass. That toned, powerful body, his strong arms holding both legs up and his horned head resting on the soft carpet, rearing up and gasping each time you do an especially deep thrust. Thinking back to your first sexual encounter, the time he bent you over and fucked you at the shrine like a wild beast, you find yourself amazed how versatile the oni is, giving himself so fully to the pleasures of getting fucked by you. Though his usual domineering behavior still shines through even now - as he gasps out 'Jerk my cock as you fuck me!' in a throaty, deep voice.";
	say "     Putting a hand on Rane's thick shaft and cupping his large balls with the other, you stroke and fondle the oni while still grinding your hips against his butt. His large cock lies warm and heavy in your hand, twitching a bit in reaction to you pounding the blue oni's butt. Putting both hands on it to handle the big organ, you jerk him off, driving his arousal higher and higher. It's only a question of time before the big oni suddenly shouts 'I'm gonnna cummmmmMMM!' You can feel his manhood pulse in your hand as burst after burst of cum blasts from its tip to splatter all over Rane's chest. At the same time his hole rhythmically constricts and flexes around your thrusting cock - which pushes you over the edge right along with the oni only moments later. You've just enough time to bottom out inside him, then your own load gushes forth, filling Rane's tight hole to the brim.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Some time later, as you pull your softening dick out of Rane's ass, the oni gives a satisfied smile and licks his lips. 'We should wrestle more often...' he pants, lazily rubbing in the creamy cum all over his muscled chest.";

Rane ends here.
