Sometimes even a lusty predator like him simply wants to be stroked and comforted. So for now, he is just dozing peacefully on that sofa, his purr rumbling like an idling motor as he enjoys Amy's attention. The young husky herself is pretty happy in being together with him like this, even going so far as to forgetting about the book she must have been reading before, which now lies beside her on the sofa as she strokes the felinoid with both hands.";

The felinoid keeps going for a while, just slow enough so that Amy won't get distracted from her book completely. You can't really tell if it's just meant as a gesture of affection or if he simply wants to spread his scent all over the husky and frighten off any other contenders for her.";

For once showing less of a 'tough bitch' attitude, the former cop comes to stand before Amy and asks, 'What are you reading, gorgeous?' Laying down the book onto her lap, Amy gives a smile and replies, 'It's the Count of Monte Christo. A really gripping story about this man, who...' Lounging beside Amy on the sofa, Alexandra indulges the young woman's excited retelling of story, up to the point where she is in reading it and with Amy's thoughts on what might happen next.";
			say "     Nodding, half to Amy as she finishes her tale and half to herself, Alexandra says, 'You know, I also loved to read, when I was a girl. So many great stories to be experienced between the pages. But... when I became a cop, duty always took precedence and I barely had time anymore, always looking for overtime.' The doberwoman's eyes wander over the bookshelves all around, then she says '...well, screw that. I'm not that foolish idealist anymore and with only a bit of guarding to do... and of course serving the boss with all [if player is purefemale]her[else]his[end if] sexual needs, there's more than enough time for me to spend on myself. Keep reading what you want and don't let anyone but the boss or me talk you out of it - I'm gonna start doing the same.' With that, the doberwoman gives Amy a nod and stands up, striding between two long bookshelves.";

Curious about what topic, you step up a bit closer and overhear the doberwoman say, 'So your mother is a total whore, you were born after a gangbang and then brought here by the boss? Shit, you've almost had it as bad as me - my parents were crooks and criminals. So here we are, a born slut and a tamed slut, both in training. Guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.' Then she tightens her embrace around Amy and pulls her close, before continuing with 'Bah, screw everyone else - now we have the boss, and each other.' Alexandra rubs her muzzle against Amy's neck and says, 'You hear that, girl? If anyone but the boss gives you even a hint of trouble - I'll kick the shit out of them. Least thing I can do...'";
