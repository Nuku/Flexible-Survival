'Which one did the coyote say the food was in?' the shepherd asks gruffly, to which the bulldog replies 'A red one, with Transglobal on the side.' Looking up and down the lines of containers, the shepherd wails 'But almost all of them are red!' The bulldog shrugs and walks over to the nearest container and opens it up. 'Oh hey, seventy flatsceen TVs - how... useless, without electricity. Let's check the next one.' The two of them open up several more containers, but find nothing of use in this post-apocalyptic city.";
			say "     'I'm beginning to think Diego sent us on a wild goose chase,' the shepherd growls. 'OK, OK... let's just open up this last one, then go back to the park and have some words with that coyote...' his buddy replies, then pulls open another container and yelps in surprise. 'Now that's freaky - for a moment I thought this container was full of people.' The German shepherd steps in front of the door and looks in too. 'Nah, those are just those dress dummies they use in stores. Normal lifeless puppets, see...' and pokes the first mannequin in the container in the chest - which promptly grabs him by the arm. Within moments, dozens of mannequins pour out of the container and wrestle both dogs to the ground. They jostle against each other with a desperate tenacity, each trying to touch one of their captives. Then you see them change, taking on characteristics of the dogs - one growing out a muzzle, another suddenly sprouting fur, with all of them jostling against each other, in a frantic way.";

Left behind on the ground are two more mannequins - those must be the two former dogs, their essence drained away. As they start to get up too, you decide it's time to leave and make your way back to the hole in the fence. One of the mannequins got there before you, though. It might have absorbed the knowledge of its location from the dogs, or just have been lucky. Now it turns to you, eager to make your shape its own.";

It has a pale flesh-colored skin-tone and a chiseled-looking face including sculpted wavy hair. As the mannequin notices you, an almost desperate, needful look crosses its face and it rushes at you.";

			say "     As you succumb to the infection, the feeling of being empty inside overwhelms you. Being a nondescript, almost faceless husk, without even a heartbeat or needing to breathe, desperation grips your mind. You hunger to be someone - anyone really, and start drifting aimlessly through the city, searching for others. The first few people and creatures you encounter run away or fight you off, but eventually you manage to overpower someone, wrestling them down. Hands tightly grasping your victim, you steal what makes them someone, makes them real. For a few fleeting moments, you feel hope as your skin ripples and shifts, taking on the lifelike guise of your captive while the poor soul you caught becomes more and more nondescript. By the end, you look alive, look real, yet as the drained shape of your victim stumbles away, the realization strikes that you are still empty, on the inside. All you did was pass this cursed existence to someone else, and your attempts to act naturally in your stolen shape fail again and again. Eventually, you give up completely, becoming numb to the world and acting the part of a mannequin. Just standing around, enduring your fate. Forever.";
			stop the action; [no other endings - player removed from the city]
		else:
			say "     Remaining in control of the urges to acquire the shapes of others and become them, you experiment a bit and perfect this ability by taking some parts of creatures you need, without leaving them completely drained. When the military finally moves in, you're taken to a holding facility, where doctors poke and prod you for days on end. Overhearing two doctors talk, you catch '...ites active and in constant flux. The subject wasn't exposed to a one-time change, but something else. That makes [if Player is male]him[else if Player is female]her[else]it[end if] far too dangerous to be released. I recommend perm...' Since you don't think you'd get out of there alive - if at all, you use the next chance you get with an orderly and overpower him to flee the facility after absorbing his shape. There's quite a bit of panic when people find the mindless mannequin this leaves behind, which instantly attacks the next person opening the door to the storeroom you locked it in. By the time the chaos is quelled and they realize that you're gone, it's far too late to stop you with roadblocks, as you have already gained a new identity, mixed and matched from people you encounter and partially drain. It's touch and go for a while, but you manage to avoid capture.";
			say "     A week later and several hundred miles distant, having switched shapes several times along the way, you're lying low in a small town. You think you're home free - until you walk into your motel room and find a man in a suit waiting for you. 'Quite impressive, your escape. You should not have left a trail of witnesses though - those you drained were quite noticeable, since you did not dispose of them.' A shrug follows, with him taking a drag from a cigarette, then blowing out the smoke. 'Guess you'll learn. We need people with abilities like yours...' Recognizing a deal you can't decline, you let yourself be recruited and end up a spy, traveling all over the world. Your ability to become anyone you want to be creates a rumor, then a legend of the super-spy 'The Chameleon'. Eventually movie-directors get a hold of the story and bring out an award-winning series of films about you. You make a game out of appearing as a minor role in every last one of them - never in the same shape twice though, draining criminals and pimps that no one will miss to go to auditions. Rumors abound years later, as fans spot that someone winks at the camera in a specific way, in every single movie.";

Stolen Lives	"Stolen Lives"

Stolen Lives is a situation.
Stolen Lives is inactive.
ResolveFunction of Stolen Lives is "[ResolveEvent Stolen Lives]".
Sarea of Stolen Lives is "Warehouse".

to say ResolveEvent Stolen Lives:
	say "     Wandering through the streets at the very edge of the warehouse district, you explore an area with long rows of smaller brick buildings instead of the massive metal warehouses further in. Looks like it's mostly small commercial enterprises and production places, judging by the fairly utilitarian signs some buildings bear. The whole area seems pretty empty, with few beings visible in the grid-patterned streets. Not too surprising, as it's far from any residential area, and few people would pick their workplace to weather the nanite apocalypse in.

Maybe there's some reason that everyone avoids it, you wonder, only to suddenly hear a clattering thud, from somewhere ahead behind the warehouse to your right. Steeling your nerves, you slowly walk that way and glance around the corner, seeing that a side door of the warehouse is standing open a crack. Did a gust of wind make it swing and cause that noise?

It's not like any of them will come alive and attack you, right!? Oh, wait... You shake your head to dispel the thought and just step inside, passing the first bunch of mannequins, standing in a closely packed bunch near the side door. Gazing at the next one beyond that, you jump as it seems to move its head, only to you realize you're staring at your own distorted face reflected back at you. This thing has a golden-metallic oval for a head, polished up to mirror shine! The arms are also mirrored and golden, fading to black plastic halfway up to the elbow. Creepy! The mannequin doesn't move as you step past it, into the midst of the hundreds of silent shapes standing throughout the part of the warehouse you can make out right now. Whoever sorted this place must have had an odd way of organization, as the humanoid dolls in here are sometimes standing in straight lines, others bunched up, and others again as singletons. Before coming here, you don't think you ever knew just how many different types of mannequins there are. So many different poses, materials, apparent ages, head shapes or absences thereof.";

Somehow, concentrating on the individuals makes you feel a little bit better about being in this large, dark place, surrounded by thousands of these things. You even try out moving articulated arms if they have them, getting the relieved confirmation that they're inanimate objects. Exploring further, you weave in and out between the silent rows. Then suddenly, a realization strikes you and you freeze mid-motion. That over there, in the edge of your vision, that's not a mannequin, is it?! Slowly turning your head, you see that there is a slender anthro deer standing in the mass of puppets, unmoving and silent, wearing a tight white tank-top that seems almost painted onto his flat chest. He looks like a young buck, with somewhat unruly brown hair out of which two-pointed antlers stick up.";
		WaitLineBreak;

He isn't breathing, or blinking, just stands there on his slender hooves and looks neutrally into the distance. In fact, you've seen his exact pose and posture countless times during your exploration of the warehouse - standing man #4, by your own count of the various mannequin shapes. Driven by curiosity, you hesitantly reach out and touch the buck's upper arm, then brush your fingers up to the edge of the shirt on his chest, feeling soft fur and actual warmth to him, but no other signs of life. His eyes don't focus on you when you look into them, yet the anthro isn't stiff like the mannequins all around. His arms move when you pull on them, even hold a position, but there doesn't seem to be any will that drives the buck to do anything on his own. Experimenting some more, you take the deer by the hand and walk a few steps, finding him walking along silently as you look over your shoulder.";
		say "     Perhaps you let yourself get a bit too distracted by this odd being you found, because while still looking back the next thing that happens is that you bump into someone ahead of you. Someone tall, with firm muscle covered in short fur. Whipping your head around, you are shocked to see a horseman, and one you recognize. Standing amidst the mannequins in what you registered as herculean pose #2, one arm lifted and flexing, is a naked and impressively built Clydesdale. Remembering the last time you saw this being, you recall [']his['] original being hunted down by a mannequin, absorbing the shape and appearance of an anthro equine who was sent to capture it. Yet when the transformed mannequin then tried to act the part, be more than a hollow puppet, it failed spectacularly. As a newly formed horseman, it was unfamiliar to normal movements and apparently not even realized that he'd need to breathe to speak. Now he's standing here, motionless and posed, not reacting to being touched or spoken to any more than the young buck.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Looking over your shoulder, you see the deer standing just a step or two behind you, arm outstretched as it was when you were pulling him. Given their similarities, and just where you found these two, you are fairly certain that the deer is another mannequin that must have absorbed this shape. If you had to guess, they both likely tried to fit in and become their new selves, yet despaired after however many tries. Maybe they then gave up and returned to 'their people' in this warehouse? Or did someone bring them here? Arrange these two like this? Who would do this, and why? Whatever may be the truth, here they are now, as incredibly lifelike dolls with apparently no will of their own. Wondering if there might be more of these transformed mannequins, you glance around and let your gaze sweep over the mass of shapes. There are so many of them in the darkness, yet you don't spot anything but the plastic-y, wooden or metallic shapes of normal mannequins. Who knows, more might arrive or be brought here in the future and be found through a more thorough search. Best not to step away from your two current finds right now, as you might lose your way in the crowd and not find them again.";
		say "     Turning back to the deer and horseman, you contemplate what to do now. While doing so, are struck by the thought that the buck's skinny jeans seem a little [italic type]too[roman type] skinny in the crotch area. Stepping closer, you say more to yourself than him that you got to check for his wallet, maybe find out his name, and slip your hand into the tight pockets of the jeans. There is still no reaction from the buck, so you feel comfortable enough to go ahead and opening the jeans up at the front, allowing you to find out that this deer has one single part that is more doe than buck, as he has a pussy between his legs. Raising your eyebrows at that revelation, you zip him back up and push the lower edge of the tank top back down. While you're exploring, you find yourself pulling open his mouth, and look inside, seeing it perfectly realistic shape, down to a throat going down at the back, and having a moist, soft tongue. The thought of if they need to eat arises in you, and if these beings might just starve if they continue standing here all on their own. Finally, you gently pull down an eyelid, which stays as you place it, then push it up again.";
