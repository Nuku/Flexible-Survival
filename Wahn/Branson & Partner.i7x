She is pretty, with a well-sized pair of assets bulging out the top of her shirt. Two interesting little bumps in the white fabric tell you that she isn't wearing a bra either. While the fur on her body is a mixture of light brown and cream at the front (down from her muzzle over her neck and you assume all the way to her hooves), the anthro furry has shoulder-length black hair, pulled into a ponytail behind her head.";

The guards at the mall keep most of those away anyways, and after my boss Mr. B took care of a few hard-headed cases, they avoid this building at any cost.' An undertone of worshipful admiration fills her voice as she talks of this 'Mr. B' and thanks to the mostly see-through glass front of the reception desk you can see her hand stroke the inside of her crossed legs.

This is where bureaucrats and statisticians have their offices, doing their important yet often overlooked work. It seems like that latter fact works in your favor right now - as the building seems to have been completely ignored in the time since the nanite outbreak. No signs of looting or habitation at all. Just an abandoned office building, waiting for you to gain entrance.";
	say "     It is fairly easy to smash one of the windows on the back side, climbing into the open office filled with cubicles. Standing between the little box-shaped pens for human workers is somewhat eerie, making you feel like you don't belong here. Shaking off the sensation, you quickly move on and check doors left and right in an adjoining hallway - restrooms, office supply cupboard, a few one person offices, then - AHA - the server room!

Further back is a smallish cube of softly humming technology, connected to several long-lasting battery systems. That seems like the thing that Branson described - the city hall datastore. Seems they set it up so the thing wouldn't be damaged in a sudden power loss.";

A heading of 'Backup Datastore' glows in a soothing green on the other hand, indicating that at least that is safe and secure. Everything is set up fairly simple, and with a few pushes of buttons on the screen, the small cube of hard-drives winds down, then falls completely silent and dark a few seconds later.

instead of going north from Branson & Partner Reception while (HP of Melanie is 4):
	say "     As you walk towards the door to the company offices, Melanie stands up from behind her desk and approaches with a smile on her face. 'Let me get that for you, [Sir].' She looks quite enticing in her secretary outfit, especially with the way she sways her hips with every step. Given the shape of her slender hooves, the young woman has no need for high heels - she just naturally walks with her chest and breasts pushed out in a way that would draw anyone's eye. While thoughts about this are still chasing each other in your head, the smiling doe reaches the frosted glass door in the back wall and pulls it open, inviting you to step right in. Beyond lies an office with six desks in a similar style as Melanie's, most of which are occupied right now by other women.";
	say "     The office girls look up at your sudden entrance, then glance to Melanie for explanation of what is going on. She responds with a little wave, indicating for them all to step up to meet 'Mr. Branson's new business partner'. The first one who does so gets introduced to you as Bella; an eye-catching tigress that steps forward on silent paws. The usual uniform of white skirt plus a darker skirt is lightly changed on her, with multiple buttons undone, revealing some glimpses of side-boob. Next up, a friendly Labrador girl steps into line and gets introduced as Elise. Seeing her makes it clear that Mr. Branson definitively picked his workers by their looks, as she also is fairly slender, but well-set in the breasts department. The young woman's tail beats in a steady rhythm as she looks at you with interest.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'And then there are Lola and Layla,' Melanie goes on to say and waves her hand a little to draw your attention away from Elise's looks. For a second, you think you're seeing double as you look at the two who step up, as it is literally the same woman twice over. Only when the snow-white bunny twins with their long, platinum blonde hair come to a stop next to their colleagues do the differences become apparent. While the first one (Lola) looks you straight in the eye and sets her hands on her hips in a confident stance, her sister Layla appears somewhat more demurely, hands held relaxed behind her back. All four of them - or five, including Melanie - stand at attention, looking at you with interest in their eyes.";

The smiles on their faces never go away, but you can't help but think that they seem a little bit less genuine as you get handsy. Eventually, your inspection tour is complete, by which time Melissa clears her throat and says, 'Okay everyone, let's get back to work. Mr. Branson is expecting those documents by tomorrow.'

They react with genuine smiles and friendly comments, seeming surprised at the everyday, business-like tone you're maintaining right now.

As you tell some stories and learn that neither of them had any family or close friends in the city (somehow all having been hired some distance away and moved here for their jobs), you notice Lola glancing at a white streak on one of the desks thoughtfully before she joins back in on the conversation.
