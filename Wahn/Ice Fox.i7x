The description of Snowy Forest Trail is "     You're on a narrow trail through the urban forest, in an area of fairly dense growth. Fragments of the buildings formerly occupying this part of the city are few and far between, with trees and other plants forming what seems to be a century-old forest. Interestingly, this part of the woods is a lot cooler than the rest of the city, with some snow covering low-hanging branches and the ground under your feet. Despite this, you don't actually feel uncomfortable, which might actually be a wholly positive result of the nanites. Towards the north, this effect only gets more pronounced - there are white flakes in the air there, falling at a placid pace to settle in a glistening blanket of undisturbed snow.".

Everything around you is covered in a blanket of freshly fallen snow that quietly crunches with every step you take and more white flakes are falling in a gentle but steady shower. Interestingly, they actually seem to originate all from the same spot - an opening in the side of the hill, high enough to walk into. From there, the snow gets blown out into the surrounding area, creating beautiful whirls and eddies in the air as it gets blown through the air.";

Frozen Cave Tunnel is a room. Frozen Cave Tunnel is northeast of Forest Cave Entrance.
The description of Frozen Cave Tunnel is "     You're in what seems like a natural cave tunnel, leading steadily downwards in a slow curve. Might actually be a spiral, now that you think of it - remembering the part you've already got behind you and what you can see ahead. And you can actually see, despite being underground and in a cave, thanks to the ever-present snow all around you. Each flake has a tiny and dim glow to it, making them whiter than white and creating a beautiful sparkling effect that covers the ground in a smooth layer and has settled into all of the cracks and rough surfaces of the cave walls. Seeing wondrous sights like this makes it hard to remember that you're still in the city sometimes, and that all of this didn't exist just a short while ago.".

On the smooth black stone floor (granite, if you'd have to guess), there are some pieces of furniture scattered about, tables and chairs, plus a number shelves - all of them white. Hard to say if that is their natural color or if it's just the thin layer of frost covering them. In the back, there is what can only be called a nest - a circular affair of many blankets on the ground, with countless big and small pillows piled in it. The walls enfolding the place seem fairly natural and cave-like, with sparkling snow having settled on every bump and unevenness, filling the place with a smooth and even light. Finally, the ceiling above you is quite a sight, as what seems to be a snow-storm whirls in the air there, centered on a palm-sized star of a snow flake, with more and more snow constantly being created as steamers of flakes are sent to blow up the tunnel up to the surface.";

The far side of it has a colossal mound of snow, almost reaching the rocky ceiling at its highest point. Numerous snow-white rabbits are hopping around in this enclosure, and also digging into the snow, creating tunnels and chambers within. The little animals look basically just like oval fluffs of fur when they sit down, only extending their surprisingly long legs when they move around. On the 'visitor' side of the cave, Russel has made a camp for himself in a little niche, with a sleeping bag rolled out as well as stacks of supplies that he needs to care for his charges.";

The far side of it has what seems to be a miniature cliff molded out of its back wall, with a comfy fox-sized cave dug into it and a sloping path to the top up one side. All of this is covered in a liberal scattering of snow. Numerous snow-white foxes are moving around in this enclosure, yipping and with some chasing each other up to the lookout spot and down again. Aubrey the foxtaur is in their midst, playing with the little vulpines by throwing several rubber balls for her charges to run after and bring back. She seems totally focused on playtime with the foxes, barely registering you other than a friendly smile and wave as you come in. On your side of the ice wall, there is a big nest of warm blankets in one corner of the irregularly shaped room. Looks like Aubrey and Barbara share it.";

She bears more scales on the backs of her forearms, as well as the shins of her legs, with them becoming more pronounced further down and ending at the sharp toe-claws that make her paws appear more like a dragon's than a foxes. Finally, there is a grand total of nine flexible fox tails fanned out behind her, swaying gently left and right. All of this is readily visible to you as she doesn't seem to need - or want - to wear clothes. Inevitably, your gaze wanders down between her thighs, where you spot a thin slit between two scale-plates.";
	say "     The dragon-fox is standing right underneath the big snowflake rotating close up to the ceiling, looking at it with her arms raised, sending pale wispy streamers of energy up to it. This seems to charge up the frosty star, making it spin even faster, with more snow forming in the surrounding air. It blows towards the cavern entrance in a strong gust - or in other terms... right at you! Surprised, you can't help but let out a strained gasp as you stand against the gale, barely keeping upright despite the blowing wind. The sound draws the attention of the ice fox, who stops what she was doing and turns her muzzle to look at you.

Still, just walking into a woman's bedroom unbidden. I think that demands an apology...'

It is well-sized at about ten inches in length and light pink, tapering a little along its length till it reaches a pointy tip. The base of it just outside her scaled slit holds a noticeable bulge - no doubt, this swells up to a full-sized knot when she is balls-deep inside her partner and cums. Experimentally, you stroke the smooth scales between her legs, finding them warm to the touch and flexible. Miyuki may be scaly in parts, but she is far from cold-blooded, that's for sure. Your searching fingers dip into her slit too, feeling warm skin inside that forms the root of her cock. 'Someone is eager to explore,' the fox tells you from above, smiling down at you. 'You might just find something else that is fun in there sometime - but right now, I really feel like getting sucked.'";

Miyuki gives a pleased yip as your tongue brushes over her dickhead for the first time, followed by your lips closing around it and gently suckling the hard shaft. You proceed to go down on her, steadily sliding more and more of the erection into your mouth while exploring its fleshy length with your tongue, feeling every little ridge and vein. Her tip is halfway down your throat by the time you reach the pre-knot bulge, bumping its with your lips. 'Nnnghh - you're good at this,' your foxy host tells you in a pleased tone, stroking your head while her dick throbs in your throat.";

The slick vulpine shaft slides easily into your mouth now, allowing you to bob up and down on it in a rapid pace. As you give the dragon-fox a blowjob that you hope she won't forget anytime soon, you can't help but chuckle around the dick in your mouth. It truly is amazing what situations the nanite apocalypse creates... here you are, blowing an anthro half-dragon half-fox sorceress in her icy den, bobbing on a nonhuman cock and now closing your fingers around her knot to squeeze and jerk it too. That last thing does make Miyuki go churr in pleasure, her paw-hands having to grip your shoulders tightly as she has to hold on.";
		say "     You can feel the bulge under your fingers expand moment by moment, a clear sign that she enjoys something tightly wrapped around her knot and is getting quite close - so you go all out in your blowjob, really sucking hard on her dick and squeeze her tightly. Just a few heartbeats later, you are rewarded with a heavy throb of her cock and cum splurging forth, spurting right down your throat and into your stomach. You can feel her dick pulse against your tongue, again and again, as it deposits a full load of ice fox cum into your body. Damn, where is all of that coming from?! She doesn't even have balls! But then... who cares - certainly not you, with the nice and warm filling she's just given you, sating what hunger you might have had with her rich load.";

While you concentrate on not losing out on any of her load, your gaze wanders up the slick shaft that was in your throat until a second ago, right to the thick knot under your grasping fingers. Fuck, that's a big one! If she ties that with someone, Miyuki is certainly gonna stay bound to them for a long while. You caress and squeeze the bulge of flesh while her orgasm slowly ebbs off, swallowing more than one mouthful of her tasty load before she is done.";

Miyuki's tongue explores your mouth, wrestling with your own and stealing a taste of her own load before she pulls back to smile broadly at you. 'Now THAT was an amazing apology. I think I got a new favorite to have their lips wrapped around my dick! You're forgiven, sweetie. And feel free to visit me again in the future. There is so much fun we can have... But for now, give me a little privacy to clean up, will you?'

With a creak of frost forming impossibly fast, you freeze in your movements and feel yourself get incredibly stiff - and not in a good way.

'Me too,' the canine replies dreamily, her tail wagging as she leans in against Miyuki and licks her muzzle in turn. 'I do worry a bit though - I mean, you told me that all of this,' the corgi says and indicates her stomach, 'is only two of them. Two eggs that you've put into me in a [italic type]very[roman type] memorable night. They're clearly not that... um, small. That means I'll have a hell of a time to push the little ones out. Can I - can we - have them here? I read it helps with the pain if you are able to hold the father's hand during the birthing, you know?'";
	say "     'Of course love,' Miyuki says in a very caring tone, caressing the corgi as she leads the young woman to the entrance and then making some introductions between yourself and the canine house-guest. After a little bit of casual discussion, Leandra says that she needs to go and get home, at which point the ice fox hands her a basket overstuffed with fish and other foodstuffs. That's one way to keep [']em fresh, you guess. Looks like the corgi and her growing offspring will be taken care of for some days with that load. Happy and quite heavily loaded with the basket, Leandra exchanges another kiss with Miyuki and leaves. After she vanishes, the ice fox sorceress waits for about a minute to make sure she is gone, then whirls around to face you, a quizzical expression on her face.";

	say "     'Now what in the world did she mean about being afraid of pain and all of that?! I didn't want to frighten her so I kept quiet when Leandra mentioned it. It's good that you happened in at just the right time. Can you shed light on this for me?' the sorceress asks in a quite determined manner. Somewhat puzzled that she doesn't know about this basic fact of life, you begin laying out the details, as far as you remember them. How a woman's water breaks, contractions set in, hours upon hours of those sometimes, then finally a new life being pushed out into the world. From her shocked reaction, you have to assume that Miyuki must be white as a sheet under her fur right now, gaping at you speechlessly. 'But, but - I... I barely have any words. This is so primitive. Like animals out in the wilderness. I can't believe that anyone would be made to suffer like that. The priestesses of the All-Mother would never let it happen!'";
	say "     Bidding her to slow down, you ask what exactly Miyuki means, so she tells you of the central nature goddess of her homeland, worshiped almost universally by all species and granting blessings to expectant mothers. You wisely postpone the question of why a goddess like that isn't revered on earth to another day (not wanting to get Miyuki started on tales of religious persecution), and instead ask her about the nature of those blessings. Apparently children, eggs, and the like are supposed to be delivered painlessly, and fairly instantly, in her experience. Still shaking her head about the fact that you never heard about her goddess, Miyuki adds, 'The prayer to beseech the goddess is common knowledge. Anyone in the faithful can recite it and be heard. I guess I know what I'll be doing with Leandra next time she comes by.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The next words that come from Miyuki's mouth are, 'Okay, where is the local sacred grove? I - oh, wait. You do not [italic type]have one[roman type].' Ending in a groan, she puts on a frown and tells you, 'The one thing I need is the juice of a Mother's Star. It's a fruit. Yay big, with five lobes. You know, symbolizing the ways that the All-Mother created for things to be born.' Raising her hand, she counts them off finger by finger: 'Spontaneous Generation, Budding, Division, Egg-Laying and Live Birth. Come on, there must be something like that here. They're green, then turn yellow when ripe.' That last detail makes you pause for a second, remembering a tropical fruit that fits the description fairly well - a carambola, otherwise known as a starfruit. You mention it to Miyuki, who gets a quite relieved expression, and says, 'I would be very thankful if you could bring me one or more of those then please. If you want, I could even bless you too.";

Looks like a kind of airlock system, meant to reduce heating costs by keeping the cold inside of the building. Sadly, with no power, this just means that the place can't even benefit from the breeze of wind that blows through the zoo from the coast, so what awaits you inside is stuffy, warm air. The hallway behind the doors has information sheets on one wall, pointing out all sorts of things about arctic animals, which is barely legible in the dim surroundings of the powerless building.

Cautiously looking around the corner, you see the behind the scenes parts of the zoo - a food preparation area and a large cage to separate animals from the rest if needed. In the former, you see the source of the noise; there's a large tigertaur there, hands clamped on the shoulder and neck of an arctic foxtaur as he ruts her from behind and pushes the whimpering woman down.

A male anthro rabbit is standing protectively next to the animals, holding on to one of the cage bars. Looks like he and his compatriot haven't been getting much sleep and are about ready to keel over, what with the need to keep watch on their animal friends all the time.
