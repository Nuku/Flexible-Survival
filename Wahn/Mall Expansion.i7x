	say "     As you walk through the food court into the atrium, passing through the moderately thick crowd of people in the main mall thoroughfare, you suddenly feel a pat on your upper arm - it's Korvin, your German shepherd attack dog, wanting to catch your attention. 'Hey boss,' he says to you in a conversationalist tone, though only giving a short glance to your face before he sets his gaze back on something apparently quite interesting for him. 'See that one? White fur, a bit short but nicely muscled? She's one ripe bitch. I can smell her heat from here...' Following his gaze, you see a female bull terrier strolling through the crowd somewhere ahead of you, her white fur typical of the dog breed.";
	say "     Indeed, the young woman is a bit on the short side, though she seems to make that up by being well-muscled. You can't see that much of her due to the distance and people in the way, but she seems like an attractive bitch, wearing a shiny silver chain collar and a number of piercings. Giving you a sidelong grin, Korvin adds, 'This is the best time to take on tough bitches like her. If they're in heat, a gal that'd have head-butted you in a second otherwise will be ready to spread her legs easy. Come on boss, let's go after her!'";
	say "     [bold type]Do you indulge Korvin's impulses and let him stalk the bull terrier bitch?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yeah, why not. Might be fun to see him try to talk his way into her pants...";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Nope! You tamed Korvin from being a wild dog, attacking people in the streets. He doesn't need the temptation.";
	if Player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Letting yourself get taken up in Korvin's eager hunt for the white-furred anthro, you start walking a little faster. Together, you prowl after the bull terrier, keeping her in sight. As the crowds thin out a little, you manage to catch some more glimpses of the rest of her. Small in stature but muscular, with a sleeveless blue t-shirt on her body. And... is she bottomless?! Ah no, the thin strap of a skimpy pair of underwear is visible just under her tail. Your quarry moves along with determined steps, turning right and into the east wing of the mall. There, she quickly reaches a door to a slender store that a sign above the door makes out as a real estate agent. You can see some sofas and comfortable furnishings in there - looks fairly nice.";
		say "     The white-furred female looks through the glass door and seems disappointed by something. Maybe she was expecting someone? Meanwhile, Korvin gives you a grin and with the words, 'I'll show you how this is done,' he sets out to stroll up to the bitch he sniffed out. Your attack dog struts forward confidently, raising a hand and opening his muzzle to chat her up - just as a deep voice calls out, 'Heya sis!' The bull terrier whirls around, showing you that she looks quite presentable from this side too - her attractively canine face drawn into a smile and two hand-sized bumps under her t-shirt. The person who called out to her is... enormous is almost too weak a word. Another bull terrier, this one male and about one and a half times her height is walking up to the young woman. The similarities between the two of them are fairly obvious - same powerful build, hair color, even the features if one allows for the fact that the big one is male...";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     It only takes a single look from Korvin at the hulkingly big dog to abort his mission, doing his best to act casually as he walks right past the bitch and keeps going, then circles back around to join you again while the two white dogs hug and start talk to one another. You're too far away to make out any words, given the typical noise level with the people in the mall - so you concentrate on taking in the big dog in a bit more detail. Quite tall, and muscular to match that, with a tight black muscle shirt showing off his chest exceedingly well. The only other article of clothing on him is a broad leather collar with some buckles on it. He actually is bottomless and clearly unconcerned about nakedness even in this crowd, allowing you a nice view of firm buttocks and a slim tail that wags happily.";
		say "     'Damn,' Korvin murmurs as he steps up next to you, staring daggers at the large dog's back. 'So close to find out that she's gonna be claimed by that mountain of a guy.' Looking at him with raised eyebrows, your attack dog laughs at the expression of surprise you're wearing. 'What, did you think that her being his sister would stop him? Told ya, she's ripe as fuck. Ah, and you didn't see him from the front, did ya?' Nodding down to his crotch, Korvin wraps a hand around the base of his sheath, out of which the tip of his canine shaft is poking. 'He was half hard when he walked up to the bitch, more than I am right now. I tell you, won't take long til... ah, there they go.' Following the pointing finger of Korvin, you see the canine woman leading her brother into the store, drawing him after her with one paw-hand holding his massively larger one. You can clearly see his raging hard-on before the large canine vanishes through the glass door.";
		say "     [bold type]Do you want to walk closer and watch?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;

			LineBreak;
			say "     Walking up to the store, you soon spot something through the still open door - a pair of black panties lying on the ground, barely a step inside the real estate agent's office. They certainly were eager to start! A lustful bark draws your attention deeper into the room so you walk in, catching sight of the dogs after a few steps. On the ground behind a large sofa, the big dog is on all on all fours - or three, actually as one large hand is holding his sister by the up as he humps is bright red cock into her pussy. The young woman's shirt has been pushed up over her breasts, showing off the well-rounded orbs with their pink nipples, complete with shiny silver nipple rings. 'Fuck me Boomer! Damn I like that prick of yours!' she barks out excitedly, writhing under him as he takes her deep.";
			say "     In reply, the muscular brute of a dog plants a hungry kiss on her muzzle, pushing his tongue between her lips to wrestle with hers as he keeps up the non-stop humping into the smaller female. It looks pretty awe-inspiring that she can take the thick rod between his legs - especially with the bulging knot at the base of it that he pops in and out of her again and again in little extra thrusts after sliding most of the way into her. Wow, he must be pretty deep in the grip of his bestial urges if his knot is already that big, almost ready to tie to her! Looks like she's not the only one being ridden by the imperatives of her heat.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The canine siblings rut like... well, wild dogs, right before you - not even registering that you and Korvin have come in and are watching. In a tense voice from by your side, your attack dog comments, 'Fuck it - if I'm not gonna breed her, at I wanna at least come watching those nice little breasts bounce!' With that said, he grasps his own canine shaft in a paw-hand and starts to jerk off, gaze focused on Boomer's sister as she gets fucked. The grunts and growls of the large white dog humping into his bitch quickly build louder and louder, until he hammers into her one last time, tying them together as his knot swells up fully and those heavy balls in his sack start pumping out a deluge of cum to fill her womb.";
			say "     'FFffuuuuckkk YEAH! Take it Jane!' Boomer shouts at the top of his voice, all the while still humping against her crotch, grinding his throbbing shaft even deeper. You can see the outline of that massive piece of equipment under her toned abs, pulsing with more and more cum being shot into her. Meanwhile, Korvin is frantically jerking his own doggy cock, catching up to the two of them in short notice. As his climax hits, the German shepherd stumbles a little, not quite as firm in his stance as he trembles in arousal - but you catch him and keep a hand on his shoulder. With barely suppressed grunts, he starts shooting off his own load a heartbeat, splattering the side of the sofa with his cum.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     For a few moments, quiet fills the real estate agent's office, only interrupted by the heavy breathing of three well-sated anthro dogs. The siblings on the ground start making out, intermixed with Boomer licking at Jane's breasts, thankfully still too occupied with one another to notice yourself and your companion. After a last glance to take in their forbidden coupling, you decide to keep things from becoming awkward and take Korvin by the arm to guide him outside. You pat your trusty attack dog on the shoulder, getting a pleased lick to your hand as he tells you that he likes being yours, then stroke the warm fur on Korvin's neck and head before telling him to get going with you. Walking back to the mall atrium, you get back to what you had originally planned to do.";

Especially at night, the shining beacon of an illuminated building draws survivors from far and wide - as well as ferals of course, but that's what mall security is for. The food court is being used by many to hang out and get a bite to eat, be it some of the food stores of the mall itself or stuff brought in from outside. You see all sorts of stuff being handled or chewed on - from head-sized cherries and strips of roasted mystery meat to regular fries and cooked rice.";
	say "     As you walk past some of the counters of all sorts of fast food franchises under new ratty management, you overhear an argument starting. 'What? But you have a whole lot more food and gave him something for free!' a burly anthro bison scoffs at the mall-rat in one of the stores. The rodent male steps back a little and raises his hands in a consoling gesture, but still goes on to say, 'I'm sorry dude, but we only got so much, you know, and there isn't too much new stuff coming in these days. The stores are for residents only... but hey, you can always trade something. Fast food for every single damn meal does get boring quickly, so lots of people will switch with you if you got fruit, or some of the otherworldly and alien things that have appeared out there. If you find some of those purple bananas for example, you'll make lots of friends here.'";

Lost my pack to a bunch of creeps downtown, so... I don't have anything to trade,' he murmurs mostly to himself, then looks up at the food clerk again, getting an apologetic shake of the head. Then suddenly, a slender mall-rat in skinny jeans with a black hoodie that had been waiting in line steps up and says, 'Sure you got something. You can have the hot-dogs I was gonna order for some of that fresh bison milk.' Turning around fully, the bison looks at the rat that spoke with a puzzled expression. 'Err... I'm a man, you know...' With a chuckle, the rodent pushes his hood off, revealing a broadly smiling face framed in platinum blond hair. 'I'm counting on it,' he goes on to say and reaches out to rub the larger man's crotch. 'Oh. Ooh!' the bison replies, looking at the slender young man with a surprised expression and accepting being touched.";

You unobtrusively follow the two of them to the entrance of a very plain service hallway between two stores and hang around to observe what happens next. Stopping a few steps into the passage, the rat looks up at the burly man and smiles, then holds out his slender paw with the words, 'So then. I'm Byron, by the way.' Visibly swallowing, the bison shakes hands with him and replies, 'Amir. I - um... do you do this often?' Byron chuckles as he says, 'What? Proposition strangers? Only the hot ones. Let me guess - never been with a guy?' As the bison shakes his head, he adds, 'You're in for a treat.'";
		say "     With that said, Byron crouches down and undoes the button of Amir's pants, then pulls the zipper all the way down. He pulls the nervous man's pants down, baring his naked crotch, showing a respectably sized soft cock. 'Going commando, eh? Nice!' the rat cheers, to which his new acquaintance replies, 'Wearing two layers of clothes with this fur gets too hoo-hot!' He momentarily stutters as Byron cups his weighty balls, giving them an appreciative squeeze. Then the adventurous rat slides his fingers around Amir's manhood and starts to stroke it, coaxing the broad-shouldered man to full hardness quickly. A second later, he licks the bison's erection, causing him to gasp out, 'Fuck. That feels nice!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Byron goes down on his new friend with eager attention, taking the big man's dick-head into his mouth and sucking on it before quickly moving on to bobbing up and down on Amir's shaft. The bison starts to breathe heavily as he is pleasured by the young adult rodent, at first clenching his eyes shut and possibly imagining a woman kneeling in front of him, then eventually peeking down at the blond head of hair of Byron's. There is still a moment of hesitation after that, but after a few more seconds, Amir grunts, 'Damn! Suck that dick dude!' Byron pulls off his erection with a wet slurp, looking up at the bull and grinning broadly, then giving his glistening dick-head a feather-light kiss.";
		say "     'Told ya you'd like it,' the mall rat says teasingly, sticking out his tongue to trace it around Amir's mushroom head. He keeps this up several minutes long, slowly pushing the bison to higher and higher arousal, until the man finally can't control himself anymore. 'Nnghh! I need more!' Amir groans in lust, putting his hands on the crouching rodent's head and pushing him down on his cock, now face-fucking Byron on his own accord. In his lust, the horny bison doesn't hold back at all, humping against his partner's face and making his heavy balls smack the anthro rat's chin again and again. It doesn't take too much of this frantic thrusting before he lets out a loud bellow and his cock starts to throb with rich bison cream that shoots directly into Byron's stomach.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The cock-sucking rodent has to pat his standing partner's leg several times before he manages to gain Amir's attention and the big man lets go of his head with a somewhat embarrassed air. Byron doesn't pull off the still throbbing bison cock though - seems he just wanted to slide it out a little so he actually gets to taste some of the cum. You observe the pulsing of Amir's thick shaft, now that it is partway outside of the mall rat's mouth, knowing that each time a heavy throb of cum spurted out. Byron visibly swallows several times before the bison's orgasm ebbs off, so he really did trade his meal for a full stomach of bison nut-milk. Eventually, he pulls off the shaft fully and stands up, sticking out his tongue to show Amir the white of his own cum before swallowing this last bit demonstratively.";
		say "     'That was great. I mean... just wow!' the bison bull gasps out, breathing heavily. 'Can't complain myself, big guy. I think I got a new favorite flavor for my milk,' Byron replies amicably and leans forward to give Amir's balls a last fondle before the bison reaches down and pulls his pants back into place, then zips up. 'Come on, let's get you a bite to eat. Gotta keep up your energy.' With that said, the mall rat takes his bison friend by the hand and leads him back out into the open food court, grinning at you as they pass and wiggling his eyebrows meaningfully.
