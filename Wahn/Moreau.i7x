	say "     Moreau is a snake... quite literally so, as most of his body is purely ophidian, going on and on as it slowly tapers. But in addition to that, he does have a waist too - you can see the typical little bulges where the hip-bone are right under the skin, and above that a human-like torso, giving him arms and opposable thumbs. A quick glance down to his crotch reveals that it is smooth and relatively bare, with just a narrow slit between the rows of scales - no telling what might or might not be hidden inside that. The naga bears a truly awe-inspiring set of scales, with vibrant shades of red, orange and yellow making him almost appear like a dragon, complete with a little crest of scale-tips standing up on his broad snake-head. ";
	say "     In a sharp contrast to his fiery-colored body, the storekeeper's large eyes are startlingly green, making you freeze where you stand as he notices your attention and focuses his gaze on you in turn. The emerald, slit-pupiled orbs seem like bottomless pools you could stare at forever and lose yourself in... and you almost do, before he turns his head and breaks the stare. Opening his mouth a fraction, the naga tastes the air with his split tongue and then smiles at you, waving you closer with an inviting gesture.";

		else:
			say "     As you approach the naga and offer sex, Moreau raises the scaled ridges above his eyes and gives you an unimpressed look. 'Do you usually offer yourself to people you only recently met? No thank you, I for one am not on par with the wild beasts roaming the streets.' That said, he makes a cutting gesture in the air with his hand, signifying that the topic is over. Maybe you should try talking to him about what interests him and getting to know Moreau first...";
	else if Affection of Moreau >= 2:
		say "     As you approach the naga and offer sex, Moreau raises the scaled ridges above his eyes and a slight smile crosses his face. He lets his gaze roam over your body while his forked tongue flicks out and tastes the air between you. 'While you're certainly a very becoming person,' he says with a smile at you, half-raising a hand to reach out, then pulling it back. 'Right now isn't a good time I'm afraid. I do have the store open, and customers are coming in. It'd be... unprofessional.' With an apologetic sway of his head, the naga slithers to the side a little at this point, actually calling out to welcome someone wandering in through the door, which does prove his point.";


Instead of conversing the Moreau:
	project the figure of Moreau_face_icon;
	if PlayerMet of Moreau is false:
		say "     'Welcome to my store,' the large snake hybrid pushes his lower body up to give you a gracious bow with his humanoid upper body. Then he snakes his way closer before coiling up right in front of where you stand, giving an inviting wave of his arm to indicate the mannequins lined up at the front of the store. 'Did something in the shop windows catch your eye? The offered wares are subject to change, and I do circle through the newer parts for people to have a look at.' You look around at the collection of mannequins, then ask what he actually sells. 'Why, bodies of course. Everything about them. The signage and name of the store are quite clear, are they not? Come, let me show you.' Miming you to walk over to the next bunch of mannequins, the ophidian storekeeper keeps up with your steps in a smooth glide of his scales on the tiled floor, stopping before the display models.";
		say "     'The world is in flux, down to literally the body you have - but many, oh so very many of people are dissatisfied with their adopted shapes. Maybe they were forced to shift, or couldn't help but succumb into it, and now they feel like they deserve... better. I offer this service, for a price.' Smiling at you, he then turns to stare directly at a mannequin displaying some characteristics of anthro gryphon. It appears somewhat eerie, as if one had switched body parts to make a hybrid creature, part alive and part plastic. While the showpiece's head is that of an almost featureless doll, with a plastic-y sheen and not even a mouth and nostrils, the rest of it is a perfect depiction a real anthro gryphon, its body detailing everything exactly, from the tips of the clawed digitigrade feet, up over a hermaphrodite's set of cock, balls and even the slit of a moist pussy. The pair of wings behind its back have individual feathers. It does not move, not even a little, or breathe.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Giving you a sidelong glance that tells you he loves showing off, Moreau crooks his finger a little at the mannequin - and the human-sized doll instantly reacts, walking over to come stand before you with startling suddenness. As it comes to stand in front of you in an 'at rest' position, you can't help but gulp and glance around. Ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-six, -seven, -eight... there are about thirty of those things in here, which makes you feel less like on a shopping trip and more like standing in the midst of a pride of lions. 'Do not be concerned, my assistants are perfectly well behaved. Watch this one for example,' Moreau says, amusement underlying his voice as he puts the gryphon doll through its paces, spinning around slowly, stretching and showing off the details of its shape.";
		say "     Once he is satisfied with the mannequin, Moreau sends it back to the original position and turns back to you. 'I can offer the service of giving people what they want. And even more than that - I give a warranty. No more losing what you so dearly desired, you understand,' the snake tells you in a quite smooth-talking voice, guiding you in a tour through the store, past numerous of the motionless living dolls. While you walk, your gaze falls upon a treasure-trove of supplies stacked up in the back. He must have weeks forth of food and water there! Curiosity drives you to check it out from up close, but after a few steps, the naga's hand slides under your arm and gently but firmly tugs you back to his tour. Then you notice that every last one of the mannequins in the whole store turned their head towards you when you came close to the supplies. They quickly take their positions again, but you can't help but shiver a little from so many featureless faces staring at you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Finally arriving back where you started after having shown off all sorts of creature parts you never even knew existed, Moreau smiles and shows his forked tongue for a second. 'As you can see, I do have much to offer. It depends a bit on what people sell to me, so be sure to get anything you desire immediately, so it is not sold out by the time you return. You will find the prices very reasonable for this unique service...'";

They are quite interesting, are they not? When this all started, seeing all the changes happening around this city had started to give me some vague ideas along the lines of this shop, but it wasn't until I stumbled on a discarded mannequin on the side of the road that those ideas really clicked together. And so I came here, where I knew there might be those who would be interested in body changing services. With a bit of my own [italic type]special[roman type] talent I was able to gather the mannequins you see here and have them serve my purposes. The process took some refining, but I think the result has been well worth it all.'";

You nod to him, gesturing for him to continue talking.";

I fought and defeated it, and nearly left it there, until the idea of this shop occurred to me. I do have certain... powers of persuasion, which I used to bring the mannequin under my control. Having seen what they do to those they defeat, I saw it as a public service to collect a number and take them out of roaming the streets. After the first two or three, it became easier, with the previous ones to hold down the next. So yes, my mannequins are from out in the city.

Couldn't help wonder why, given that nagas aren't exactly... common, hereabouts.' Raising an eyebrow as he looks at you, he then gives a little wave with the tip of his tail towards the other side of the mall wing outside. 'A helpful mallrat eventually clued me in, apparently there's a [']classic['] cartoon that contains a giant snake with hypnotic powers. He even showed me the scene, over in the CubeBuster store.

From the corner of your eye, you can see the tip of his tail stop its normal slow movement, being held still and stiff. You raise your hands defensively, telling him to calm down, then add that you simply wanted to talk about the topic with him. The snake hybrid's eyes widen slightly and the hint of a smile flickers over his mouth, followed by a nod to you. 'Ah, okay - my apologies. I guess I've just become a bit sensitive about the matter. Anyways, there's various ways of hypnotic influence...' With that, he starts a nice little discussion with you about what can be done, and what not.

His forked tongue flicks out and there is a slight hissing sound, which you realize a second later as a chuckle. Gracefully shrugging his slender shoulders, the naga creates a sweeping motion as if to clear the air, then continues to say, 'Amateurs on the other hand will leave... inconsistencies, open ends to their influence. The mind is a complex thing, and will start to chafe against those inconsistencies, getting irritated. An affected person will know [italic type]something[roman type] is off, without necessarily being able to put their finger on what exactly it is.

He motivates you to wear it before other things, demands you collect any strip of his favorite chewing gum you might come across, all the way to instilling the need to be freshly douched and carrying a bottle of lube (to be 'ready for him').

Unless I call you 'Sweetcheeks', then you'll straight away fall back into this trance and be ready for more commands. You understand?'

Windows, the till and everything is fully intact though. Looks like it's not the place anyone would even think of looting, in the midst of the nanite apocalypse. Making a beeline for the 'Staff Only' door in the back of the shop, you guide Moreau/Anton's hand to push it open, then to shepherd you into the florist's working space.

This is fine and okay. Do not be worried.' Nodding acceptingly, as he knows best, your focus moves more to what currently lies before you. There is only a thin slit between the smooth scales of the naga that indicates the presence of genitals, although on second glance... it isn't quite as thin and invisible between his scales as usual, when he's in the store. Given that Moreau doesn't wear clothing at all, your gaze must have slipped over the section of his body more than a few times just today, yet it never looked like this.

Despite being a little flustered by being fingered, he lets you proceed to penetrate him, not wanting to take you away from the memory any further than he already has. After a moment, the naga actually appears to start to like the sensation, almost seeming a little surprised about that. Pushing your fingertip further, you encounter something firm, yet yielding. As you rub it, you hear a pleased grunt from Moreau/Anton. Adding a second finger, you feel around, getting a good sense of his pointy dickhead and feeling the differences to a human's, like for example a ridged rim on it. Your touch obviously arouses him, as it doesn't take long before you can see the tip start pushing apart the opening of Moreau's genital slit.";

By the time he's showing about nine inches of cock with the thickness of a well-grown zucchini, you think he's done getting harder, until suddenly, the genital-slit stretches wide to allow for a bulge to squeeze past with a sudden slurp. Moreau's got something akin to a canine knot at the base of his shaft, which is now revealed to be a full twelve inches! Knowing what is expected of you, the next thing to do is sliding your lips over the head of Moreau/Anton's erection, taking it into your mouth. ";

Moreau's juices have an interesting, almost spicy flavor to them, and you find yourself enjoying going down on him. Remembering to assist Moreau/Anton in the same movements as before, you blindly grope to bring his hand up to your head, only to find that he's actually already reaching for you. A second later, the long, smooth-scaled fingers of the naga begin cradling the back of your head, gently but firmly pushing you towards his crotch. Relaxing your throat, you allow his length to slide deeper, and deeper, feeling the ridges of his nonhuman cock pass your lips. Before much longer, you've got most of his hard length inside you. Vaguely recalling nuzzling into soft feathers with your nose, you try to take the rest, but the knot prevents you from doing so, being too large to easily pass your lips.";

You're good at this!' Then you reach up with one arm, sliding your hand over Moreau/Anton's and slam your head down onto his cock, ramming the shaft as far as it will go in one swift move. You can't help but gag and choke a little at the sudden penetration that you inflicted on yourself in remembrance of Anton's behavior, yet thankfully manage to calm yourself and relax enough to continue taking the long cock down your throat. Not that Moreau/Anton would have let you get away, as you continue to push his hand against your head.";

After the first one or two times, you don't even have to guide Moreau/Anton to do it either, with the naga fucking in and out of your mouth on his own accord. You can't help but feel that he's leaking more pre than before, as the spicy taste just becomes more intense on your tongue. Is he getting close? You can't quite tell, but either way, this is the moment in which you grab Moreau/Anton by the wrist and pull his hand away from the back of your head, more towards the side now. Placing his fingers on your jaw, you pull back off his erection with an audible pop, then guide him to lift your head so he can look you in the eyes.

Trying to re-create the sensation from before, you reach back to grasp his shaft, lightly tugging on it to indicate he should be ramming it in right away, but in this point, the naga does not follow the guidance. Instead, one of his fingers slides into you almost gently, going in and out as it works more lube into your hole. Soon, it is joined by another, with the two digits moving apart to stretch your opening in preparation. You can sense that even though he is looking out for you, the whole process of going through this memory recall has wound up the naga more than a little bit, as he proceeds to withdraw his fingers before much longer. Then something different, thicker and pointily shaped, brushes against your back door, pressing in against it.";

Somehow, despite living through sensations of being helplessly in the grasp of this man-like creature, you never feel uncomfortable in the slightest way, with his warmth instead being quite nice instead. A tingling feeling against your neck tells you that Moreau's flicking tongue is now literally tasting your skin, no longer just the air. Then a ripple of pleasure dances up and down your spine as the first of the small ridges on his shaft pops past your pucker, rubbing your inner walls as the next follows a second later, and the next after that. While penetrating you inch by inch in a slow, inescapable fashion, Moreau is silent except for aroused hisses, until the bulge of his knot finally comes to rest against your skin, and the naga stops pushing.";

You can feel that the respectable girth of his shaft increases in the very last inch, right before the bulge, giving your muscular ring the sensation of being [italic type]very[roman type] well-stretched, with a little sting that doesn't hurt too much.

You remember being roughly fucked, but this is something else entirely, the thick cock and even thicker knot making you whimper a little. Moreau is a bit perplexed for a second, finding himself balls-deep inside your ass, with your hole reflexively pulling tight around his invading member. A pleasure-filled pant comes from his throat, with the naga smiling at you - only to look shocked as he then registers the pain so obviously drawn on your face.

He seems relieved as your expression smooths out immediately, with the pain in your rear fading away like a false memory. Instead, you now feel quite pleasant, and aroused by the hard cock pressing right against your prostate.
