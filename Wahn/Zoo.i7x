to say ZooEntranceDesc:
	say "     This area is the grand entrance to the zoo, with wrought iron gates and a fence surrounding the zoo grounds. A number of booths stand ready to accommodate large groups of visitors, although they're of course empty now. A large sign that looks as if it was just put up a short while ago says 'free admission'. You know from experience that the tall fence extends all the way around the whole zoo, so it's very likely that most of the animals (and transformed visitors) are still inside. The zoo's gift shop is west of your position, to the southwest lies a parking area and in the south, you can go back out into the city along the road leading here.";

Behind the bushes, in the west, you see the metal border fence, tall and made of wrought iron with spikes on the top. To the north, a tall wall looms up some small distance away.

to say BorderWallDesc:
	say "     The outer boundary of the zoo in the north is formed by a huge wall that extends far in both directions, cutting the city off from what lies beyond. You vaguely remember reading about its construction at the start of the last century - apparently a fair bit of the countryside towards the north was owned by a single rich man then, who was mad as a hatter with germophobia and whatnot. At some point the guy decided he never wanted to see another human in his life, resulting in the construction of the 'Great Wall of the West'. It doesn't even have any openings, just arches around an area a dozen miles in circumference which borders the ocean. No one has been on the other side of since then, as the land is held by a trust and has been declared a nature sanctuary. Which means that it would actually make it a good place to flee to, escaping the creature-infested inner city.";

From the looks of it, there are none out and about right now, though that might change at any moment. After all, there is a large cat flap in the side of the building forming the front of the enclosure. One of the panes of glass meant for dividing animals from visitors has been shattered into pieces, so you can just walk though the hole and exit the habitat and cheetah house through the doors in its south wall.[CheetahLickChance]";

You stand motionless as it walks up, inspecting you with interested eyes and sniffing at your legs, then even rearing up and placing its paws on your body to check your upper half out. Remembering from TV that the best thing to do in this situation is to remain still, you hope that it'll leave you alone, but the cat clearly has other plans.";
		say "     The cheetah nuzzles up to you, running a rough tongue over your exposed skin and pawing at your clothes to expose more - especially around your crotch. Getting lapped and played with by the wild beast, you relax a little after a while, as this seems to be about as far as it intends to go with you right now. Eventually, the big cat seems satisfied and leaves you alone, stalking away to a good spot and taking a nap there.";

Looks like someone went on a rampage in here... the stall doors of all the toilets have been ripped off, and it seems like something used toilet-paper rolls as chew toys, spreading shredded paper all throughout the rooms. Some large muddy paw-prints at the entrance show that it must have been an animal of some kind.";

the scent of Zoo Restrooms is "The air in the restrooms is thick with the musky scent of animal arousal and cum, with a light underlying note of urine. The heavy scents must be laden with pheromones or something, as you feel the urge to find a beastly lover rise in you.".

Surrounding a bronze statue of a tiger in the middle, there are benches, several picnic tables and a number of food stands - thoroughly looted now, and one even has been completely flattened. Even those stands that sold non-edible goods were ransacked, the shreds of white fluff scattered about them attesting to the gruesome end of quite a few stuffed toys. Seeing this scene of devastation reminds you strongly that this isn't a safe and peaceful place anymore. Clearly, there are wild beasts out and roaming the area and you should take care if you want to explore any of the many paths leading off in all directions, leading to the expansive grounds of the zoo. It might just be a good idea to go back west towards to the entrance.";
