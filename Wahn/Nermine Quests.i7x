Unfortunately they notice you almost immediately and a cry goes up as a number of them turn your way. Apparently your appearance has helped simplify the argument as they are eager to get another person to breed, and around eight or so of the dangerous fiery beasts immediately head your way. Staring at the large number of creatures arrayed against you, you do the only sensible thing in this situation and run. There really isn't anything you can do for their current captive, even if you tried...";
	say "     The beasts are hot on your heels as you dart through alleyways and down the mostly deserted streets of the city. You just can't seem to shake your pursuers however, and as you run from them in a reckless sprint, you find that the chase is attracting a good deal of additional from other infected in the city. Glancing back, you are shocked to see that there are now a group of gryphons squabbling with a wyvern above, the only reason one of them hasn't swooped down yet being their disagreement of who gets to do it. Then a pair of harpies joins the throng, further heating up the shouting and screeching match. Man, you really built a train of predators eager to snatch you! And worse yet, the dragators are gaining ground on you too!";

Taking a chance, you make a hard turn into the alley and see a half-open door only twenty or so feet ahead. Putting on one last burst of speed, you waste no time in diving through it, slamming the wooden door shut behind you. Panting loudly, brace against the door from the inside - partially to hold it shut, partially so you don't collapse in exhaustion, not really registering what is around you. Indeed, you close your eyes to listen, dreading sounds of clawed paws thundering down the alley, followed by splintering wood. But... they don't actually materialize. All is silent on the other side of the door. Could it be that you have shaken your pursuers?";

The place is only partially lit, with a number of thick candles bathing the room in a soft glow. All around you, there are high shelves stuffed with all sorts of wondrous items, many of them looking ancient - from books to various masks, statues, and mystic paraphernalia. The person who spoke to you is a woman, an anthro jackaless from the looks of her, standing right in front of you and looking you up and down with interest. 'Welcome to Nermine's store. The friendly jackaless eagerly greets her prospective customer.'";

She raises one eyebrow in wonderment and gently pulls you away from the door while saying, 'Now why would the concerned guest think that? Nermine can assure her visitor that there is little to fear in her storage room. Certainly nothing that would break out.' And with that, she twists the ornate door-handle, opening the wooden door into what clearly is a mid-sized storage room, overstuffed with more strange items. She smirks mysteriously as she walks in on slender paws, then pulls a small wooden box out of one of the shelves, carrying it with her as she walks back out into the store and closes the door once more.";

As the door falls shut behind you with the sound of a several little bells ringing, you are surprised that you actually are standing in the Smith Haven Mall, of all places. You've been here before, but... this strange store isn't something you remember about the place. Oh well, whatever brought you into it surely saved your bacon. Maybe it's worth to check it out and talk a bit more to Nermine...";

The jackaless is standing before you, illuminated by the glow of several nearby candles. 'Nermine welcomes her guest back into her store. The need must have been great, if the back door was taken...' At her nod to the door you are still bracing against, you remember the trail of creatures that were following you and warn Nermine about them possibly breaking through it - but she just pulls you away from the door with a gentle paw-hand. 'Now why would the concerned visitor think that? Nermine can assure her friend that there is little to fear in her storage room. Certainly nothing that would break out.'";

Opening what she is carrying and revealing leaves inside, the jackaless asks, 'Should Nermine make two cups of tea? It might provide some relaxation for overstressed nerves.' Once more baffled by the strangeness that is her and her store, you accept, drinking a cup of admittedly excellent tea with the storekeeper before you eventually step out into the mall.";

The landscape seems to grow increasingly disturbing as you travel, until eventually the path ahead is blocked by a thin curtain of vines sporting strange flowers. Looking through the hanging vines you can see what appears to be a quiet glade with a strangely warped tree in the center, a number of strange small vine-covered bushes scattered in the area around it. Looking closely at the tree you can see several large flesh-colored fruits hanging from its branches, and you notice a strong enticing smell hanging in the air, drawing you forward.";

The vines forming the boundary back there are being pushed aside as one of the golden-furred felinoids roaming the area slowly stalks into open, his head held high as he sniffs the air, obviously as entranced by the teasing scent as you were. You freeze as you watch the beast slowly cross the glade, your hand poised to draw the vines aside as he approaches the tree. And then the deception is revealed - as all of the plants seem to explode into motion around the startled feline, the vines and tendrils lying across the ground suddenly slithering and reaching out to trap and entwine the feral beast! The felinoid roars as he rips the vines apart even as they try to twist around and cocoon him, trying to push more flowers with their entrancing scent into his face and sink cock-like fruit into any opening they can find.";

But then of course... you also realize the felinoid has just provided you with a perfect distraction. All of the greenery is busy with him, giving you the best chance you'll ever get to snatch up some of the fruit Nermine desires! Before you can stop to think, you dart through the curtain of hanging vines, which try to cling to and rip at you as you push through them, almost as if sensing your purpose. Quickly charging across the glade at a run, you pull the basked from where you had it strapped to your back, your eyes on the fruit hanging temptingly from the tree. The large plant sways its branches as you near it, its leaves rustling in alarm, followed by what seems to be a commanding creak and crack of the wood.";

Glancing their way, you feel cautiously confident that you can make the snatch and grab before they intercept you - and you would have... if the tree hadn't forced a snare-like root through the surface at that moment. Catching your ankle, it tips you up and causes you to sprawl painfully across the ground just a little bit away from your goal.

Soon, they will immobilize the cat and those plants that are just 'helping' their brethren will no doubt turn your way.

Unintentional or not, it helped you greatly in your task, so you dash towards the writhing cocoon of vines. Kicking, wrenching and tearing a few of the main trunks where they sprout from the ground, you leave the green menaces injured - gushing clear sap that should have gone to strengthen their vines.

Then again, something nudges against you softly, and you turn your attention down to see what appears to be some kind of strange cat-like creature made up entirely of vines and tendrils, small flowers staring up at you where eyes would normally be. For some reason the vine-creature seems vaguely familiar to you, as you stretch out several of your own vines to pet its head, your tendril-like fingers tangling with the vines of its body and sending a soft surge of pleasure through you both. Looking at yourself you realize you are completely made of vines as well, though in a slightly more humanoid shape.";

The feline nudges you again, and you turn your attention back to what your fellow plant wants. Tangling your vines with the feline's again, you realize that it is time for you both to move to a new area, this one already growing overcrowded with your other growing brethren. With some effort you manage to uproot yourself, feeling unsteady as you spread your roots out to get a better purchase on the top of the ground, glancing at your new companion you realize they might have a better idea of how to do things, as with more vine-stalks on the ground it would be much easier to balance.

The city is dangerous for a plant that isn't securely rooted, although most of the animals stay out of your way, the two of you end up fighting several times. While you are unable to trap and root your opponents properly, you still manage to drive them off together. Eventually you find a somewhat nicer area near a river, and the two of you walk into the flowing water, allowing it to carry you along for a while, replenishing your strength as you float by.";

You realize vaguely as you twine your roots together with that of your vaguely feline companion, that your success was likely due to the fact that there were two of you working together, your nearly simultaneous viney awakening allowing you to succeed where likely many others have failed. You aren't sure how much time passes as the two of you grow and bask in the sunlight together, your vines growing larger and more powerful, even as they intertwine with those of your companion, but eventually you both sense something nearby.";

Eventually more of the animals show up, in ones and twos as if looking for something, and your glade grows quickly as you and your companion take turns showing them the pleasures of being anchored to the soil as well. Before long your first converts are eagerly helping you convert others as well, and as you bask in the sun and rub your vines through those of your once feline companion, you realize you truly have found a wonderful place for your new glade...";
