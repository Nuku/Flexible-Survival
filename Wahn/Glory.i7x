The typical thick crowd of people is milling around inside, with countless species and hybrids in appearance, busy eating or just hanging out together. Letting your gaze sweep over the crowd, your attention is soon drawn to a somewhat bedraggled-looking human-horsewoman hybrid just outside the glass entry doors to the mall. From what you can see at a distance, she has fully equine legs, hooves and a tail, while her upper body is still overwhelmingly human. She is talking to [if LoganCommand > 0]Logan, the bad apple of a wolverine guard banished outside to guard the exterior approaches[else]a wolverine guard[end if]. He quickly waves her through, but as she pulls the door open for herself, the guy steps up and slaps her ass with a lecherous grin on his face.";
		say "     The slap has quite an effect on the young woman, as she yelps in shock and bolts away from him, running forwards into the building. She dashes through the gaps between people, brushing right past you in her haste, until her path makes her collide headlong with the back of a tall man, bringing her to a full stop. The towering guy she ran into (a Clydesdale stud horseman, dressed in nothing more than a pair of somewhat threadbare jeans) turns around and grumbles in annoyance, which provokes an extreme reaction from the frightened woman. She screams and backs away from him, stumbling as she does so and falling to the ground. The horseman gives a puzzled look to the distraught hybrid woman, then shrugs and continues on his way. This leaves the young woman behind all alone, huddled up on the floor and sobbing.";

Seems like it isn't as empty as you thought. Looking closer, you see that a door reading 'Employees Only' (most likely a storeroom of some sort) is a crack open, with someone watching you through the gap. You manage to recognize the part-equine refugee that you saw arrive at the mall a little while ago in the few seconds before she quickly closes the door to hide herself away.";

And it works - after just a little wait, the door is pulled open a crack and she looks at you, then replies, 'I recognize you I think. Didn't you try to talk to me before? I - I guess you really meant it.' Slowly, as if forcing herself to do it, the young woman then pulls the door open and steps back, allowing you to join her in the small storeroom beyond. It contains an improvised camp made from clothing items piled on top of each other and a number of empty junk food wrappers. The young woman having found a refuge in the dark little room looks quite stressed out, with the tracks of dried tears visible on her somewhat grimy face.";
			say "     Stepping up and introducing yourself, you ask if she is alright. A sob escapes the young woman's lips and tears start welling up in her eyes again, accompanying the words, 'No, I'm not! This all is such a nightmare! I just want it to end!' With carefully chosen words, you manage to pull her back from starting a full-on crying spell, then finally ask in a gentle tone for her to tell you what happened. Taking a minute to collect her thoughts, the part-equine woman eventually starts to explain, 'Sorry. It's just... running into that horseman when I came here brought it all back to the forefront of my mind. What happened. With... with my brother. His name is - or maybe was, I really don't know anymore - Isaac. And I'm Glory. He had given me a weekend of riding at the 'Stables Hotel' for my birthday, with a really nice room and all. Drove me there himself when we both had the time and he wanted to stay to keep me company, so he got the room next to mine, with a connecting door.'";

A second later, he was thrusting away inside me, and yet somehow I didn't mind! I just felt my body react to him, and even... enjoyed it in that moment! Even though he wasn't even human, but something half horse - and worse, I recognized Isaac in that stallion humping away at me and I still didn't care! The sex continued till we both had come a bunch of times and were really exhausted, then dozed off. But when I came back to, everything that had happened came into focus and I realized what he - what we - had done!' Stomping the floor with one hoof, she looks down at herself, frowning at the hybrid body she now has.";
			say "     'I'm sure we'll both go to hell for it. And my shame is obvious for everyone to see too! While that beast was still asleep, I fled out into the city. I didn't want to talk to him, because what fucked me that day wasn't my brother anymore. It can't have been!' Glory's despair audibly built back up during the last few sentences, and she is sobbing openly as she continues, 'Everything since has just been further horror! The things that go on out there! I eventually heard that the mall was supposed to be safe, but with that guy at the entrance there and horsemen on the inside, I've got my doubts about that too!' Tears start running down Glory's cheeks as she sobs out, 'I don't think I can deal with this much longer - the constant danger and running from monsters in the streets, then even my own body betraying me to become a constant reminder of my sin! I just want it to end! Can't the police or someone - anyone - just protect us?'";

It doesn't work, with the door staying shut and no reply coming from the other side. You eventually try the doorknob, but something seems to be blocking the door from the other side. Nothing more to do here right now, you eventually shrug and walk out of the store, leaving the frightened refugee behind.";

Your guess is that she has taken a step or two back from the ledge and now isn't in the immediate danger of cracking under the pressure that living in this fallen city brings with it. She still does have a severe aversion to the equine parts of her body and is horrified by what happened between herself and her brother though. Only time will tell if she'll be able to cope with all that in the long term.

The young woman thanks you for the attempt at cheering her up and then shoos you out of her dark little room, closing the door quickly after you have left.

Santa Claws awaits the two of you on his large throne and he gives a friendly 'Ho ho ho' as he waves the two of you closer. Introducing Glory to him and explaining that she needs a place to stay where she can feel safe and protected once more, you earn a knowing nod from Santa, who smiles and then stands up to give his visitor a welcoming hug, saying that she can stay as long as she wants.";

At the same time, those who have been hit as hard as her rarely want to leave the Christmas Village again, instead preferring to stay as new elves in my domain.

It doesn't take all that long to reach the Body Shop, where Glory stares with wide open eyes at the many shapes of the motionless mannequins in the store. Moreau is quick to greet the two of you in his store, with the naga coiling his tail around himself and watching Glory with interested eyes. You introduce the two of them to one another and explain that Moreau might just help the equine hybrid to bear what happened to her a little easier, by using his hypnotic powers. Glory hesitates as you mention hypnosis, but then looks down at herself and soon says, 'Anything that will make this living nightmare more bearable. Please.' Taking the naga shopkeeper aside, you quietly tell him everything that you learned from Glory, and he gives you a nod in understanding.";
	say "     Snaking his way over to Glory, Moreau holds his hand out to her and gives a friendly little bow with his hooded head, then meets her eyes with an intense gaze and says in a very charming voice, 'I will do my very best to help you, miss.' Waiting for the next step, you take a long moment to notice that the naga has already drawn Glory into his spell in that moment, with her standing perfectly still now and just holding his gaze. Listening closely, you catch some snippets of things the naga tells her in low whispers: '...Your brother was called away for something important at work and had to leave. The man in the hotel that woke you was the bellhop...', '...The streets were mostly empty after you fled the Stables Hotel. Still, you know there are dangers out there, so you thought it would be best to seek shelter in the mall...'";

And with that, he gives his full attention to Glory again, while a mannequin showing off a minotaur's stature guides you over to a bench some distance away, eerily silent in its insistence that you sit and wait there. Some time later, Moreau clears his throat and guides Glory's hand to his lips to kiss it. 'Such a pleasure to meet you, miss. Has anyone ever told you that you have quite beautiful eyes?' The equine hybrid's eyes flutter as if she is just awaking from a deep sleep, with Glory then smiling and rubbing the back of her neck. 'Oh, thank you, mister Moreau. That is very nice of you to say. And what an interesting store you have. Er, why was I here again?'";
	say "     The naga smiles and waves over to you as he says, 'Your friend over there brought you, remember? As a newcomer to the mall, you do still need a place to stay after all. I can offer you that, as well as a job. You see, my assistants are obedient, but just a bit empty-headed.' Slithering to the side, Moreau lightly taps the head of the nearest mannequin, creating a hollow sound. 'I could use someone to count the profits. If you work well, I'm sure you'll be able to afford a... different body than that part-equine one soon. My dear, you'd look lovely as a nymph.' You join the two of them and talk a bit with Glory, who seems enormously more stable than just a little while ago, and quite eager for her new job in the Body Shop. Smiling and thanking you for bringing her there, the young woman gives you a quick hug, then moves into the back of the store, where she starts to take stock of Moreau's goods.";

Just softened the raw and jagged bits to make her whole again. It was good of you to bring the lovely girl to me, you have no idea what she was ready to do if this hadn't worked out. You won't have to worry about that anymore now.' With that said, the naga shopkeeper changes topics and directs your attention to his newer mannequins instead, happily offering you to buy what parts interest you.";

As you introduce the two of them to one another, the doberman looks Glory up and down, then nods to you and says, 'So, what brings you to me?' Quietly detailing the things that Glory went through and her desire for protection as well as a way to forget about the living nightmare that her life has become.' Tobias nods and gestures for Glory to come a bit closer, then looks her straight in the eye and says in an earnest tone, 'I can give you what you want. You'll be safe with me, no one's gonna lay a hand on you, including myself. I don't force myself on people. But don't misunderstand - it's not gonna be lazing about either. You've got to obey me, completely, and I'll train you to be a proper companion and pet.'";

So this should be a little bonus: If you come with me, you're gonna be a dobie fairly soon. And I'll give you other things to think about than being raped by big bro.' That last sentence makes Glory gasp and close her mouth with a plop. 'The choice is yours. It's a good offer, honest. Security, peace of mind, food, and a new body. Definitively better than the alternative, with the danger of falling prey to some creature out there - or in here.' He gives a nod to the entrance, where the wolverine guard that slapped Glory's ass is leaning against the wall, munching on some fast food. Glory looks to you in indecision, desperation written on her features, and you give a tiny nod. It was your idea to bring her to Tobias after all. Letting out a sigh, she agrees to the doberman's terms, readily accepting a leather collar that he pulls from one of his pockets, then fastens it around her neck.";
