Mark is a man.
The description of Mark is "[MarkDesc]".
The conversation of Mark is { "<This is nothing but a placeholder!>" }.
The scent of Mark is "     Mark's fur, while well-kempt, is naturally slightly musky, a trait compounded by the undertone of woodsmoke and sawdust. It's a rustic, pleasant scent with a hint of ever-present arousal.".

to say MarkDesc:
	if debugactive is 1:

	say "     Mark is a big and burly polar bear, about seven feet tall and with very broad shoulders. He has the typical snow white fur of his species, with a somewhat anthropomorphic head and a muzzle full of dangerous teeth. Much of the big man's bulk is muscle, filling out the rugged jeans and checkered flannel shirt of his outfit quite well. Overall, the powerful bear's attire is reminiscent of a stereotypical woodcutter, although he clearly has no need for an axe to be reckoned with - the sharp claws on his paw-hands are plenty already.";
	say "     Noticing you looking at him, Mark turns his attention towards you, meeting your gaze with his dark amber eyes. The man then gives you a brief nod, acknowledging your presence.";

Went through high school, got a job or three after that, until I ended up a waiter. And that's where I ended up meeting the love of my life while I was serving him... hmm, I think it was a dish called Ostropel. Romanian restaurant, you know.' Smiling to himself, he continues, 'Living with Jay has been amazing. We've been together five years now. Not in our current forms, of course. These transformations have brought some change, but we still feel the same way about each other. It's just that I am now the big strong one, and he's my little sex kitten. Not that he isn't as headstrong as ever about getting what he wants - it's just that he has different needs. Even though our roles are completely reversed now, we both still love it.'";
	say "     Changing the topic back to himself, the burly polar bear pats the bicep on his right arm and explains, 'As for what I'm doing these days: it's scavenging, out in the city. Not a glamorous job, but a necessary one. The Mall may have a lot in its storerooms, but things won't last forever, so bringing in whatever I can find just makes sense. And if I can find something special for Jay, even better.' He stops for a moment and looks you up and down. 'You know, there are some places and things that I don't go for alone, even if I'm built like a brick house now. Would you like to head out together sometime?[if TimekeepingVar is not 7 and TimekeepingVar is not -1] If you do, meet me here in the morning and we can talk about it some more.'[else]'[end if]";

to say MarkTalk2: [talk about Jay]
	say "     As you ask the large polar bear about his partner, the man grins broadly and replies, 'He is quite something, isn't he? The perfect little package - sexy, funny and strong in character. And what's best, Jay's a total slut for my cock. Hell, I fuck him a few times a day, and I [italic type]still[roman type] wake up with the guy's trembling hole stretched around my shaft. He just climbs on it and rides me. Best way to be woken up, I can tell you that!' The memories of being with his lover create a noticeable tent in Mark's pants, which he adjusts without any shyness, pushing his dick to the side and creating a clearly visible outline of his huge, hard shaft. 'Fuck yeah, I love that man. Been doing that since the day we met, five years ago, even though things were quite different back then of course. I was his bottom boy, not the other way around.'";
	say "     Waving a hand to indicate his muscular bulk, the man explains, 'Forget this bear you see for a moment and imagine a slender dude. Neither a twink nor a bodybuilder, just thin and fit. Anyways, I was working at a downtown restaurant - 'Tati's', a pretty nice Romanian place, little bit fancy - and there was this attractive hunk of a man with some older guy. Oh yeah, Jay was really hot that night, tailored suit and everything. Gave him some winks, and before I knew it, he took me as dessert. Pushed me into the restrooms and fucked my mouth in the handicapped stall.' A pleased sigh crosses his lips, with Mark looking a bit dreamily. 'Barely took three months before he asked for my hand, and I gave it to him.' Raising a large and clawed paw-hand, the bear wiggles his pinkie finger - the only one small enough to fit the broad gold band of a human-sized ring that he proudly presents to you.";

to say MarkDinnerTalk:
	say "     Mark smiles and pats your shoulder in a friendly way. 'As I said, we owe you for the help you gave Jay. Feel free to meet me here in the evening and you'll be treated to a nice dinner. Just be sure you're hungry, alright?'";

to say MarkDinnerInvite:
	if thirst of Mark is 1: [single invite]
		say "     As you bring up the dinner invitation, Mark smiles and nods, then gets up from where he is sitting and hefts the well-stuffed backpack onto his shoulder. 'Okay then, let's get going!' he says in a warm and companionable tone and leads you through the crowd of mall inhabitants, striding towards the food court. His partner Jay is already waiting there for Mark, standing up from a booth he was sitting in to welcome the polar bear with a kiss (after being lifted by strong, white-furred arms). 'We'll have some company for dinner today honey,' Mark explains to his lover when they pull apart again, nodding to you as he does so. 'Hello [if player is not defaultnamed][name of player][else]there[end if], nice to see you again and wanna have dinner with us,' the elf says to you, then asks Mark to put him down and goes to the nearest food counter to have a few words with one of the mall rats. Only a little while later, a large food carrier bag is pushed over the counter, to be picked up by Mark and carried off, with Jay and yourself following behind.";
		say "     'You haven't been at our place yet, have you?' Jay asks conversationally as the two of you walk in the wake of Mark's passage through the busy mall. 'We've managed to negotiate the use of one of the administration offices. Given the circumstances, it is pretty nice and private, as compared to just camping out in one of the stores.' Soon, the three of you arrive in the east wing and the elven man pulls a key from his pocket to unlock a fairly inconspicuous door between two stores. There is a 'Staff only' sign on it, and the doorknob apparently doesn't turn at all, making the key the only way to even open the door. Beyond lies a narrow service corridor, which has a stairway up to the second floor after a little bit. Your little group goes upstairs, passing an office or two until Jay and Mark guide you into a room that has been re-purposed as a kind of loft, with living arrangements and a salvage storage area.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Mark busies himself with putting away his backpack and fresh salvage, leaving you free to look around a little. Relatively spartan as it is, the place still is filled with the atmosphere of being someone's home, and you recognize the effort that the polar bear put into making things comfortable for both of them. For example, the Mall didn't include a furniture store, but there is a large coffee table set up in front of the row of windows overlooking the interior of the east wing of the Smith Haven Mall. Mark must have salvaged it from some place out in the city and carried it here, simply to give his partner a place to sit at without feeling small. A very large mattress dominates the back of the room, complete with an unruly pile of blankets and a few pillows. It is clear that the two of them do make regular use of that, and not just for sleeping.";
		say "     'Come on, you can put down your stuff over there, then sit down. You're our guest so just relax and let us take care of everything,' Jay tells you, then guides you to the coffee table, where you sit down cross-legged while he sets the table, laying out napkins and your choice of chopsticks or cutlery. Sitting down on a footstool just the right height to act as a chair for his diminutive form, the Christmas Elf has a little bit of small talk with you until Mark joins in, sitting down on the ground. 'Dig in everyone,' he says cheerfully, opening the isolated bag and setting box after box of Chinese take-out on the table. The polar bear, elf and yourself have a pleasant dinner together, sharing various dishes between each other and leaving everyone very well-sated.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Afterwards, you have a little more conversation about general themes of the Mall and what is going on in the city, before Jay and Mark eventually call it a night when things wind down. With the elf smiling and saying, 'Thanks again for your help. It was nice of you to step in,' you are led out of their private place.";

to say MarkTalk3: [talk about the wolverines]
	say "     Mark glances over to the muscular mustelids stoically keeping an eye on the entrance for a second, then turns his attention back to you. 'I know that some people do not like the guys because of their uncompromising stance on... just about anything, but let's face it: The Smith Haven Mall would not exist as the refuge it has become without them. Wolverine Security keeps everyone safe from being overrun by the beasts out there that think of nothing but sex anymore, and one should always remember that these men and women have needs too - amplified, burning lusts - and are more than strong enough to just take whomever they wanted from among the refugees. Discipline is what the wolverines live by, and their strength of will to stay true to their jobs should be admired.' Stretching out his arm and indicating the foyer, then the Mall overall, he adds, 'You should have heard the bitching and moaning about the no-littering rules being upheld, along with all of the other regulations the Mall has on its books. I think enduring a bit of over-zealousness is a low price to pay for being kept safe, and I for one like the fact that we're not living in a pig sty too.'";

to say MarkTalk4: [talk about the military]
	say "     Mark's expression darkens noticeably as you bring up the military, and with a frown on his face he replies, 'I met some of the men that were deployed to the city in an attempt to re-establish order during the first week. Good and brave men, all of them. No one knew anything back then, and things quickly went from bad, to worse, to totally fucked up. It was almost more than I - or rather he, the old Mark - could handle.' For a moment, he doesn't say anything more, his eyes filled with a far-away look. 'To this day, it always is disheartening for me to find the remnants of uniforms here or there whenever I go scavenging. Just thinking what became of those brave men. Even had to fight off a number of creatures that still had their dog tags on. None of them remembered a sliver of the men that they once were.'";
	say "     Making a fist, then forcing himself to relax his clawed hand, the large polar bear clears his throat and adds, 'As much as it pains me to say this, with all of us trapped in the city, the army was right to quarantine us. Their initial approach wasn't getting anywhere, and an infection like this couldn't be allowed to spread. I've been at the containment barrier myself, and I know for a fact that they have to be merciless to maintain it. If there was any spot that allowed even a handful of people through, the whole remaining sane population would swamp and overrun them. And that's not counting all of the beasts that would flock to such a crowd to have their fun. So for now, everyone is stuck here. Nothing to be done about it.'";

to say MarkTalk5: [talk about Santa Claws]
	say "     A broad grin spreads over the tall polar bear's face, and he rubs the white fur on his lower arm for a second, then replies, 'He's a really good man, I can tell you that. Funny thing is that I don't know his [italic type]real[roman type] name, even though we've become good friends these last few weeks. He just has so completely stepped into the role of Saint Nick that I don't even know if there is much of a difference anymore. I think that he's one of the reasons the Mall actually can exist as it does, without boiling over from all of the people stuffed into it. Stepping into the Christmas Village just... makes many people forget their troubles, if only for a little while, and Santa does his very best to be a force for good. Which includes being held - and fucked - by a big, warm and so very strong man for some.' Mark seems a little bit embarrassed as he adds that last sentence, and you're fairly sure that he is blushing under his fur.";
	say "     Taking a deep breath, the broad-shouldered ursine calms himself down and explains, 'I wasn't taking things well, when the outbreak started. The initial days, then a hope of being evacuated, followed by witnessing the fate of the soldiers who wanted to help us and then fleeing in panic. Jay got us here to the Mall, and even though we were safe inside its walls, I just couldn't cope. To be honest, I don't remember much of it - mostly crying and despair. Then we met Santa, and he offered... you know. To make me feel better. Give me the fierceness that I would need. And it worked.' Flexing his arms to show off the firm muscles of his ursine physique, Mark leaves things at that, clearly content with his new form. You sense that it wouldn't be a good idea to keep digging into that traumatic time for him, so you quietly let the matter drop.";

to say MarkTalk6: [talk about Krampus]
	say "     Raising his eyebrows as you mention the goat demon living in a cave adjoining the Christmas Village, Mark says, 'You mean Santa's kinky friend? Oh boy, I'll admit that Jay and I did some role-play and maybe a little light bondage over the years, but that guy is [italic type]intense[roman type]. Total leather daddy, you know. He's got a whole collection of restraints and whips in that cave. Not really my cup of tea, but apparently he doesn't lack for partners. Sounds of mixed pain and pleasure can often be heard coming from his lair.'";

to say MarkScavengingTalk:
	say "     As you step up to the large polar bear and ask about details on his scavenging trips, Mark grins broadly and pats your back. 'Well, I can't just tell you where all the best spots for salvage are in the city; that'd possibly make us compete. But hey, there are a number of spots out there that have plenty for both of us - you know, those places where one shouldn't really go alone anyways. So how about it - wanna meet me here in the morning and come with for an excursion sometime?' You reply that you'll think about it and the big man nods, giving you a thoughtful look.";

to say MarkScavengingTrip:
	say "     As you step up to the large polar bear and offer to accompany him on a scavenging trip, Mark grins broadly and puts his clawed hand-paw on your shoulder to give you a companionable squeeze. 'Good choice, friend. Together, we'll be able to go for some truly worthwhile targets.' Adjusting the straps of his backpack, the big man then leads you out through the doors of the Mall, and the two of you wander across the parking lot to go explore the chaos-ruled city. Things are slow at first, with Mark guiding you past countless cars and houses that clearly have already been looted. After an hour or so, he suddenly stretches out his arm to the side, preventing you from walking any further, and nods to something a little distance ahead.";

Pretty well hidden from sight too, and I don't think that anyone or anything even knows that it is there. The problem is keeping it that way. Most of the infected have a good sense of smell, so cutting up a pumpkin might bring them sniffing, and if I carry a 300-pound pumpkin off in one piece, I'll be vulnerable to anything wanting to jump me,' the large polar bear says, then pats your shoulder with a clawed paw-hand and grins. 'That's where you come in now.' [or]'Ready for another trip to the pumpkin patch? Hopefully it's still our little secret. We were careful after all. Same plan as before - I carry one of those big things, and you keep lookout,' the large polar bear says, then pats your shoulder with a clawed paw-hand and grins.

With that said, the snow-white bear crouches down and wraps both arms around the pumpkin, lifting it with a strained grunt.
