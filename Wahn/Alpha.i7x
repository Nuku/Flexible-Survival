to say AlphaOnedesc:
	say "     Alpha has a fairly unique body plan, consisting of a slender, humanoid upper body and starting at the hips beneath that eight long tentacles, lined with a double row of suckers all along their undersides. He doesn't seem to have any issue using them as legs, as the muscular appendages brace against the floor easily and keep his upper body straight. The human-octopus hybrid's skin is smooth and patterned in shades of orange and red, but appears able to shift to other shades too, as you can see traces of blue ripple over it here and there. Alpha doesn't seem to need moisture to sustain him, making a land-walking lifestyle possible without trapping himself due to dependence on bodies of water anywhere nearby.";
	say "     Noticing your attention, the being turns his androgynously-featured head to look at you, his solidly green eyes with cross-shaped irises meeting your gaze. The throng of countless smaller tentacles that form his 'hair' twitch and move a little as [if mindshield helmet is not equipped]you feel him reaching out for your mind, reading through your surface thoughts as if they were an open book[else]he reflexively seems to want to read your mind, with the helmet on your head giving a little hum as it protects you from that mental invasion[end if]. After a moment or two, he shrugs and turns his attention elsewhere.";
	if "Herm_Rescued" is listed in Traits of AlphaOne:
		say "     Not too far off from where Alpha usually resides, his herm parent is stretched out on one of the sofas in here. The man has been dressed in fairly normal clothes and a blanked covers his sleeping form. From what Alpha said before, he'll keep the former researcher unconscious until he has had the time to remove the influence of the thought eater from him completely. The hybrid can often be seen taking care of him, a comfortingly 'normal' and human activity for such a strange being.";

It is who I am, what I am, and most of the time, so very easy. For example, I feel a mind-glow walking along the sidewalk outside. It... no, she, is hungry and in a hurry. She knows this building is occupied, so is worried about being so close and wants to get past quickly. That much I can just sense without even putting any effort into it.' Wiggling his eyebrow-ridges, Alpha adds, 'It's automatic, kind of like seeing in color, or reacting to sound. Going further, that's what will take some concentration, and training.' He closes his eyes at that point, and you see a green-blue glow flicker along his head tentacles, just as you hear the bark of a dog from outside. In reaction to you raising your eyebrows, he nods. 'Yeah, made her bark to demonstrate. Didn't make any changes otherwise, so now she's running off.'";

'For now, staying hidden is the most important first step. I will need time to gather my strength, training mental disciplines to master them. There is little doubt that a confrontation with my progenitor lies in the future, and I must be ready for when that occurs. You have seen his influence, and know that he is relentless.'

To him, there is but one goal - a world that is one mind and endless host bodies. He will be alone there, having consumed all. While that plan has absolute security and almost godlike power on the plus side, it is the most extreme and born from his fundamental dislike of humanity and all its newly created offshoots.'

		say "     Planting his hands on your shoulders, Alpha leans over you and brings his face close to yours. 'I love doing things like this with you!' With that said, he brings your lips together, impatiently slipping his tongue into your mouth in a French kiss. You decide to roll with it, enthusiastically participating in his still more eager than skillful bout of making out, continuing to give him some helpful advice to advance his sexual education, in between moments of tongue-wrestling with each other. The pleasurable little interlude comes to an end a few moments later, when you feel something down at your crotch, kind of stroking over your skin. Alpha's tentacle-like cock has emerged from his genital-slit again, and it's ready for some action! Glancing down, you see the appendage flex move, its human-like mushroom head almost seeming to look around. You begin to reach out to guide him to your hole, but Alpha's already on it, lifting your legs with his tentacles and spreading them, then moving his crotch closer to your own.";

		say "     Being lined up with his target, there's nothing to stop Alpha anymore, and he pushes his hips against yours eagerly while letting his cock press into you. With the appendage being prehensile and able to adjust itself for finding just the right angle, he takes to fucking like a fish to swimming, easily penetrating your body and sliding inside. The little nubs along his shaft's sides send shockingly pleasant tingles up your spine as they slip past your opening, and for a moment, you just close your eyes and focus on the sensations of taking him into your body. 'Fuuuck yeah! I love the feeling of your ass around me!' Alpha says somewhat breathlessly, then stops talking, focusing his attention on fucking instead. You can feel his tentacles wrap tighter around you, really getting a grip so he can ram forward, burying his shaft in your hole with vigorous thrusts.";
		say "     Bucking up with a gasp as Alpha soon hits your prostate full on, you open your eyes and are treated to an impressive, almost hypnotic show of colors as tones of red and yellow pulse across the hybrid's skin in rhythm with his movements. Letting the energy of the moment fill you too, you push your hips up to meet the next yellow-pulsing thrust of his hips, making both of you moan out loud as he goes even deeper than before, his ribbed shaft flexing and rubbing pleasure-spots you barely knew you had. The eager fuck escalates at that point, getting ever more frantic as the two of you hold onto each other tightly, building up to an explosive finish as Alpha hammers himself home one last time. As he orgasms and begins to pulse thick, creamy seed into your welcoming hole, all coordination of Alpha's chromatophores seems to go out the window for a little while, as his whole body seems to pulsate in chaotic colors.";

to say Mathiasdesc:
	if "Awakened" is not listed in Traits of Mathias:
		say "     Mathias is a Caucasian man of slender build, with mid-length blond hair. By your best guess, he is of Scandinavian heritage, with fairly pale skin and strikingly handsome face. It isn't difficult to imagine his ancestors taking Viking longboats to raid coastal villages in Europe. As for the man himself - you don't actually know all that much about him, other than that he was somehow involved in the secret research going on underneath the Trevor Labs. Whatever his role there was, when the nanite apocalypse hit, things went off the rails and he ended up the hermaphrodite breeding slave of the Thought Eater, and the designated incubator of Alpha.";
		say "     When agreeing to harbor the octopus hybrid as part of his escape plan, you insisted on taking the man along too. Alpha did just that, but he had to put Mathias into a sleepless trance to keep his connection to the Thought Eater from betraying your location. You wonder if and when he'll be able to separate Mathias from his master...";
	else:
		say "     Awake Mathias Desc.";

instead of conversing Mathias:
	if "Awakened" is not listed in Traits of Mathias:
		say "     The man is in a dreamless sleep state right now. No chance of having any sort of conversation with him right now.";
	else:
		say "     Awake Mathias Talk.";
