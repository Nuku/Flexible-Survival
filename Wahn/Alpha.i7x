to say AlphaOnedesc:
	say "     Alpha has a fairly unique body plan, consisting of a slender, humanoid upper body and starting at the hips beneath that eight long tentacles, lined with a double row of suckers all along their undersides. He doesn't seem to have any issue using them as legs, as the muscular appendages brace against the floor easily and keep his upper body straight. The human-octopus hybrid's skin is smooth and patterned in shades of orange and red, but appears able to shift to other shades too, as you can see traces of blue ripple over it here and there. Alpha doesn't seem to need moisture to sustain him, making a land-walking lifestyle possible without trapping himself due to dependence on bodies of water anywhere nearby.";
	say "     Noticing your attention, the being turns his androgynously-featured head to look at you, his solidly green eyes with cross-shaped irises meeting your gaze. The throng of countless smaller tentacles that form his 'hair' twitch and move a little as [if mindshield helmet is not equipped]you feel him reaching out for your mind, reading through your surface thoughts as if they were an open book[else]he reflexively seems to want to read your mind, with the helmet on your head giving a little hum as it protects you from that mental invasion[end if]. After a moment or two, he shrugs and turns his attention elsewhere.";
	if "Herm_Rescued" is listed in Traits of AlphaOne:
		say "     Not too far off from where Alpha usually resides, his herm parent is stretched out on one of the sofas in here. The man has been dressed in fairly normal clothes and a blanked covers his sleeping form. From what Alpha said before, he'll keep the former researcher unconscious until he has had the time to remove the influence of the thought eater from him completely. The hybrid can often be seen taking care of him, a comfortingly 'normal' and human activity for such a strange being.";

instead of sniffing AlphaOne:
	say "     The human-octopus hybrid an odd, but pleasant, spicy scent.";

to say AlphaOneTalk1: [talk about his powers]

	if "Mindshield Protected Invite" is listed in Traits of AlphaOne:
		say "He pushes himself up on the tentacles forming his lower half and glances down at you. 'I didn't make you invite me, remember? That little helmet you had on made sure of that,' the hybrid then adds, sounding more amused than offended. ";
	else:
		say "He moves forward on the tentacles forming his lower half and reaches out, putting a slender hand on your shoulder. 'That decision, you came to all on your own. I told you I want to try out whether cooperation is a possibility,' the hybrid then adds, and you can't help but feel that he says the truth. ";
	say "'As for how it feels to have these powers... hmm, it might be difficult for other beings to grasp, but being able to reach out and touch other minds isn't some special ability that you only turn on when you need it. It is who I am, what I am, and most of the time, so very easy. For example, I feel a mind-glow walking along the sidewalk outside. It... no, she, is hungry and in a hurry. She knows this building is occupied, so is worried about being so close and wants to get past quickly. That much I can just sense without even putting any effort into it.' Wiggling his eyebrow-ridges, Alpha adds, 'It's automatic, kinda like seeing in color, or reacting to sound. Going further, that's what will take some concentration, and training.' He closes his eyes at that point, and you see a green-blue glow flicker along his head tentacles, just as you hear the bark of a dog from outside. In reaction to you raising your eyebrows, he nods. 'Yeah, made her bark to demonstrate. Didn't make any changes otherwise, so now she's running off.'";

to say AlphaOneTalk2: [talk about his plans]
	say "     Glancing your way, the hybrid raises one tentacle and waves its tip around a little, indicating the building around you. Then a band of shifting colors ripples over his skin, making it appear that he's transparent as he matches the background almost perfectly for a second before reverting to his normal patterning. 'For now, staying hidden is the most important first step. I will need time to gather my strength, training mental disciplines to master them. There is little doubt that a confrontation with my progenitor lies in the future, and I must be ready for when that occurs. You have seen his influence, and know that he is relentless.' Alpha's cross-shaped irises focus on you and he waits for a few seconds to allow the memory of a slavishly obedient researcher in the Trevor Labs underground rise in your mind.";
	if "Herm_Rescued" is listed in Traits of AlphaOne:
		say "     'So, survival first. As for other plans beyond that...' he shrugs his shoulders. 'The world is in flux, and I'm still deciding what to make of it. The fact that you've invited me here of your own free will shows that total domination as my progenitor desires isn't the only option. To him, there is but one goal - a world that is one mind and endless host bodies. He will be alone there, having consumed all. While that plan has absolute security and almost godlike power on the plus side, it is the most extreme and born from his fundamental dislike of humanity and all its newly created offshoots.' That said, Alpha pauses for a moment, his eyes wandering up and down over your form, lingering here and there. 'I'm less set in my way. There might be... alternatives. We'll see.' A slight movement plays over his lips as he says this, with the hint of a smile. Then he waves you off, with the topic clearly over, for now.";
