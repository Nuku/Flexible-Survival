Half-Renovated Room is Northwest of Grey Abbey Library.
The description of Half_Renovated Room is "[LibrarySideRoomDesc]";

to say LibrarySideRoomDesc: 
	say "     This large room of the Grey Abbey Library seems to be where most of the furniture of the old abbey ended up when the building was converted to its new purpose. With its high ceiling, ample floor-space and even a big fireplace, it could have been a dining hall or something in the past. Now it is mostly filled with numerous pieces of furniture, some stacked quite high and partially covered in white sheets. The two still accessible walls are covered in scaffolding and show signs of recent work on them - looks like workers were in the progress of refurbishing the room for library use when the nanite outbreak began.";
	if Skarnoth is in Half-Renovated Room:
		say "     Since you brought the demon prince Skarnoth here and securely attached the long chain on his collar to the scaffolding, the imprisoned predator has done his best to improve his comfort of his prison. A soft (if somewhat threadbare and stained) couch has been dragged to stand against the back wall and shows signs of being used as a bed. He even found a high-backed armchair somewhere, which is now set up next to the fireplace. Sitting in it, the demon awaits you, wearing an arrogant expression as if he was a king awaiting supplicants.";

Section 1 - Description

Skarnoth is a man. The hp of Skarnoth is usually 0.
The icon of Skarnoth is Figure of SkarnothClothed_icon.
The description of Skarnoth is "[SkarnothDesc]".
The conversation of Skarnoth is { "Woof." }.
SkarnothLibraryEntry is a number that varies. [when he was brought in]

to say SkarnothDesc:
	if debugactive is 1:
		say "DEBUG -> HP: [hp of Skarnoth], LEVEL: [level of Skarnoth], LIBRARY ENTRY TURN: [SkarnothLibraryEntry] <- DEBUG[line break]";	
	say "     Skarnoth the demon prince is a magnificent specimen of masculinity, with a strikingly handsome face framed by jet-black curls of long hair. His firm pecs and six-pack abs would fit an underwear model - which he kind of is, as you stripped him of his regalia, taking off anything but a skin-tight black thong. The strip of fabric does more to show off the bulge of his package than to conceal anything.";
	say "     Letting your gaze stray from the flawless, pale skin of the demon's torso, his similarity to the perfection a greek statue does diminish a bit - as Skarnoth's otherworldy nature shows clearly on the rest of his body. Starting with a few small scales on the sides of his upper body, then larger and more solid ones on his hips and down the legs, the infernal being has overlapping, flexible scales. His feet bear sharp claws, as do the hands (if a bit smaller ones), and further scale-plates make it appear like he is wearing elaborate bracers as well as pauldrons to cover his shoulders. A pair of large horns curving up from his head complete the image of a handsome and dangerous predator.";

The scent of Skarnoth is "     Skarnoth has an almost entrancing, sexy scent. A pleasant tingle runs down your spine as you take a deep sniff, breathing in the masculine aroma and pheromones, underlain with a little bit of brimstone".

Section 2 - Talking

instead of conversing the Skarnoth:
	if (hp of Skarnoth > 0):
