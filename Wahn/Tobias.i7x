Section 1 - Events

after going to Smith Haven Mall Lot East while HP of Tobias is 0 and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
	say "     Walking over the expansive parking lot of the Smith Haven Mall, you let your gaze wander over the countless parked cars: many stand neatly aligned in their squares, most likely belonging to people that never left the safe confines of the mall, or possibly those that never made it back here at all. Others are more scattered, often in clumps around the entrances and exits of the lot, from when people started to panic and got involved in all sorts of collisions and accidents. The crunching noise of glass shards under your feet makes you stop and look at the nearest damaged car, half-hidden behind the delivery truck its front is crumpled against. You can't help but idly wonder what may have happened to the driver on the fateful day that the nanite apocalypse came into full swing.";
	say "     As you stand there, movement on the far side of the car catches your eye. An anthro doberman dressed in jeans and an open vest, as well as black leather gloves, steps into view from the other side of the truck, holding the leashes for two other dobermans, one male one female. They are anthro canines, just like him, but in sharp contrast, they are naked and on all fours with collars and muzzles on them. The leashed bitch looks back at you and gives a whine, trying to move back behind the truck, but her owner(?) is having none of it, looking impatiently at the other dobie and keeping her on a tight leash. 'What is it now?' the standing man barks out, then follows her gaze to you and scoffs at her. 'Oh? Being watched by [ObjectPro of player] has your panties in a twist? Let me remind you - animals don't wear any of those. You're a pet, bitch, and not an obedient one right now. I told you to do your business [italic type]now[roman type]!'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Cowering before the sharp and commanding tone of her master, the female canine pushes past her hesitation and pushes her hips down with spread legs, releasing a small trickle of urine onto the asphalt. 'Wasn't so hard after all, eh?' the standing doberman comments in a biting tone, then gives both of the leashes a short dug. 'Now that that's done for, let's go meet our new acquaintance,' he says next, then guides his pets around the car to come to stand before you. The male collared dobie sits on his haunches after a second, looking up with interest, while the female hangs her head in obvious shame and remains standing. Ignoring the reactions of his submissive companions, the clothed doberman steps forward and offers you a hand in greeting.";
	say "     'Pleasure to meet you, I'm Tobias Black.' While you tell him your own name, he pulls a business card out of a breast pocket and hands it to you. It reads, 'Tobias Black - Animal Handler, Trainer, Breeder' and has a stylized paw-print in the upper left corner. 'Sorry that I didn't acknowledge you earlier. You know how it is with dogs in training, one has to address any disobedience immediately to avoid any bad habits forming. Dane here is about fully trained by now, but Cara still needs work. But don't you worry, she'll be an excellently obedient bitch in no time at all.' The man's behavior towards you is markedly different from the side his pets experience, and he seems very friendly, even jovial. He seems to want to chat a bit with you, and is clearly waiting for you to say something.";

to say TobiasTalk1: [Ask him about himself]
	say "     'Oh, I've been a dog trainer for close to ten years now. Started my business after coming back from the war. Which one, you ask? One of the shitty ones that no one even remembers, in the Kosovo. Stopping one group of asshole Europeans from stringing up their neighbors, and vice versa, at times.' He shrugs and brushes the topic aside, then says, 'Started with just two kennels and a bitch. Really good one, though. Purebred puppies go for quite a bit, and the ones I didn't sell got trained. Ever seen 'The Revivicator II', 'Mall Pig' or 'Inspector Gumbo'? All my dogs in those movies.' Reaching out to pat Dane on the head, the man adds, 'This current crisis hit out of the blue, but I was prepared for [italic type]something[roman type] to go down, so my place is well stocked. And apparently my skills are quite useful these days too.'";

to say TobiasTalk2: [Ask what he is doing at the mall]
	say "     'Oh, I'm just stopping by for some supplies and a good warm meal. This is one of the few places that one can relax and let your guard down. Also, at some point it is important to socialize newly trained pets with large groups of people. That can bring some previously hidden issues to the forefront so they can be dealt with - like Cara's little hangup [if HP of Tobias is 0]just now[else]when we met[end if].";

to say TobiasTalk3: [Talk about dog training]
	say "     Tobias gives you a knowing nod and clears his throat. 'The difficult part about any training with canines isn't to get them started doing something. No, it's keeping them from being obsessed with things once they start. Here, let me demonstrate.' Stepping forward, the dog trainer loosens the straps of the leather muzzle on Dane and pulls it off, then tells him, 'Go on boy, lick your balls.' In reply, Dane gives a happy bark, followed by the submissive dobie curling up on the ground and lapping at his own crotch. Watching the naked young man pleasure himself, Tobias adds, 'It wouldn't do to have a movie dog actually go through with mauling an actor instead of just lightly biting them in the ass, so control is a [italic type]very[roman type] important thing. Even if they do not want to follow a command, it [italic type]must[roman type] be obeyed instantly. Just look at Dane for example.'";
	say "     The other dobie is by now fully erect, his knotted cock sticking out of his sheath and being eagerly lapped at by the canine's long, floppy tongue. 'Freeze!' Tobias suddenly barks out, with the trained anthro immediately obeying. 'Very good,' the dog trainer says and crouches down next to his pet, stroking Dane's head and scratching him behind his ears. Then he reaches out to grab the other man's cock and begins to stroke it with an expert grip, quickly getting Dane to climax and shoot his load. Tobias milks the dog until he finishes shooting the last drops of cum, then holds out his hand for the dobie pet to lick it clean of all traces of his own seed. Standing up again, Tobias grins at you and concludes with the words, 'And that's how you do it. Discipline and rewards in just the right proportions. It'll do the trick very well, I tell you.'";

to say TobiasTalk4: [Offer to have sex with him]
	say "     A smile spreads over Tobias's face as he checks you out, followed by him giving a pleased nod. 'Definitely an interesting offer you're making. Not quite the time or place for it, right here and now, but I'll keep your interest in mind. There should be some opportunities for a hookup sometime, if you're still game then. But you better be prepared for a workout - I'm a fairly demanding partner in bed, just so you know.";

to say TobiasTalk10: [Ask who Dane and Cara are]
	say "     Tobias shrugs and replies, 'Can't say I particularly care who they [italic type]were[roman type]. They've accepted collars and my authority over them. I'll mold these two into something exceptional.' Glancing down at Cara, he adds, 'Might just breed this one, once I finish her training fully.' You see the anthro bitch's eyes widen at his casual comment, yet that is all the reaction she shows.";

to say TobiasTalk11: [Ask how he can do this to the other canines. They're just like him after all]
	say "     Tobias chuckles and shakes his head. 'It's easy to think so, but no. Even among humans, there are top dogs and... betas. Those who can do the things that need doing and those who meekly go along. I've got what it takes to make it in this crazy new world. And thanks to me, these two aren't stumbling around lost in the streets, being preyed on by who knows what. Don't think I kidnapped them either - they begged me to take them in, and I explained that I demand complete obedience before I ever put on the collars.'";

to say TobiasTalk12: [Tell him that treating people like animals is wrong]
	say "     Raising one eyebrow and giving you a stoic look, the doberman shrugs after a second or two. 'We'll have to agree to disagree then. Just look at all the things going on throughout the whole city right now. At least my pets will be well cared for and suffer through nothing more than a bit of tough love and discipline. I don't beat them or force myself on anyone.' The canine man's expression hardens visibly as he gives a wave of his hand that somehow seems to encompass the whole city. 'The world has changed, as you might know. Or maybe you haven't yet realized just how much it has. I've been through war, and have seen with my own eyes all of the beastly things that humans are capable of. Even without taking on the looks of animals as many do now, this always was inside all of us. Strip away civil society and you are left with a place that just eats up the weak-willed and timid. Trust me, it is a mercy that I have adopted Dane and Cara and am molding them into something that will have a proper place in this harsh world.'";

to say TobiasTalk13: [Ask if he couldn't instead train his pets to be strong and confident in their own right]
	say "     Tobias frowns a little and shrugs. 'Could I? It's doubtful. Some people just aren't cut out to take care of themselves all on their own. Society just coddled them all this time, so they survived. The merciless place that the streets of this city have become certainly aren't a place for such experiments now. Secondly, I'm not a charity. If I spend my time and supplies to train a dog, then it better be my property, or well-paid for in advance.'";

to say TobiasTalk14: [Demand that he free his pets]
	say "     Letting out a derisive snort, Tobias gives you a rude gesture and says, 'Up yours! Really, what else do you want besides it? Shall I raise my tail and shoot rainbows out of my ass too? No, these two are mine. I took them in, fed them, cared for them and trained them. And even if I abandoned all the time and resources I invested - should I just let them loose to be snatched up by someone who is [italic type]guaranteed[roman type] to treat them worse? Trust me, there are plenty of predators even inside the mall. Just take that Logan dude in the wolverine guards - he's been looking at Cara like a slab of meat. Without my leash on her, he'd have pushed her down and pounded her right the first time he saw her.'";

to say TobiasTalk15: [Ask to buy one or both of his pets]
	say "     The anthro doberman looks at you with a thoughtful expression, then slowly shakes his head. 'I don't think so. Not yet, at least. Cara still needs more training and I might keep her to breed with anyways. Meanwhile, Dane is further along, but there are some little things left to polish. Plus, I don't have a replacement for him yet. Training pets in pairs makes a lot of sense, you know. The newer one will have an example to look to and the experienced one gets a refresher of the things taught that really drives them home.' Glancing around thoughtfully for a second, Tobias adds, 'I guess that is another reason why I am here too. Finding a good candidate to train. Most of the weak people out on the streets have already met their fate, one way or another. It really is much easier to start with a new pet that hasn't been driven out of their mind by constant rape, even without having to squash the supposed alpha owner.'";

to say TobiasTalk16: [Ask if you can pet his dogs]
	say "     Tobias smiles and nods for you to go ahead. 'Sure thing, but no groping please.' You walk over and crouch down between the two collared anthros, patting their gleaming coats of fur. Dane readily leans into your touches, his tail wagging in obvious pleasure, while Cara seems more reserved, trembling a little as you first reach out for her. Only when your continued stroking continues to stay away from her privates and (quite nice and shapely) breasts does she relax, wagging her tail too.";

to say TobiasTalk17: [Ask if you can fuck his dogs]
	say "     The doberman's eyebrows rise as he gives you a surprised look. 'Right to the point, aren't you? But no, you may not. I'm training canine companions and working animals, not rape-bait for the streets that spread their legs for anyone at the drop of a hat.' Stepping up to his dogs, Tobias pets Dane and Cara, who wag their tails eagerly, clearly being happy to be under his care right now.";
