to say Gregorydesc:
	say "     Gregory is a fit human soldier of Caucasian descent, who underwent partial transformation into a wyvern before you and Urik rescued him from that fate. While the young man is still mostly human, some parts of his body conform to a different blueprint, which is made quite clear by the variations in his skin color, as that goes to the more earthy tones of a wyvern's scales along his arms, lower legs and the upper part of his head that is now sporting a pair of horns. Having acquired short claws on his thumb, index and middle fingers, Gregory's ring and index fingers have been repurposed completely, now extending backwards as long, thin supports for a bat-like wing membrane.";
	say "     As he currently is still passed out after his time in the wyvern egg/cocoon, you have an unimpeded view of Gregory's privates, which aren't quite human anymore. His dickhead has a more pointy shape now, and there are some interesting-looking ridges along his shaft. You can't be sure, but you'd guess that the solid twelve inches that his cock reaches when hard are also an upgrade done by the nanites.";

instead of sniffing Gregory:
	say "     The wyvern hybrid has a nice, masculine scent, with an underlying spicy aroma. That must be coming from his wyvern side, as it's definitely not human.";

instead of conversing Gregory:
	if HP of Gregory is 1: [unconscious in the library]
		say "     He's unconscious, so don't expect too much response from him...";
	say "[GregoryTalkMenu]";

Finally, you wrap your tale up by going into detail about Urik and yourself interrupting his transformation, you explain that he's in the library now, and you're just waiting for him to wake up.
