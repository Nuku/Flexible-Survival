	say "     Mortimer is a vaguely humanoid goo person, though being quite a particularly soft and squishy-looking example of his kind. Unless he's moving around or concentrating on holding a shape, much of his mass seems to want to droop down, giving him a half-melted, moist appearance. The goo-man's body is teal in color, filled with some swirls and streaks that are more milky white, making him only semitransparent overall. You can make out some solid shapes within too, many of which appear to be keys. Seems that he's dealt with the lack of pants pockets by simply storing items he needs within his own form.";
	say "     As he notices your attention on himself, Mortimer pulls himself into a more presentable shape for a moment, with correct human proportions. The smarmy grin on his face and a pompadour haircut complete the image of a human male. Somehow you can't help but feel that he'll try to sell you a used car in a moment.";

[TODO: Mention Blue if the Player does know them - and vice versa]

instead of conversing Mortimer:
	if "IntroEvent_Done" is not listed in Traits of Mortimer: [first encounter intro]
		say "     Just as you are about to step up to the gate and call out to the goo person, you see two people step out of one of the side passages a little bit further back, providing access to some of the countless storage bays in the facility. It is an anthro bulldog wearing nothing but a ratty pair of jeans, as well as another goo who looks pretty much identical to the gate guard. The two of them are talking as they approach, and you manage to catch part of it, with the bulldog saying, '...keep the little slut safely locked up, Mortimer. Even if she bangs on the door or something like that, alright? Not quite done training her to accept her new role. And if a dude [italic type]does[roman type] show up here asking for his sister...' The goo person next to him raises a hand to interrupt him, then replies with a slimy (literally dripping) grin, 'Say no more, I'll just inform him that what is stored - or not stored here - is the private business of my customers. And if he becomes aggressive or anything, you know how tight the place can be. No worries.'";
		say "     After the last words were said, he casually waves towards the deeper part of the walled in facility, where you can make out four additional copies of his goo form move around and work. The next thing that happens as the duo reaches the other goo standing at the door buzzer is that Mortimer just steps up and merges with his copy, becoming half a foot taller and girthier. The newly merged being still looks the same in all other respects, and just continues talking in the same tone as before. 'Before you go, I do want to remind you again of the storage fees. Before any old or new deposited goods are accessed, you'll have to pay up.' Grunting under his breath, the anthro dog replies, 'Yeah, yeah, I remember. Hard not to, with the pain of lugging all those bottles of milk and cum here constantly.' With a sly smile creeping over his face, Mortimer spreads his arms as he offers, 'If you prefer, we can switch you to the alternate payment plan. Just say the word.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You can see the fur on the bulldog's back fluff up as his hackles rise reflexively, and he almost barks back, 'Hell no, Mort! I'll get you the payment. Her and the others are MINE, you're not allowed to tap em for fluids yourself!' 'As you wish,' Mortimer tells the canine in a tone that doesn't quite hide his amusement at the reaction, then presses the button to unlock the door. The muscular bulldog turns his head to the goo and grumbles, 'Why don't you just let me jerk one out onto ya, or something? That'd be less work than carrying the stuff here.' The goo person gives him a cold stare, then replies, 'That'd be... trashy. Just pay up in the usual way. Also, you've got nine units in use right now. Bet ya'd be shooting blanks before long - and would you really be in the mood to train your girl at that point?'";
		say "     With a grunt, the bulldog steps outside and pulls the door shut behind him, then gives you a predatory glance and kind of lingers on the sidewalk. You can see his lips starting to pull back as he works himself up to attack, maybe planning to add you to his stable inside. Then suddenly, you hear a sharp whistle from inside. Mortimer calls out, 'Hey Zane! No fighting with prospective customers! Take it down the street at least!' The anthro canine still looks just about ready to jump you, only holding himself back as Mortimer adds, 'Control yourself, or you'll forfeit on your stored goods, you hear me?!' Growling, the bulldog stalks off after that. Keeping an eye on him until he takes a turn around a corner not too far away, you're soon left standing in front of the storage facility alone.";
		if PlayerMet of Blue Speaker is true:
			say "     Having seen the goo person act and talk, you can't help but be reminded of Blue in the mall, who appears to be a somewhat related type of goo. In this case though, it doesn't look like there are individual personalities to the separate parts of the whole. That makes you wonder if Mortimer just grew enough mass on his own and learned to split himself into copies, or if his personality overwhelmed any other from people he may or may not have absorbed.";

		say "     As you approach the sturdy metal bars of the door and call out to the goo person, he pulls his half-melted body into a more presentable shape for a moment, with correct human proportions. The smarmy grin on his face and a pompadour haircut complete the image of a human male. 'Well hello there, nice to see a new face around here,' he says in an overly friendly tone, wanting to draw you in. 'I'm Mortimer. Step up and let me explain about this place. Since the current... situation started', the goo explains, waving a hand airily to indicate the ongoing nanite apocalypse, 'my little location here is offering new and expanded services for the customer's convenience.' You see a glint of light on his face at that moment - did he actually just move a gold tooth from inside the goo to wow you with its gleam? Wow, he really matches all the checkboxes for a sleazy salesman. With an unbroken grin on his face, Mortimer winds up for his sales pitch, now standing just beyond the door.";
		say "     'Got a piece of eye candy that keeps wandering off and letting others have a taste? Or maybe some sketchy neighbors around that might snatch what's yours? Maybe a new four-legged furry friend that you caught out on the streets and had some fun with, but don't wanna explain to the family?' Adding a wink as he says the last part, Mortimer makes a sweep with his arm to indicate the complex behind him. 'I've got the solution for all your problems right here. Person storage services. Who or what you bring here to store will be kept private, and your stored property safe and secure. They'll be kept well fed and watered, with you being able to access your storage space at any time. What you do in it is your business. And I am offering all of this for a nicely low and affordable price.' With that said, the goo pauses to give you a chance to react, showing a smile on his face.";

Book 1 - Capture/Drug/Purchase
More secure area people will not be available right off the bat (mall ect.) unless there are a certain amount of people already in the storage area. This is just to show you are becoming a better predator and are able to grab higher tier targets.

Capture: The capture method may or not be available for all candidates. This method will involve using your stats/feats to immobilize people and take them to the storage area. "Warning": Capturing people will not put them into slut mode and will actually keep them in the non-con form until you either get your hands on the drug, or another prerequisite is met.

Drug: The drug method actually has you drugging the people and while they are out of it you take them to the storage unit. This way will be far easier for most people as their is no stat/feat check, they will however need to have the drug in their inventory. "Warning": With this method the person will still start in non-con, it's just a simpler/guaranteed way to acquire them.

Purchase: The purchase method is reserved for characters like those in the Shag Shack, these people will not be able to be captured or drugged, they are exclusive.

Book 2 - Storage

Location: On the street connected to the Library.

NPC - Storage Owner: Mortimer - Male - Slime

NPC - Scientist: Mr. Chimic - Male - Gecko

Book 3 - Sex and Advancement

	Chapter 1 - Sex Groups
	Every character will start at the non-con setting, but characters will then be divided into two separate groups.

		Section 1 - Broken Group
		The first group will be called the "Broken" group, for this group they will not require the drug to become sluts they simply require to be fucked repeatedly. Examples of people that would fit this group would be Sarah, Sex Slave Eric, Sven, and Glory. The one downside of this group is that there is no way to "stay at the level you want", however this group is by far the easiest to slutify.

			Part 1 - Planned
			*Eric
			*Joshiro
			Sarah

			Part 2 - Potential
			Sven
			Glory
			Amy
			Candy
			Karen
			Val
			Xerxes
			Helen

		Section 2 - Fighter Group
		The second group will be called the fighter group, for this group they will require the drug to advance from non-con to slut mode. Examples of people that would fit this groups would be Skarnoth, Chase, and Garth. The upside of this group is that as long as you don't use drugs you can keep them at the level you want, however this group is harder to slutify as you will need the drug to progress.

			Part 1 - Planned
			Skarnoth
			Chase
			Imps (all four count as one space)
			Brutus
			*Danny

			Part 2 - Potential
			Korvin
			Landon
			Barret
			Arthur
			Reece
			Garth
			Andy
			Logan

Chapter 2 - Sex Progression
Sex progression can have from 3-5 different levels depending on the character. These levels are actually just variations on the same "standard" scene. This means that the player will feel like "omg they are becoming more of a slut toy to use!", but for the writer it's actually just a simple "alright on this level this bitch says this and on the next I just tweak it".
