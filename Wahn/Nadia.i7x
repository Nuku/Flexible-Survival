Yet she bravely forges on, chest heaving, talons gripping the ground tightly as bit by bit, the egg is nudged from her womb, through her tunnel and out into the world. Tears well up in Nadia's eyes and seep into her feathers, but she doesn't scream or curse, instead bearing the pain with an immense inner strength, letting out a huge gasp as the egg finally crowns and leaves her body. The laying complete, having taken an hour or so, she struggles to push herself upright, wiping tears of pain and love alike from her eyes.";

The effort still clearly tires her out, the avian puffing and panting in time with the throbbing of her womb as her body prepares to release the fully-developed egg, but she doesn't look like she's in serious pain. The laying takes about half an hour, the egg eventually crowning and sliding free of her pussy to land on one of the cushions of her nest.";

Soon enough cracks, appear and widen before the eggshell finally splits, spilling a small chick into Nadia's arms, still damp with egg fluids. Humming softly, Nadia cradles the newborn to her breast to nurse, the chick painlessly gripping her nipple with the tip of their beak. Fluffy down falls to the floor as the chick suckles greedily, growing and gaining their colorful young adult plumage in a matter of moments. At last, they pop free, and Nadia gives her new chick a soft pat on the head before setting them down.";

Having exceeded all expectations, even her own, it's quite impossible to imagine how she can appear any more fecund than she already is. With how readily and enthusiastically her body has adapted to the immense number of impregnations and births she's gone through despite her petite form - resulting in lush, fertile hips and sumptuous, firm breasts beyond imagination - she looks practically fit to be worshipped, her entire body swaying erotically with every step she takes. The crimson, wavy waterfall of her hair cascades freely down to the back of her knees, and each and every one of her feathers are brilliant and beautiful, glowing with their own inner radiance.";

Her generous, tantalizing nipples are now constantly stiff, and her slick, sensitive cunt is swollen with heat and fertility even when she's pregnant. Nadia looks absolutely blissful and croons maternally as she rubs her belly, suggestive of the hypertrophied womb and ovaries that lie beneath, ever ready to be bred with more eggs.";

Her feathers resplendent in color, her flowing crimson hair and tail-feathers working together to reach the floor in one unbroken line, she manages to add a splash of color to the library all by herself - and her blissful face doesn't hurt, either. Full, firm breasts promise adequate nursing for the next generation she easily ushers into the world by virtue of her massive hips that force wide her stance, and her pussy has finally joined her nipples in exposing themselves, puffy, wet and eager to be bred over and over again.";

Repeated pregnancies have caused her breasts to swell to the point where her light pink nipples are clearly visible from under her feathers, with the hint of areolae, and her hips have widened even further in anticipation of even more eggs, the outline of her pussy tantalizingly there-but-not-there under her feathers.";

Happier now and her feathers more colorful, especially near her wingtips, the faint maternal humming of Nadia's wordless singing often accompanies her wherever she goes.";

Noticing you approach, she looks up and gives you a small smile, then turns back to her reading. She's certainly getting more used to having talons instead of fingers.";

In addition to her feathers, she's kept her shoulder-length hair, a deep, vivid crimson that she keeps tied up with a red ribbon.

Being already pregnant, she doesn't sing her mating song, but instead coos and chirps deliriously, her mind fogged by the thought of more eggs growing within her.";
				say "     Taking things slowly, you kneel by Nadia's side and let your hands roam all over her curvaceous form, marveling at her brilliant, colorful beauty and how excellently she's adapted to motherhood. Nadia chirps, finding your gentle touch keenly pleasurable as you trace your fingers across her engorged breasts and the warm, fertile garden of her womb, your chicks growing strong and healthy inside her, and the beautiful bird shivers as the palm of your hand runs back and forth across her baby bump, the sheer pleasure that simple motion commands cumulating in a messy outpouring of sexual fluids from her cunt even before you've entered her. You do this a couple more times, Nadia's cries becoming more impassioned with each orgasm that shakes through her body, her usually well-preened feathers absolutely ruined by the slick puddle of femcum she's kneeling in.";

Tears run down her face, but they're not ones of pain as her well-lubricated passage reacts instantly to your presence, a faint sucking sensation gripping your shaft as you're rapidly coaxed to climax whether you like it or not. You don't need that much effort on your part - a thrust here, a grope of her tender breasts there, and with a final clench of her insides she sends you over the edge, blasting your cum into her. Nadia moans at the sensation of being filled even further, her head low between her arms, and climaxes once more before sinking onto her side straight into the mess the both of you've created on the ground.";

Nadia chirps a few notes, looking at you hopefully, then undoes the ribbon in her hair, shaking out her crimson locks.";

Tears well up in her eyes as you continue to fuck her, her body confused at how something it desperately desires can also hurt so much - in a bid to take her mind off the painful part of being bred, you caress her breasts and dig in her feathers for her nipples, finding them easily enough. Teasing them between thumb and finger, you feel them swell and stiffen, Nadia gasping and squirming under you as she feels it too, now whimpering less and groaning more.";

She squawks as she climaxes too, her talons digging into your collarbone, her belly swelling a little with your load. Panting, she lets go of your shoulders and collapses back onto the cushions while you withdraw, patting her bloated womb and marveling at the sensation of your cum within her.";

Whatever it is, it's certainly making your member stiffen and throb as you draw closer - and the expectant look in her eyes grows as she opens her beak and begins to sing, perhaps partly driven by her surfacing avian instincts. Her voice doesn't quite sound like anything you've ever heard before, alluring and mesmerizing, and she reaches up and pulls you down onto her shapely figure and generous breasts, your cock already painfully stiff by the time her song ends.";
			say "     'I've been practicing,' Nadia says with a giggle as you circle her nipples with a finger. 'I'll perfect my mating song, just for you. Now... fill me with plenty of chicks, pretty please? I want... I need to feel their lives growing within me...'";

Not too big, not too small, but just right. Not to be outdone, she seeks to impale herself upon you as hard as you've thrust into her, and you return in kind, the two of you going harder and faster until Nadia is whimpering and chirping, her breeding instincts taking over as she oozes femcum all over your groin. Her shapely, firm breasts bounce against her chest as you pound her repeatedly, and you find yourself wondering what it would be like if they were nice and full of milk... and her womb full of eggs, just like she wanted.";
			say "     'Harder!' she gasps between moans and squawks. 'Please, harder!' You do your best to fulfill her request, feeling her pulsing walls against your throbbing cock. Nadia is the first to orgasm, squirming under you and flapping her wings against empty air, and you follow suit soon after, firing off burst after burst of seed into her.";
			say "     Nadia's scent of arousal still lingers in the air, but is starting to return to her usual faint floral aroma as the two of you separate reluctantly and lie awhile in her nest to recover. Murmuring and crooning, the broody bird cradles the swell of her belly, bloated with your seed, then drapes her colorful wings about the both of you as she snuggles in close to sleep.";

Even from where you stand, you can see that her nipples are swelling and the feathers about her crotch are rapidly turning from damp to drenched with femcum as her body agrees with her, her nether folds growing swollen and dripping in anticipation of being bred. Nadia steps up to your side, her motherly hips swaying in sync with her long hair and tail-feathers, and leans her body against yours.";
			say "     'It's been too long since I've last felt full,' she croons, rubbing her flat stomach. The heady, floral scent of her arousal is overwhelming. 'Far too long. You shouldn't let your garden go unused for too long, you know. Plant some chicks in me, now... please...'";

			say "     No words are needed after that. Nadia has perfected her mating song - your ears swear they hadn't heard the same thing your mind says it has, but the effect it has on your cock is unmistakable. It's a little hard to think straight with Nadia's unearthly, mesmerizing soprano voice echoing in against the corners of the little world she's carved out in the library, but her talons on your cock are enough to guide you back to her nest. There, she finally lets the song fade and leans back against a pile of cushions with her wings half-folded, and spreads her legs, looking up at you with her beak open in anticipation.";
			say "     And so you indulge her. Nadia's warm, impossibly elastic walls clench tight about your cock as you enter her, cradling it within their depths and giving you a good taste of the warm comfort your offspring grow in. Throbbing and pulsing, they milk your member expertly, seeking to wrest from you every drop of seed you're good for. The beautiful, broody bird cries out as you pound her eagerly, her moaning turning into animal chirping and squawking as her more avian instincts surface in her passion. At last, she can hardly take any more of the exquisite sensations and cries out once more in orgasm, femcum oozing out onto the base of your shaft, her insides clenching tight as you too come and paint her insides with your load. A strange but incredibly pleasurable feeling comes over your cock as Nadia's insides work away, scooping up every last drop of your fertile seed and bringing it to her womb to be planted.";

She stands there, eyes growing glassy as instincts awaken and gears turn in her mind, then reluctantly, she steps out of her nest to melt against you, her feathers tickling yours as she explores your body with her own, testing your muscles as they flex under your skin, her body eagerly telling her that you would make for prime breeding in your new shape. This goes on for a moment, Nadia's body getting perceptibly hotter under her feathers, until she looks up at you, consumed by worshipful adoration.";

'Oh, hello. It's a little musty in here - why don't we go outside for a little while? Get some fresh air? We won't go very far, I promise.'

The ensuing chase is short and exhilarating - Nadia barely manages to retain her lead, ducking and swerving through the air, her broad colorful wings keeping her aloft and ahead but not by so much that you can't eventually catch her. Inadvertently or otherwise, you catch the occasional hint of her tantalizing cunt, and it makes your victory all the more sweeter when you catch her mid-flight and force her down onto the roof of one of the skyscrapers in the high-rise district.";
		say "     Nadia sings sweetly as she lands softly on the concrete roof, her blood pumping and heart hammering as she squirms under you, belly-down. The notes of her mating song carry out into the air and you spread your wings, catching the winds as you spread Nadia's legs and ram yourself into her. It's cold so high up even with your feathers keeping you warm, but Nadia is so warm and gooey inside that you find yourself thrusting as deep as you can into her feminine depths, her body more than eager to accept your virile presence within her. The broody bird struggles to finish her mating song, but her notes steadily turn to incomprehensible squawks and squeals as she revels in being bred, the chase only having served to arouse her even further. She whimpers excitedly as you rough her up a little to work off the heat of the chase, pulling her head and torso back by her lustrous hair and kneading her breasts one at a time. Dribbles of milk ooze from her teats even when she's not pregnant, staining the ground underneath her, joining the puddle of sexual fluids that's oozing from around your shaft and dripping from her body.";

The heat of the chase has soundly worked its way into the base of your shaft and it explodes into Nadia, her cunt clenching tight to ensure that not one drop is wasted when it could go towards growing another child in her. Moaning and chirping, she pushes herself off the ground with her hands, perhaps vaguely aware of the fact that she should be back in her nest to brood and lay the life that's no doubt taken root inside her, but falls back with a whimper. You gently coax Nadia into your embrace, reassuring the broody bird that you'll protect her out here and that nothing will happen to her nest and brood while she's away and also taking the opportunity to suck at her nipples.";

With the way her eyes are glinting and her breath quickening, it's not hard to see that she's finding your avian form quite attractive, but at the same time she's getting a little too gravid to be cavorting around the city. At last, the impasse is broken by a kick from within Nadia's pregnant belly, making her smile. Seems like someone's called the tiebreaker vote.";

Nadia's breath comes in quick, deep gouts as she inhales your scent, her pulse quickening beneath her skin and most prominent about her womb. Her own scent deepens, becoming thick with arousal, and your swelling, throbbing meat brushes against the inside of her thighs, causing her to whimper with arousal. It's a little while before she has enough sense to form words again, 'but I think something can be arranged.'";

Getting her up the ladder and through the hatch to the roof is a little tricky but not impossible, and when she's finally lying out in the open - tired, heat-flushed and swollen with eggs - that your colorful, broody bird looks so delectably vulnerable and unable to resist you if you took her right now, not that she would try, anyway.";

Nadia cheeps plaintively as her maternal instincts kick in strongly, trying to cuddle you the same way she would one of her own brood. Nevertheless, you keep her stretched out on her side as you suckle, a constant reminder of who's who here. Nadia's milk is warm and delicious, with a rich aftertaste - it's not hard to see why all her chicks grow so strong and healthy. There's a lot of it and you drink your fill, Nadia herself an endless fount of life. When you're finally done, you wipe your beak in her generous cleavage, and gently cup her breasts in your hands, feeling them churn and throb as they rapidly refill. It's no surprise that Nadia's breasts end up a little bigger than they were before, her constantly adapting body changing itself to better suit her role as a mother.";

Nadia looks a little pouty at the idea of perfectly good seed being wasted, but you pat her on the head and tell her you'll pull out beforehand and fill her up properly before finishing. That simple promise breaks any inhibitions the broody bird has, and she eagerly stuffs as much of your length as she can into her beak - it's a little rough, but she doesn't have teeth and the workings of her tongue more than makes up for it. Nadia leans back with the effort of sucking you off, her eyes closed in wonder and concentration, and it's only when you feel your balls beginning to churn that you pull out, strings of precum glistening as they fall away from Nadia's beak. There's barely enough time to tip her forward onto all fours and ram your pulsating shaft into her from behind before you blast into her, great gouts of seed entering her already filled womb and swelling it a little further. Her wings beat at the air as she finally orgasms with a squawk, the familiar, rhythmic contractions of her slick tunnel making sure no drop of your cum is wasted.";
		say "     Nadia doesn't want to let go of you at first, savoring the all too brief sensation of you inside her, but eventually relents and snuggles up to your side, rubbing the swell of her belly eagerly. Hopefully, this'll mean another chick will start growing inside her...if it makes her all the more pliable to doing this again, all the better.";

Instead of resolving a Bird Troubles:
	say "     The science faculty of Fairhaven College, once a place that churned out graduates for local organizations like Trevor Labs and the City Hospital, now lie largely abandoned since the outbreak. The teaching laboratories occupy one block near the back of the building, and it's there you find yourself as you wander the campus, examining a couple of trucks parked by a loading dock. The trucks are empty, long looted of anything that might have been valuable, but what catches your attention is a potential entrance into the faculty building by way of a number of shutters and doors set into the rear of the loading dock.";
	say "     These must be the back entrances to the labs, though which bulky materiel is loaded. Perhaps there's something useful remaining inside - after all, the city has been full of surprises so far. Most of the loading bays are shuttered and locked, but there's a door in the back which has been blocked by a fallen length of thick steel piping that's caught between two others to form a bar of sorts, wedging shut the outward-opening door. It's thick, riddled with claw marks and slightly bent, but isn't too heavy to lift and you're in before too long.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Behind the door is a long corridor doors leading to individual laboratories on either side, a draft carrying air in from the small windows set high into the walls. Looking through the glass windows separating them from the corridors proper, most of the specimens have died from thirst and starvation in the cages, an unhappy end even for lab animals. Yet in one of them, the cages have been thrown open - not forced, but thrown - and there's someone collapsed on the ground inside! Carefully, you ease open the door and peer inside, holding your breath.";
	say "     Face-down on the ground is a bird-woman, her figure thin and scrawny, her hands and feet now talons. Her feathers are a dull, muted shade of various colors, her crimson hair is messy and unkempt, and her tail-feathers are long and sweeping, reaching down to her calves. The wings that jut from between her shoulder blades are bent at entirely unnatural angles, much like pictures of pigeon roadkill you've seen. Perhaps in a different time and place she could have been truly beautiful, but right now that beauty is just broken, not unlike a cracked mirror.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Roused by your footsteps as you approach, she raises her head and scrambles to her feet, whimpering and shielding herself with her hands until she realizes you're not a threat - and you're equally relieved that she isn't one, either.";
	say "     'Someone came,' the bird-woman says, slumping her shoulders. 'Someone finally came. Who knows how long I spent trying to break down that door, that and the front entrance - I was beginning to wonder if this was how I would die, trapped and alone...I watched the animals die one by one from hunger in their cages, but I didn't dare to let them go...wondering if I would end up like them...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Well, at least she's not going to be dying now. You ask for her name, and she nods. 'My name is Nadia. I'm...' she looks down at her talons, seeming fit to burst into tears at any time. '...I was a student here. Are those things still out there? I've lost count of how many days I've spent trapped in these laboratories.";
	say "     'Do you have somewhere I could go?' she asks hopefully. 'I...I can't stay here anymore, and I don't think there's anywhere that's safe on campus, not after hearing some of the noises that go on outside all day and night.'";

		say "     'I didn't want to go to college - didn't see the value in it when there aren't really any classes on how to be a wife and mother. What I wanted to do was to raise a family, then maybe later there would be time for everything else, but everyone pressured me to go, said I had no ambition, that I shouldn't...' she chokes back tears. 'I eventually gave in when my mother told me I could earn my Mrs. degree while studying as well, and I'd hoped that picking out education would let me work with children when I graduated.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'When all this started, I was passing by the science faculty on the way to class - most of the professors and my classmates had turned into horrid furry things and Greeks or something, and while one of them took my clothes, they didn't manage to take me. After that, I didn't dare make a run for the dorms, nor did I dare shout for help, so I holed up in a cluster of the natural sciences labs. I didn't expect the door to get blocked like that while I was inside, I'd finished all the snacks the lab techs left in their offices, and I was so hungry, so...'";
		say "     It's a while until she gets over her embarrassment. 'There were a couple of exotic birds on loan from the zoo, you see. They were too pretty for me to let them just die, and they were so friendly, never tried to bite or claw me or anything, unlike some of the other animals. There was a whole bunch of juicy fruit in one of the freezers for them, so I fed them and kept them alive while trapped in there. The fruit was clearly marked as not for people, but there wasn't anything left, so...' she ruffles her feathers. 'I ended up like this, and I keep on getting these strange urges, like I need to... um... anyways, I opened their cages shortly before you found me. The window was too small for me to fit through, but at least they're free now.'";

Drawn by some invisible force, she heads upstairs with you following, and after looking about the library's second floor, begins pulling cushions off the sofa and arranging them in a circular pattern on an empty spot on the floor. You watch her for a few moments before finally realizing that she's building a nest thanks to her avian instincts, a suspicion that's confirmed by her flopping straight into the middle of the small pile and nestling down with no small satisfaction.";
		say "     'Thank you for letting me stay here,' she chirps. 'It's the first time since this mess started that anything's happened to give me hope. I was watching, waiting for so long, afraid to call for help yet desperately hoping someone would come before I died... and you did. Again, thank you so much.'";

				say "     Her reason for doing so soon becomes clear. Settling down in a large country house with a fellow avian mutant who's far more willing to indulge her breeding and nesting urges than you were, Nadia proceeds to pop out a steady stream of children over the coming years. Her ever-growing brood spreads out across the countryside, reclaiming and working much of the damaged land left in the wake of the nanite outbreak and putting it to good use. Mutants willing to put in a honest day's work are afforded food and shelter at any one of her many offspring's farms, and this saves a good number of them from starvation in the lean times that follow the outbreak.";
				say "     The two of you still keep in touch, and she invites you over for dinner every so often, referring to the grand country home she and her husband have restored as her 'nest', a distinct improvement from the ring of cushions and furniture she'd occupied back at the library. It's at one of these dinners that you look at Nadia - with her body filled out and motherly from repeated pregnancies and with more on the way, surrounded by those she loves and who love her - and can't help but agree she was right to hold out hope till the end.";

					say "     Nadia's vocal talents draws much interest amongst lovers of the classical scene. While her tendency to be constantly pregnant limits the scope of her public performances, many drop by for a private one, or even just to hear her sing lullabies to her chicks.";
					say "     Although Nadia's often willing to sing to calm others, she reserves the soft, arousing tones of her mating song only for you. Her body gradually adapts itself more fully to motherhood, growing more beautiful with each egg laid, and this only pleases the crowds more, paying great sums to have the exquisite bird sing for them. Yet at the height of her fame, Nadia chooses to quit the scene and settle down with you more firmly and concentrate on growing her brood. Her loss is keenly felt by the community of classical singers, but in the end they agree it's her decision to do so.";

The latter proves to be highly popular with mutants who wish to hide their musks and heats, avoiding social upsets and aiding in one's concentration, and there is no shortage of prospective customers. Rumors abound that she reserves the best of her perfume recipes for her own personal use, but no one has ever actually seen her using any, even though her signature floral scent is unmistakable the moment she steps into the room.";
					say "     However, Nadia's greatest love is always for her brood. Once the business is off the ground, Nadia leaves its day-to-day running to her children, and instead focuses her effort on giving them more brothers and sisters. You, on your part, are more than willing to regularly plant your seed within the fertile confines of her womb and keep her well-stuffed with plenty of eggs, ensuring that she will never have to feel empty inside ever again.";

Her impressively fertile and motherly features draw comment from some of the soldiers, clearly awestruck by the sheer vibrancy of her colorful beauty, but she makes it clear she's only going to be breeding with you.";
					say "     In the days to come, Nadia's passion for children overflows, the passing of the immediate danger seeming to stoke her breeding and nesting urges even more. She's ever quick to remind you to keep her pregnant and fruitful, and she puts her education to good use in wrangling both her massive brood and young students. When not teaching classes, attending to daily chores or otherwise occupied, the beautiful, broody bird simply lies about much most of the time with her talons caressing her belly, delighting in the sheer sensation of being filled to the absolute brim with growing lives.";
					say "     On their part, Nadia's flock of children travel outward from her nest and across the country, caring for the lost, orphaned and abandoned and bringing them a small portion of their mother's love and hope. Their efforts make them well-recognized in some parts of the country, and help save many from despair in the dark times that immediately follow the outbreak.";

Her impressively maternal and fecund body draws comment from some of the soldiers when they're not kept busy with taking stock of her numerous children, but she makes it clear she only has eyes for you. It doesn't help that some of the more unhinged survivors seem to think of her as some kind of goddess, causing quite a bit of embarrassment for her before the two of you are finally cleared.";
					say "     In the days to come, Nadia simply concentrates on being a good mate to you, and an equally excellent mother to her ever-growing brood - a full time job, to be sure. Ensuring that you always keep her filled and happy with eggs, the broody bird's infectious aura of hope and happiness prevails wherever you go, and you never want for a coffee and hot meal in the morning prepared by your fertile goddess's hands. Nadia's body only continues to grow more bountiful with each birth - her generous features make her quite the envy of some other mutants, but she takes it all in her innocent good humor. Nadia takes up a bit of gardening on the side, too, and it seems that everything she tends to, be it fruit, veggies or flowers, seems to grow exceptionally well. Word gets about that she can make flowers grow on barren earth just by having walked across it, but she laughs off the rumors as just that.";
					say "     In time, Nadia's numerous children fan out across the country, helping other mutants cope with their changes and spreading their mother's love and warmth to others. There's always at least one or two of them visiting at any given time, and the gifts they keep on sending back are more than enough for you to live off on if you so desired.";

Nadia ends here.
