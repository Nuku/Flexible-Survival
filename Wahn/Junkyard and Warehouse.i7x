storage room	"storage room"

The storage room is a room. "The inside of this warehouse has been converted into a shelter. The large stockpile of packaging and spare parts remains in the center of the room, a remnant of the city's industry. More heavily guarded are the stockpiles of bottled water in the corner. A line of survivors stretches from the water all the way around the wall. Few of them carry any possessions; they sit on blankets as they talk to one another. Every now and then, a glint of color or a patch of fur catches your eye; it seems at least a few of these survivors have already been mutated, and are desperately trying to hide it.";

Storage Room is south of the Warehouse Door.

A door leads back to the warehouse floor.";

You have to gulp it down just to avoid drowning, but you can't help yourself as you push your mouth further down his shaft, watching as the fur along his body spreads faster as you get further down. Soon he's neighing out of a slender equine muzzle, his newly thickened fingers gripping at your head to force you down to the base. As you gulp around the tip of the shaft, you feel it edging its way deeper inside you. The length slows in its growth, but is still quite eager to get even larger within you.

It also doesn't take long for the new twinks to start running their hands over each other, the ropes and bindings torn off them when they'd been stripped by their stallion.
