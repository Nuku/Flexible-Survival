You feel yourself moaning submissively, as he runs his hooves over your body teasingly, even as he settles himself between your legs, the feeling of his thick cock rubbing up against your crotch making you feel even more submissive as you spread your legs wider for him.";

You try to protest, only to find yourself bleating just like a ewe as he sheathes himself in you in one swift move, the feel of his thick cock pressing into your body making your mind explode with pleasure.  As the powerful ram thrusts into you again and again, you can feel your protests fading, and you can feel your dominant urges fading with each thrust, replaced by feelings of happy submission to your ram.  With the intense pleasure of his cock stroking your insides, you can't help but embrace your new instincts, and you pant eagerly as you begin to clutch the powerful ram to your body tightly.";
		say "     Happy at this newest evidence of his complete victory over your body, the Ram lets out a triumphant cry as he shoots his seed into you, making you moan happily in response. After a minute of lying there with his cock still twitching inside you, the ram pulls himself out of your body, making you blink as you look up at the powerful beast.  Standing up the ram grins down at you, 'Now that you know what it's like to be a proper ewe, I expect you will come running next time I call.' He says teasingly as you nod absently. 'I need to go find a few more members for the flock, so once you are a proper ewe, be sure to hunt me down, that's an order from your new Ram.' He says with amusement as he turns and jogs off into the city. Leaving you lying there on the ground, your mind still fogged with submissive bliss, a strong desire to obey and do just what your ram ordered welling up within you, even as you try to hold on to your remaining humanity.[impregchance]";

You groan in defeat as he shoots his sticky seed all over your body, marking you as his.";
		say "     'Ah that was good,' The ram says happily as he rubs his cock some more.  'Almost nothing feels as good as defeating a trespasser in my territory.'  The ram says as he gets off you, before turning to depart, leaving you to contend with the mess he left in his wake.";

Unfortunately you aren't alone in the city and are beset on all sides by different predators and infected until finally you and your small flock are captured by a group of hyenas.  At first it is somewhat disconcerting to be surrounded by predators, but soon you realize it isn't all bad.  As the only male you are indispensable to them, and you are kept in some comfort, your only duty is to breed the Ewes all day and relax.

Taking advantage of your increased strength, the two of you head out into the city together, your dimly recalled familiarity with the city, as well as Mary's expertise in scavenging serving you well as you look for a safe location to set up.  Eventually finding a suitable spot, the two of you set out to trap yourselves a nice ram or two for you both to share.  It isn't long before you have one of those rams wandering around without a flock trussed up and protesting in your new hideout, the two of you easily able to overpower his surprised form.  His protesting stops quickly however, when he realizes that the two of you need a nice male like him for your flock, and he resolves to do his duty eagerly.  He is somewhat surprised to find himself relegated to the role of a breeding stud, the two of you visiting him whenever the urge strikes you, and ignoring him otherwise. Your strength protecting the small flock instead of his, while Mary's smarts helps your small group survive in the dangerous city, while he warms both of your beds at night. Your lust fogged mind is happy to have found such a lovely flock to be a part of, as you cuddle happily up against Mary the two of you spending plenty of lustful time together without your new ram, even as she makes plans for the soldiers which are sure to come soon... and you feel a smile stretching your sheep-like muzzle as you realize your flock will probably be growing larger very soon indeed.";

You decide to settle down and raise a larger flock eventually, opening a small clothing and fabric store before settling down to breed some new young lambs.  The demand for your hand-spun clothing and well-made designs quickly outstrips your ability to keep up, and so you find yourself hiring on a few other young women to help, who eventually join the flock eagerly after a gift of some of your [']specially treated['] wool garments.

At Mary's urging, you both head out into the country, where you can start a small sheep farm of your own, both of you agreeing that at least having some fellow sheep around should be rather comforting to your changed senses.  When your flock arrives, the two of you feel much better immediately, and you discover the other sheep follow you around without protest when you lead them places, making your job much easier than normal.  You find one of the rams eyeing you and Mary rather often however, and are almost unsurprised to return home one day to find Mary bleating away happily underneath him. The sight is strangely arousing, as he finishes mating her, and she blushingly explains that her season crept up on her, and he was just so tempting and right there... Letting her know you aren't upset, she smiles happily, before teasingly reminding you that your own season will be coming soon. Blushing in surprise, you look at the handsome ram nosing around your flock member, and much to Mary's amusement, you let her know that you can hardly wait...";

However when you arrive and walk in, Leon and several other members of the flock pounce on you eagerly, the ewes holding you down for your dominant ram, as he makes sure to breed you again and again. Your urge to struggle fades, as he inducts you into the flock like a proper ewe, mating you again and again like the beasts you both are, your bleating calls of pleasure filling the store, even as the musky aroma of your flock surrounds you. When Leon is finally done claiming you as his own, you can hardly remember why you would have wanted to protest belonging to your handsome ram, your will overcome by your new urges, and the powerful males pheromones. You feel a silly smile spreading across your muzzle as the rest of the flock hug and stroke your more powerful body, making you feel nice and welcome as they help you settle in to your new home. Fitting in is surprisingly easy, as is just letting your powerful ram and the rest of the flock do your thinking for you, and your larger size and muscles ensure you a lovely position underneath your new master more often than not.

You enjoy having the formerly dominant male pinned underneath you, while the rest of his flock watches your struggle with increasing arousal. Finally Leon is forced to admit defeat, as you hold him down and tease his all to pliable body until he submits. As your new flock gathers happily around their new leader, their cheers and the soft strokes of their hoof-like hands making you feel strong and powerful, you proceed to celebrate your position by making Leon drink your masculine seed time and time again. Soon the former ram is just as female and needy as any of your other ewes, a change you help her celebrate by filling her with your offspring right away.  You enjoy several long nights of bestial mating, as you claim the entire flock one by one, ensuring their loyalty to their new ram and master. Settling in to the store is easy enough, and quite enjoyable to your instinct driven mind, your ewes taking good care of you, while you make sure they are all nice and well bred, though you single out two of them as your special favorites.

[one of]Being far too late to find any unclaimed people to transform, you wander aimlessly, your mind growing increasingly more feral and bestial until you submit completely to your instincts.  Eventually when the military come you are rescued, however there is little hope for them to rehabilitate someone as far gone mentally as you are, and so you end up spending much of your time locked up on the base, though occasionally some of the scientists, or female soldiers will sneak into your cell to enjoy the kinds of pleasures only a true ram can give them...[or]Finding it hard to put together a flock of your own at this point, you end up challenging many of the other rams wandering the city, trying to prove your dominance and take their flocks.  After several near fights, you eventually manage to win yourself a small flock, which you lead proudly, fending off attacks by other rams, and doing your best to avoid the more predatory beasts at the same time.  You lie low when the military assault the city, and you and your flock come out again once they have been driven back. Gathering up the remnants of the less intelligent flocks which were scattered by the assault, you soon have the largest and most powerful flock around, and happily claim yourself a nice piece of grazing land near the park.  While you still lose the occasional sheep to the predators, as the flock leader you lead a happy and prosperous life, your only job to ensure that the rest of the sheep are well bred and filled with your seed... a job you enjoy heartily.[at random]";

The male beast is surprised at your eager bodies response to finally finding a more powerful and dominant male, as you moan and rub against them teasingly. Seemingly amused, the male predator wastes no time in giving you what your body so desperately needs, his exotic cock causing your mind to explode in pleasure as he breeds you again and again throughout the night. Eventually when he moves to leave, you find yourself following him along eagerly, much to his amusement, the predatory male taking you back to his den, where he breeds you again several more times, as you bleat submissively underneath him, happy to finally have found a properly dominant male to submit to.  You adapt to your new life as his predatory plaything with surprising ease, and before long you have his lovely babies on the way, and you just can't help but look forward to taking care of them for him.";

Once there, you waste no time in convincing the all too pliable female nurses to clear you for release, teasing them with your ram-like musk, and making them promise to follow after you as soon as they can. Grinning you head out into the world eagerly, already planning out the best way to acquire a nice flock to play with, and the best way to make a living. You eventually find yourself in one of the major cities, making some contacts, and working for minimum wage, under a lazy and abusive male supervisor, which is an offense to your Ram like dignity. When one of the nurses finally shows up, you waste no time in teasing and playing with her, enjoying how she begs and pleads for you to change her and make her your ewe. Once you finally give in and finish changing her, you have an amusing idea, which your new ewe eagerly goes along with, luring your offensive supervisor out with tempting glimpses of her changed body. When he is fully distracted and in your apartment, you strike, your ewe eagerly holding him down while you make a lovely new ewe for your flock, with your two first flock members by your side, it is easy enough to acquire several more. Soon you quit your old job entirely, and are able to relax in style, having your new ewes work for you, or often enough renting your shapely flock members out to curious people for a night or two of mind blowing sex, and some of those who come back often enough end up finding out just how mind-blowing the sex can be as a female ewe as well.

Feeling somewhat aggressive, you end up challenging several of the soldiers to wrestling matches, which your new form lets you win handily. Flush with victory, you end up offering to have some fun with some of the recently defeated soldiers, an offer they heartily accept.  Several hours and one amazing orgy later, you and a group of rather embarrassed looking new rams will emerge from the barracks, much to the amusement of their fellow squadmates. Your new friends will call in several favors in order to sneak themselves and you out of the camp without anyone else noticing, which leads you all piling in for a road trip to the nearest soldiers house.  Several hours spent in the car with their masculine musk nearly drives you crazy, and your female scent is equally distracting to your new mates, and when you eventually arrive at the house, you are barely through the door before sheep-like bodies are rubbing up against each other again. After several days of near constant rutting, you finally feel somewhat satiated, and start to think clearly again, and though you still enjoy the approving looks of your mates as they stroke your soft fleece, your burning need is mostly sated. Once they introduce themselves, you begin planning your next steps, all of the males amusingly enough bowing to your dominance as you go over who they know who might make good additions to your small flock, as well as family members they think would benefit from your new changes. Soon you are on a new road trip together, your new rams making several phone calls to get people ready, while you head out to gather up  your soon to be flock members before you can all find someplace safe to settle down together, a smile stretching your muzzle as you look forward to how much fun you and your new flock are going to have together.";
