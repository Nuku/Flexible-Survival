[ Use To say for overlong behaviours that would make the table difficult to read and understand. Typically needed if there are alot of cock/species/cunt checks. ] 
ramconsent is a number that varies.

to say ram attack:
	if cocks of player is greater than 0:
		say "Knocking you to the ground one last time, the large ram grins lewdly as he runs his eyes over your defeated form, his grin going even wider as his eyes fall upon your limp cock. 'You won[apostrophe]t be needing that anymore,' The beast says as he pushes you down to the ground roughly, pinning you there as he pumps his own cock eagerly. You groan in defeat as he shoots his sticky seed all over your body, marking you as his.  'Ah that was good,' The ram says happily as he rubs his cock some more, 'Almost nothing feels as good as defeating another male in my territory.' The ram says as he gets off you, before grinning evilly as he looks down at your helpless form. 'Except for fucking a former male that thought they could wander into my territory,' He says with a chuckle. 'Now once your done transforming into a proper ewe for me, you come find me right away, that's an order from your Ram.' The powerful ram says, before chuckling as he heads back into the city, leaving you lying there covered in his seed, and with a surprisingly strong desire to hunt him down again, just like he told you to...";
	otherwise:
		say "Knocking you to the ground, the powerful male grins as he stands over your defeated form, 'And now to claim you as part of my flock,' He says teasingly, as he pushes your legs apart with one of his rough hooflike hands, his touch making you shudder slightly, as his masculine musk fills your head, causing your pussy to moisten eagerly. You feel yourself moaning submissively, as he runs his hooves over your body teasingly, even as he settles himself between your legs, the feeling of his thick cock rubbing up against your crotch making you feel even more submissive as you spread your legs wider for him. 'Now thats a good eager little ewe,' The ram mutters smugly, as he enjoys your bodies automatic response to his dominant scent and actions. You try to protest, only to find yourself bleating just like a ewe as he sheathes himself in you in one swift move, the feel of his thick cock pressing into your body making your mind explode with pleasure.  As the powerful ram thrusts into you again and again, you can feel your protests fading, and you can feel your dominant urges fading with each thrust, replaced by feelings of happy submission to your ram.  With the intense pleasure of his cock stroking your insides, you cant help but embrace your new instincts, and you pant eagerly as you begin to clutch the powerful ram to your body tightly.  Happy at this newest evidence of his complete victory over your body, the Ram lets out a triumphant cry as he shoots his seed into you, making you moan happily in response. After a minute of lying there with his cock still twitching inside you, the ram pulls himself out of your body, making you blink as you look up at the powerful beast.  Standing up the ram grins down at you, 'Now that you know what it[apostrophe]s like to be a proper ewe, I expect you will come running next time I call.' He says teasingly as you nod absently. 'I need to go find a few more members for the flock, so once you are a proper you, be sure to hunt me down, thats an order from your new Ram.' He says with amusement as he turns and jogs off into the city. Leaving you lying there on the ground, your mind still fogged with submissive bliss, a strong desire to obey and do just what your ram ordered welling up within you, even as you try to hold on to your remaining humanity.[impregchance]";

To say ram loss:
	say "The male ram groans as you knock him to the ground viciously, the beast staring up at you fearfully as he signals his defeat. When you shift your weight as if to move closer, the formerly brave beast panics and scrambles away awkwardly, making you chuckle at the sight as he disappears back into the city.";

You quickly set about finding more members to convert to your flock, increasing your numbers for a time and protecting the trail of Ewes following you. Unfortunately you aren't alone in the city and are beset on all sides by different predators and infected until finally you and your small flock are captured by a group of hyenas.  At first it is somewhat disconcerting to be surrounded by predators, but soon you realize it isn't all bad.  As the only male you are indispensable to them, and you are kept in some comfort, your only duty is to breed the Ewes all day and relax.

Without the makings of a real ram, you aren[apostrophe]t quite able to form a flock of your own  with your friendly little ewe, fortunately though, Mary has a plan for you both.  Taking advantage of your increased strength, the two of you head out into the city together, your dimly recalled familiarity with the city, as well as Mary[apostrophe]s expertise in scavenging serving you well as you look for a safe location to set up.  Eventually finding a suitable spot, the two of you set out to trap yourselves a nice ram or two for you both to share.  It isn[apostrophe]t long before you have one of those rams wandering around without a flock trussed up and protesting in your new hideout, the two of you easily able to overpower his surprised form.  His protesting stops quickly however, when he realizes that the two of you need a nice male like him for your flock, and he resolves to do his duty eagerly.  He is somewhat surprised to find himself relegated to the role of a breeding stud, the two of you visiting him whenever the urge strikes you, and ignoring him otherwise. Your strength protecting the small flock instead of his, while Mary[apostrophe]s smarts helps your small group survive in the dangerous city, while he warms both of your beds at night.

You decide to settle down and raise a larger flock eventually, opening a small clothing and fabric store before settling down to breed some new young lambs.  The demand for your hand-spun clothing and well-made designs quickly outstrips your ability to keep up, and so you find yourself hiring on a few other young women to help, who eventually join the flock eagerly after a gift of some of your 'specially treated' wool garments. You soon enough have a rather brisk business going, and a small but ever increasing flock to take care of you.

At Mary[apostrophe]s urging, you both head out into the country, where you can start a small sheep farm of your own, both of you agreeing that at least having some fellow sheep around should be rather comforting to your changed senses.  When your flock arrives, the two of you feel much better immediately, and you discover the other sheep follow you around without protest when you lead them places, making your job much easier then normal.  You find one of the rams eyeing you and Mary rather often however, and are almost unsurprised to return home one day to find Mary bleating away happily underneath him. The sight is strangely arousing, as he finishes mating her, and she blushingly explains that her season crept up on her, and he was just so tempting and right there... Letting her know you aren[apostrophe]t upset, she smiles happily, before teasingly reminding you that your own season will be coming soon. Blushing in surprise, you look at the handsome ram nosing around your flock member, and much to Mary[apostrophe]s amusement, you let her know that you can hardly wait....";

However when you arrive and walk in, Leon and several other members of the flock pounce on you eagerly, the ewes holding you down for your dominant ram, as he makes sure to breed you again and again. Your urge to struggle fades, as he inducts you into the flock like a proper ewe, mating you again and again like the beasts you both are, your bleating calls of pleasure filling the store, even as the musky aroma of your flock surrounds you. When Leon is finally done claiming you as his own, you can hardly remember why you would have wanted to protest belonging to your handsome ram, your will overcome by your new urges, and the powerful males pheromones. You feel a silly smile spreading across your muzzle as the rest of the flock hug and stroke your more powerful body, making you feel nice and welcome as they help you settle in to your new home. Fitting in is surprisingly easy, as is just letting your powerful ram and the rest of the flock do your thinking for you, and your larger size and muscles ensure you a lovely position underneath your new master more often then not. Soon your belly is swelling pleasantly with the promise of new life, and your lust filled sheep like mind, can think of little that will be better then presenting your powerful male with lovely little baby sheep for his flock, and then having him fill you up with even more of them...";

You grin as you sneak up on the nervous Leon, before finally leaping on the flock leader and wrestling him to the ground. You enjoy having the formerly dominant male pinned underneath you, while the rest of his flock watches your struggle with increasing arousal. Finally Leon is forced to admit defeat, as you hold him down and tease his all to pliable body until he submits. As your new flock gathers happily around their new leader, their cheers and the soft strokes of their hoof-like hands making you feel strong and powerful, you proceed to celebrate your position  by making Leon drink your masculine seed time and time again. Soon the former ram is just as female and needy as any of your other ewes, a change you help her celebrate by filling her with your offspring right away.  You enjoy several long nights of beastial mating, as you claim the entire flock one by one, ensuring their loyalty to their new ram and master. Settling in to the store is easy enough, and quite enjoyable to your instinct driven mind, your ewes taking good care of you, while you make sure they are all nice and well bred, though you single out two of them as your special favorites. Both Mary, and the formerly male Leon, share your bed every night, often with another flock member of two, and you enjoy watching them grow increasingly more submissive as their bellies grow round with proof of your ram-like virility.  Eventually the Military come through the city, and your flock sells some of the soldiers some basic equipment and items, and even arranges for some basic resupply from outside the city to fill the shelves back up again. While the soldiers suggest you should probably evacuate several times, you can only grin at them in amusement, more then happy with your new life here in the changed city. A viewpoint you share with some of the most promising soldiers, adding them to your flock when they won[apostrophe]t be missed, your flock growing slowly and steadily, and becoming the largest flock in the city, giving you quite a bit of bargaining power when the military are finally forced to come to the bargaining table....";

The flock settles into their new life with surprising ease, taking up several jobs in town, as well as starting up a small ranch of their own nearby, and you are happily in the middle of it all. Your more powerful form, as well as your still sharp mind, quickly making you Leon[apostrophe]s favorite, as well as his second in command. You enjoy the challenge of settling any problems with the concerned townspeople or visitors, especially when sometimes the settlement results in a new flock member or two, and coming home to the warm arms of your ram every night is a wonderful feeling as well. Looking around at your new life, you are hard pressed to think of how things could get any better then this, a grin crossing your muzzle as you look around at your increasingly sheep owned community.";

You make a number of 'close' friends among the ewes as they try testing you for infectiousness, before being forced to give up and let you go so they could focus on events in the city itself. Once free and out of the military[apostrophe]s hands, you and Leon lock horns for a bit over your exact position regarding the flock, since the ewes are very much in love with you both.

Eventually purchasing a large parcel of land, and creating your own small self-sufficient community. With the efforts of two rams, your flock and town begins to grow rather quickly, with the few visitors to your small community often ending up as nice new ewes for one or the other of you to play with. You have several small fights with Leon over the years, but a strange sort of friendship and rivalry develops between you, and keeps you working together through the roughest of times. As you settle down and listen to the latest news on the radio while your large flock gathers around you comfortably like the extended family you have all become, you feel a smile stretching your sheep-like muzzle, as you listen to the news about the complete failure of the military containment, knowing your flock is already ready for the new world that is sure to arrive soon enough.";
