to say ram attack:

		say "Knocking you to the ground one last time, the large ram grins lewdly as he runs his eyes over your defeated form, his grin going even wider as his eyes fall upon your limp cock. 'You won[apostrophe]t be needing that anymore,' The beast says as he pushes you down to the ground roughly, pinning you there as he pumps his own cock eagerly. You groan in defeat as he shoots his sticky seed all over your body, marking you as his.  'Ah that was good,' The ram says happily as he rubs his cock some more, 'Almost nothing feels as good as defeating another male in my territory.' The ram says as he gets off you, before grinning evilly as he looks down at your helpless form. 'Except for fucking a former male that thought they could wander into my territory,' He says with a chuckle. 'Now once your done transforming into a proper ewe for me, you come find me right away, thats an order from your Ram.' The powerful ram says, before chuckling as he heads back into the city, leaving you lying there covered in his seed, and with a surprisingly strong desire to hunt him down again, just like he told you to...";
		infect "ram";
	otherwise:
		say "Knocking you to the ground, the powerful male grins as he stands over your defeated form, 'And now to claim you as part of my flock,' He says teasingly, as he pushes your legs apart with one of his rough hooflike hands, his touch making you shudder slightly, as his masculine musk fills your head, causing your pussy to moisten eagerly. You feel yourself moaning submissively, as he runs his hooves over your body teasingly, even as he settles himself between your legs, the feeling of his thick cock rubbing up against your crotch making you feel even more submissive as you spread your legs wider for him. 'Now thats a good eager little ewe,' The ram mutters smugly, as he enjoys your bodies automatic response to his dominant scent and actions. You try to protest, only to find yourself bleating just like a ewe as he sheathes himself in you in one swift move, the feel of his thick cock pressing into your body making your mind explode with pleasure.  As the powerful ram thrusts into you again and again, you can feel your protests fading, and you can feel your dominant urges fading with each thrust, replaced by feelings of happy submission to your ram.  With the intense pleasure of his cock stroking your insides, you cant help but embrace your new instincts, and you pant eagerly as you begin to clutch the powerful ram to your body tightly.  Happy at this newest evidence of his complete victory over your body, the Ram lets out a triumphant cry as he shoots his seed into you, making you moan happily in response. After a minute of lying there with his cock still twitching inside you, the ram pulls himself out of your body, making you blink as you look up at the powerful beast.  Standing up the ram grins down at you, 'Now that you know what it[apostrophe]s like to be a proper ewe, I expect you will come running next time I call.' He says teasingly as you nod absently. 'I need to go find a few more members for the flock, so once you are a proper you, be sure to hunt me down, thats an order from your new Ram.' He says with amusement as he turns and jogs off into the city. Leaving you lying there on the ground, your mind still fogged with submissive bliss, a strong desire to obey and do just what your ram ordered welling up within you, even as you try to hold on to your remaining humanity.[impregchance]";
		infect "ram";


To say ram loss:
	say "The male ram groans as you knock him to the ground viciously, the beast staring up at you fearfully as he signals his defeat. When you shift your weight as if to move closer, the formerly brave beast panics and scrambles away awkwardly, making you chuckle at the sight as he disappears back into the city.";

"Tainted wool"	"A small bundle of rough wool you found in the city, strangely enough, it has a rather pleasant musky scent coming from it."	1	 Tainted wool

Tainted wool is a grab object. It is part of the player. Understand "patch"  as Tainted wool. Tainted wool is infectious. The strain of Tainted wool is "ram".

The usedesc of Tainted wool is "You take out the small bundle of wool you acquired earlier, and your head swims slightly as your nose fills with its strong musky odor. Feeling a bit aroused by the strange scent, you slowly start to rub the wool up against your cheek in order to enjoy the smell better. The feeling of the soft wool rubbing against your body, as well as the arousing aroma, make you lose track of time for a minute, until you realize you can feel your body starting to change.";

instead of sniffing Tainted wool:
	say "The wool smells of ram musk.";

Finally you can[apostrophe]t take it any longer, and find yourself fleeing back through the city to an all too familiar store. Leon is ready to welcome you with open arms, seemingly unsurprised at your panicked return as he envelops you in his arms. With your flock leaders arms around you, and the scent of your flock filling your head, you finally begin to feel safe again as he strokes you softly. You soon find the thought of straying from your flock makes you increasingly nervous, and realize that your time exploring the city and pretending to be independent is over for good. Your flock leader is there for you to help you settle into your new life as a submissive ewe however, helping you fit into the flock, and keeping him with you most nights. Soon you can[apostrophe]t imagine life without your flock members, or living for any other reason then to serve your handsome ram in any way he wants....[or]Feeling your mind fading, you stumble back to the store and the sense of safety it provides. Making it there safely Leon and the flock take you in and take care of you, letting you sleep curled up amongst the other sheep.  When the rest of the flock is rescued later, they take you with them to their new pasturage, where you can spend the day with the regular uninfected sheep grazing, and the nights in the pen either with Leon or one of the regular rams he buys.

Heading back out into the city, you find yourself looking desperately for someplace to belong, becoming more and more nervous as you wander the predator filled city alone.[one of] Eventually you manage to find yourself a spot to hole up until the military come, and several of the soldiers take pity upon you when they find you huddled pathetically in an empty convenience store. They take you with them, and once you are declared non infectious, they let you hang around their camp with them, where you do your best to make yourself useful. Your sheep-like cock which led to your flock driving you out, proves surprisingly popular among several of the female soldiers, and you become somewhat of a small mascot to your unit.[or]Inevitably, you are found by some of the predators wandering the city, your sheep-like form unable to drive off the more powerful beasts, you end up captured by them all too easily. Taking you back with them, they seem amused at your helpless bleating, and decide to keep you around as you are instead of trying to change you.  You end up as their pet, and quite often the evening amusement as well, as they take care of you, play tricks on you, and even occasionally fuck you.[or]Eventually, you manage to find another survivor of the strange infection sweeping the city, who takes pity on you and takes you back to his own bunker. Your confused mind happy at finding someplace to belong, you settle in easily, grateful and eager to help, he soon begins to open up and trust you more and more as he tries to survive the strange infections sweeping the city.

As the business begins to proper, you feel increasingly proud of yourself, and Leon even acknowledges that you have earned yourself a proper place in the flock. Eventually, he even manages to find you a sheep of your own for you to take care of, the ewe named Mary you helped back in the city.

Eventually you end up settling down as waitresses at a bar together, the novelty of your strange forms only increasing your popularity with the patrons, and making you quite a few tips.  Several times, some of the more curious will hit on one of you, only to be surprised when they find out you both come together as a package, and while you have some wild times together, much to your disappointment, none of them become handsome rams for you, or stay more then a night or two.  Eventually though, a handsome looking [one of]Wolf[or]Bear[or]Lion[or]Tiger[or]Horse[at random] morph wanders into the bar, and takes note of the two of you.

Your sheep-like build is no match for the powerful Ram, as he quickly claims Mary for his own, mating her and making her part of his flock immediately.  He seems amused at your protests however, and allows you to tag along with his flock, and while you try to challenge him several more times, you are finally forced to acknowledge his dominance, and end up staying with his flock and helping the more powerful male in any way he orders you to.
