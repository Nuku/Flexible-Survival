Section 1- Skunk kit

skunk kit is a pet. The description of the skunk kit is "The skunk kit you rescued is obviously the offspring of one of the larger skunk beasts roaming the park, as even as young as it obviously is it is already the size of a regular skunk or perhaps even slightly larger. The creature stares up at you adoringly however, with love in its eyes for its savior, exploring the world around it with the innocence of youth, how long that innocence will last though as it grows is anyone[apostrophe]s guess, but for now its happy skunk-like antics bring a smile to your face". skunk kit is a part of the player;
The weapon damage of skunk kit is 8;
The level of skunk kit is 1;
The Dexterity of skunk kit is 13;
The summondesc of skunk kit is "You call out for the little skunk you rescued to come help you out, and it comes trotting up from where it was following you, ready and eager to assist its friend, the smell of skunk filling the area around you.";
The assault of skunk kit is "[one of]The little skunk viciously launches itself at your attacker![or]Turning around, the skunk sprays your attacker in the face![or]Afraid of being left alone again, the little skunk goes into a frenzy of biting![or]all of a sudden the powerful scent of skunk washes over the fight from where your little skunk kit is playing nearby.[or] taking advantage of your foes distraction, the skunk nips and bites at whatever part of your opponent it can reach.[or] Your adversary pauses for a minute as the little skunk growls at it, startling it enough for you to land a hit![or]The little skunk charges in to protect you, and your opponent seems so startled at its sudden appearance it falls backwards[or] The little skunk tries to threaten your adversary from the sidelines, and spotting the skunk your adversary recoils in fear of its smell.[at random]";

		say "Wandering through the park you come across what was obviously the remains of a recent combat, the ground torn and savaged, and spots of blood staining the ground, looking around you find it hard to tell exactly what happened here, but you know it was violent.  You glance around to see if there is anything of use in the area, or if you can determine what the combatants were and why they fought, finding several strange boot prints and what you think might be a bullet casing, but that makes no sense... Sighing you prepare to go on about your buisness, when you hear a small whimpering noise from under a nearby bush.  Considering the state of the area investigating could be dangerous, do you look anyways?";
		If player consents:
			say "Looking under the thorny bushy you note a small hollow dug out underneath, far to small for anyone your size to fit in, but just the right size for the shaking little skunk kit that is currently occupying it, quite possibly the offspring of one of those large skunk beasts in the area as even though it is obviously just a child, it is still almost the size of a regular skunk.  Seeing you the little thing whimpers and shudders some more, and you can smell a soft whiff of skunk smell from the area, you quickly back off so as not to panic the little creature.  Taking a new look at the site of the battle now that you know what to look for, you imagine something was after the skunk beasts young and it objected, somehow this one managed to hide from whatever or whoever took the rest though. You feel a bit sorry for the little skunk kit, as it obviously is all alone now, but as it seems terrified of your looks and your smell, you aren[apostrophe]t sure what you can do to help.";
			if bodyname of player is "Skunk":
				say "Looking down at yourself you focus on your skunk-like attributes, and wonder if just maybe if you are careful the little skunk might not be drawn to them, you try to decide if you should try drawing the little creature out again.";
				if player consents:
					say "Deciding to try again, you once more approach the little creature, this time emphasizing your skunk-like attributes, you carefully try coaxing the little kit out of it[apostrophe]s hiding spot, offering it flashes of your skunk-like body and scent until finally it nervously emerges. Sitting down within easy reach, you wait while the obviously young skunk kit inspects you carefully, seeming to find something familiar about you, the little beast then throws itself into your lap, whimpering.  Feeling oddly maternal and protective of the little creature, you stroke it[apostrophe]s smooth fur and tell it that it will be all right, checking it over for damage as you do.  The lucky little skunk seems to have come through its ordeal with only a few small scratches from the thornbush, and is mostly just scared. [line break]";
					say "Petting and soothing the little beast feels almost natural to you, something about taking care of him speaking to the skunk-like part of yourself, and you lose track of how long you sit there petting his soft fur.  Eventually the little skunk stirs, its happy churring noises as it rubs its head against you playfully makes you smile fondly at him. Realizing you should probably move away from the site of the battle, you stand up and easily coax the little creature to a safer location a little distance away.  You laugh at it[apostrophe]s innocent frolicking and skunk-like antics as it tries to impress you with its fierceness and convince you to play with it and pet it.  After a bit you realize the slight skunk-like smell in the clearing seems to be even more comforting to you then normal, smelling a bit like home and other skunks.  Deciding somewhat sadly that you need to keep moving before another skunk follows the smell and finds you with the little kit, you sadly say goodbye and try to leave.  After a few steps you realize the little skunk is following right behind you, and when you try to convince it to stay behind and wait for other skunks, it gives you a sad look and starts whimpering at you again, afraid it offended you in some way.  Sighing slightly, you realize the little creature has imprinted itself on you and think[apostrophe]s you are its family now, unable to take the pathetic look it sends you any longer, you gesture for it to follow you as you head back to the park trail, its happy noises as it bounces along behind making you smile, it looks like you have a skunk kit of your very own now.";

The skunk kit whimpers for a second when it sees you are back, then seems to catch wind of the skunk scent rubbed on you, and your temporarily black hands and face.  Before you can do more then blink, the little skunk has awkwardly charged out of its hiding space, nearly falling over its own feet in its hurry to rub up against you.  You sit back as the small skunk rubs on you and tries to crawl in your lap, making soft whimpering noises.  Almost reluctantly you help it up and stroke it a few times to calm the shaking little kit down.  [line break]";
