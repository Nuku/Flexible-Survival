to say shark attack:
	if cunts of player is greater than 0:
		say "The piratatical shark grins down at you as you fall before her might, her sharp teeth flashing threateningly as she looks down at your defeated form. 'Ah now here is some fine booty just waiting to be had,' The shark says with a smug look as it moves over you, her rough body pressing your back into the ground and making you shudder as she rubs her slightly damp rough skin up against you, and you can feel something soft rubbing against your wet entrance. You stare in a mixture of horror and increasing arousal as you look down to see that a rather unusually shaped sharklike cock is probing at your body, while the shark beast holds you helpless underneath her. Soon her strange member works its way into you, making you squirm as it probes your depths, then the tip and sides of her cock seem to expand, locking her tightly within you.  'Now you can[apostrophe]t escape me my little treasure,' The shark above you says as she relaxes her grip, letting her webbed hands rub along your sides teasingly. 'And I think it[apostrophe]s time for me to 'bury' a little treasure of my own inside you...' The pirate shark says with evil satisfaction, as her cock moves and twitches within you in time to her short soft thrusts, causing you to writhe underneath her helplessly as her cock sends waves of pleasure through your body.  Soon you can barely think as the sharklike beast increases speed, her cock twisting and twitching inside you in ways you never imagined possible, bringing you to orgasm several times before she finally shoots her own load deep into you.  You can hear her chuckle slightly as she plunders your tired body, her cock pumping its warm seed into you, and then it finally releases you as she pulls out, leaving you lying there on the ground as little more then a helpless incubator for her fertile seed. 'I do hope it takes, but you should come back later anyways little pet,' The smug shark says as she stands over you, 'I[apostrophe]m sure I can find some more 'treasure' to bury within you next time you visit' The piratical shark says, tossing you a grin as she pets your stomach full of her seed with her webbed hand for a second, before turning and diving back into the water.[impregchance]";
	otherwise:
		say "The pirate shark grins at you as you collapse helplessly at her feet, her eyes running over your body with a hungry gleam, as her mouth opens wide in a sharklike grin as she reaches out with one of her webbed hands, and rubs it along your cock, making you gasp and stiffen at the feel of her rough palm on your sensitive skin. 'Well now it looks like I win,' The sharklike beast says in a teasing tone of voice as she pushes you down onto your back, 'And now I get to collect my treasure,' The beast groans as she lowers herself down onto your stiff cock, her strangely shaped walls gripping and tugging at your cock pleasurably as you moan underneath her.[line break]";
		say "You moan helplessly under the sharklike beast, as her hands roam your body, fondling and stroking you while her excited passage strokes and grips your cock. The feel of her rough wet skin rubbing up against your sensitive body makes you groan, your body growing even more sensitive to her touch by the second.  You lose track of time entirely as you give yourself over to the pleasure the shark beast is wringing from your body, your hips rising and moving into her almost on their own as her wet passage sucks and massages your cock. 'Mmm yes, give it to me,' The shark moans above you as she reaches down to fondle your balls for a second, 'Fill me up with that fertile treasure you are hiding down there,' She pants above you as your body tenses in orgasm, your cock twitching as it shoots its load deep into her body. 'Yes!' she cries out above you,  her body arching in pleasure as she milks your cock for all it is worth. 'Give it to me, it[apostrophe]s all mine, my treasure...' She pants above you, one of her hands holding her up as the other traces down her stomach to where your bodies are joined together still, her walls clenching tightly around you as they strive to milk your depleted cock of every drop of seed.   When she realizes you are completely spent, the sharklike pirate pulls herself off you, and gives you an evil grin as she adjusts her bandana slightly. 'That was some good plunder,' She says as she looks down at your spent form for a minute, idly rubbing herself in pleasure. 'Be sure to come back this way again sometime soon once you have got some more treasure now, I look forward to plundering from you again.' She says with a wink before she turns and dives into the waves."; 


To say shark loss:
	say "Your blows send the pirate shark reeling backwards, making the strange beast cry out in pain, before you can press the advantage though, the sharklike pirate turns and dives into the water again, her tail and her fin cutting through the water as she flees, somehow though, you don[apostrophe]t think you have seen the last of these shark pirates....";

Its long shark-like tail lashes against the ground behind it as it stares at you in obvious desire, its mouth pulled back in a grin exposing its many serrated teeth.

"pirate bandana"	"A slightly damp bit of black cloth, with a skull and crossbones on the front, closer inspection reveals that the skull has sharp sharklike teeth."	1	pirate bandana

pirate bandana is a grab object. It is part of the player. Understand "bandana" and "bandana" as pirate bandana. Pirate bandana is infectious. The strain of pirate bandana is "pirate shark".

The usedesc of pirate bandana is "Looking at the small piece of cloth, you decide to put it on for a minute, tieing it around your head and grinning at the vicious look it gives you. You pose for a minute in your new bandana, before the much abused cloth finally tears and falls to the ground, you sigh sadly at the loss of your new fashion accessory, but still feel much more piratical afterwards.";

				say " Finally giving in to your new instincts, you return to the coast and head out into the sea, leaving the military and the other infected to fight over the city itself, you realize there is a whole world out there for you to plunder instead.  Your handful of gold and your obvious nose for treasure and booty allows you to attract a large crew of fellow pirate sharks, all of them eager to be in on your next big find.  Starting out with this large crew lets you immediately start taking on some of the bigger ships in the area, especially the coast guard ships and transport ships for the siege of the city, their crews soon happily joining you in sharkdom as you travel along the coast.   Your own personal treasure increases with every haul, and few dare challenge you over it, such challenges you handily defeat and make examples of the losers.   As you take more and more ships, you begin placing the most loyal sharks in charge of them, as you spread out across the ocean, unsatisfied with just this one coast, soon pirates loyal to you are capturing ships all over the world, and sending back small portions of their treasure to the greatest of pirate shark captains, you!  Eventually most of the oceans fall under your sway, with nations offering you tribute every time their boats sail in order to have their boats actually reach their destination full of sailors and cargo instead of sharks and empty holds.  Life as a pirate is a damn good life you realize, as you and your fellow sharks help you set up your own personal kingdom on the large carribean island you basically bought with your plunder.  Eventually you retire completely undefeated on your island, starting a brand new pirate legend as the greatest captain of the new pirate age, and are happy to go about making the next generation of pirates with the best members of your crew or other sharks that manage to impress you, your treasure at retirement would make even most nations envious, though your most precious bit of treasure is still the handful of gold coins that you found, that started it all....";
			otherwise:
				say "Rescued from the doomed city with your humanity still intact, you find most people are just not ready or willing to accept someone as sharklike as you are, leaving you as somewhat of an outcast in normal society.  It doesn[apostrophe]t help matters any that you still have sudden urges to take what you want and to hell with anyone or anything in the way. You try several different jobs in an attempt to find ways to channel your aggressive tendancies, in all cases however you eventually get frustrated and snap at your co workers or boss and end up looking for yet another job.  The gold coins you found help smooth matters over slightly, and you dole them out in small bits and pieces, the loss of each bit of your treasure seeming almost a personal tragedy until you just cant take it any more.  You spend the last few coins you have managed to hoard on a rather powerful diving boat, and head out into the oceans to find yourself more treasure from the deeps, even if you have to take it from others.  Your sharklike skills soon allow you to find several other small treasures from lost or wrecked ships, but it still is never enough to make you as happy as when you had your first coins.  Soon you find several other pirate sharks in the seas, mostly wandering alone and leaderless after the military assault on the city, you quickly have these other sharks whipped into shape as a proper crew for your ship.  They seem almost happy to have some direction and a proper captain, and with their help you continue to hunt for and find treasures on the sea, returning to shore occassionally only to trade a few bits for larger or better equipped boats for your ever growing secret fleet of pirate shark manned ships.  Finally you are ready to really start hunting for your coins again, and begin making ships vanish mysteriously as you and your crews take up pludering and converting ships where no one will notice.  Each time you find some new treasure though, you always find yourself looking for and missing your original coins.   While you eventually become one of the richest and most powerful people on the ocean, even if few know how you got that way, you still feel somewhat unsatisfied at having lost your first treasure, perhaps someday you think, as you settle down surrounded by eager and happy pirate sharks, perhaps someday your descendants will find the treasure again, and it will speak to them you find yourself thinking, as you set about making those many descendants to carry on your secret pirate legacy.";

			otherwise:
				say " Escaping the city with your mind intact, you are careful not to mention your new found gold coins until you are far away from military hands, at which point you end up changing the small handful of coins for a rather nice amount of money, allowing you to get ahead of the other refugees from the city in estabilishing your happy new life, though sometimes you wonder if there might not be more treasure out there somewhere, just waiting to be discovered.";

Eventually with several different crews working together you manage to start taking cruise ships, and transport liners, your and your fellow pirates influence spreading throughout the ocean by leaps and bounds as your numbers increase as do your captured ships.  While several navies try to find and stop you, your ability to vanish into the waves, only to appear again swarming up the sides of the navies boats, soon makes this a losing proposition for the navies, and nets you several well armed boats as well.  Eventually you and your fellow sharks rule the oceans in all but name, and those traveling on them bring you tribute in order to pass unmolested, and you settle down on a small island of your own, with your crew at hand, and proceed to enjoy the leisurely life of a successful pirate, and breed the next generation with the best members of your transformed crew...";

On one of your swims off the coast you manage to find the wreck of an older boat, and while there wasn[apostrophe]t any treasure to be found there, this leads you to find your new calling in life.  Your sharklike features and swimming ability make you the perfect salvage diver, able to scout for and find wrecks with an ease most other divers envy, you even start a small tourist side buisness showing tourists some of the more interesting wrecks you have found. Most normal sharks steer clear of you in the water as well, making you feel safe and powerful when you dive, on one occasion a shark seems to take a liking to you, and hangs around you while you dive, and even follows your boat back to the small cove you call home.  Curious you spend some time diving with this strange shark, as it rubs its sides up against you and teases at you, and you finally realize just what it is after, you had pretty much despaired of finding sexual satisifaction amongst the humans who were intimidated by your sharklike looks, but it looks like you managed to find yourself a mate on the other end of the spectrum instead.";
