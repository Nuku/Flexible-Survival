Before you can respond, there is a loud splash as a shark-like beast erupts out of the water, its strange and sudden appearance startling you as you stare at it. The beast seems to be a cross between a shark and a person, with webbed hands and feet, as well as small breast-like bulges on its torso and a rather obvious shark-like genital slit between its legs, from which you can see the tip of a slight pink cock poking, as well as a slight wet opening below that. Its long shark-like tail lashes against the ground behind it as it stares at you in obvious desire, its mouth pulled back in a grin that exposes its many serrated teeth. Its head seems to sport a rather jaunty looking pirate bandana with a skull with shark teeth above crossed bones, and a similar bandana is tied to the beast's upper arm. [']Is this some sort of pirate shark?['] you find yourself thinking as it stalks forward. Its mouth opens in a grin as it says '[one of]Surrender the booty[or]Time to do some plunderin[or]You will make a fine addition to my crew[or]I think I might keep you[or]You're mine now[or]Looks like I found myself a treasure[or]You won't be getting away from me[or]I knew I'd find me some treasure in these waters[at random]!'

You lose track of time entirely as you give yourself over to the pleasure the shark beast is wringing from your body, your hips rising and moving into her almost on their own as her wet passage sucks and massages your cock. 'Mmm yes, give it to me,' the shark moans above you as she reaches down to fondle your balls for a second. 'Fill me up with that fertile treasure you are hiding down there,' she pants above you as your body tenses in orgasm, your cock twitching as it shoots its load deep into her body. 'Yes!' she cries out above you, her body arching in pleasure as she milks your cock for all it is worth. 'Give it to me, it's all mine, my treasure...' she pants above you, one of her hands holding her up as the other traces down her stomach to where your bodies are joined together still, her walls clenching tightly around you as they strive to milk your depleted cock of every drop of seed. When she realizes you are completely spent, the shark-like pirate pulls herself off you, and gives you an evil grin as she adjusts her bandana slightly. 'That was some good plunder,' she says as she looks down at your spent form for a minute, idly rubbing herself in pleasure. 'Be sure to come back this way again sometime soon once you have got some more treasure now. I look forward to plundering from you again,' she says with a wink before she turns and dives into the waves.";

pirate bandana is a grab object. It is part of the player. Understand "bandana" and "bandana" as pirate bandana. Pirate bandana is infectious. The strain of pirate bandana is "Pirate Shark".

The usedesc of pirate bandana is "Looking at the small piece of cloth, you decide to put it on for a minute, tying it around your head and grinning at the vicious look it gives you. You pose for a minute in your new bandana, before the much abused cloth finally tears and falls to the ground, you sigh sadly at the loss of your new fashion accessory, but still feel much more piratical afterwards.";

Starting out with this large crew lets you immediately start taking on some of the bigger ships in the area, especially the coast guard ships and transport ships for the siege of the city, their crews soon happily joining you in sharkdom as you travel along the coast. Your own personal treasure increases with every haul, and few dare challenge you over it, such challenges you handily defeat and make examples of the losers.

Eventually most of the oceans fall under your sway, with nations offering you tribute every time their boats sail in order to have their boats actually reach their destination full of sailors and cargo instead of sharks and empty holds. Life as a pirate is a damn good life you realize, as you and your fellow sharks help you set up your own personal kingdom on the large carribean island you basically bought with your plunder. Eventually you retire completely undefeated on your island, starting a brand new pirate legend as the greatest captain of the new pirate age, and are happy to go about making the next generation of pirates with the best members of your crew or other sharks that manage to impress you, your treasure at retirement would make even most nations envious, though your most precious bit of treasure is still the handful of gold coins that you found, that started it all....";

You spend the last few coins you have managed to hoard on a rather powerful diving boat, and head out into the oceans to find yourself more treasure from the deeps, even if you have to take it from others. Your shark-like skills soon allow you to find several other small treasures from lost or wrecked ships, but it still is never enough to make you as happy as when you had your first coins. Soon you find several other pirate sharks in the seas, mostly wandering alone and leaderless after the military assault on the city, you quickly have these other sharks whipped into shape as a proper crew for your ship. They seem almost happy to have some direction and a proper captain, and with their help you continue to hunt for and find treasures on the sea, returning to shore occasionally only to trade a few bits for larger or better equipped boats for your ever growing secret fleet of pirate shark manned ships. Finally you are ready to really start hunting for your coins again, and begin making ships vanish mysteriously as you and your crews take up plundering and converting ships where no one will notice. Each time you find some new treasure though, you always find yourself looking for and missing your original coins. While you eventually become one of the richest and most powerful people on the ocean, even if few know how you got that way, you still feel somewhat unsatisfied at having lost your first treasure, perhaps someday you think, as you settle down surrounded by eager and happy pirate sharks, perhaps someday your descendants will find the treasure again, and it will speak to them you find yourself thinking, as you set about making those many descendants to carry on your secret pirate legacy.";

Your shark-like features and swimming ability make you the perfect salvage diver, able to scout for and find wrecks with an ease most other divers envy, you even start a small tourist side business showing tourists some of the more interesting wrecks you have found. Most normal sharks steer clear of you in the water as well, making you feel safe and powerful when you dive, on one occasion a shark seems to take a liking to you, and hangs around you while you dive, and even follows your boat back to the small cove you call home.
