Section 1 - Coleen Events

WomanFruitTree is a situation.
The sarea of WomanFruitTree is "Park".
ColeenDeclined is a number that varies.

Instead of resolving a WomanFruitTree:
	if ColeenDeclined is 1:
		say "     Wandering back through the park, you spot the large tree in the distance, and decide to wander over to see what became of the stranded military woman. Upon reaching the tree you find that ";
		if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
			say "[one of]large scratches mar the tree from where something large and winged clawed at it, and the woman is gone, parachute and all. It looks like one of the wyverns stopped by to roost and found itself a new pet[or]as you expected the woman is gone when you return, her parachute straps slashed open by something with sharp claws. Looking around the area you can see where a large cat of some kind climbed up the tree to get to her and there are plenty of scratches and signs of clawing at the ground under the tree nearby. The beast obviously took her as his mate right there, the scent of felinoid musk lingering in the area where you find several scraps from her uniform[or]the woman is gone, and the entire area reeks with the scent of one of those strange large skunks. It looks like one of the creatures wandered upon the trapped woman and decided to spray the area several times. The straps of her parachute seem to have stretched and finally broken off the woman as she likely changed under the influence of the skunk's spray, letting her fall to the ground to get to know the skunk better[or]the woman is gone, though it seems like she finally managed to find her way down on her own as her booted footprints lead off towards the city. It isn't likely she will survive out there unprepared for long, and you are a little sorry you won't get to know what kind of creature finally manages to catch her[or]there is a brand new drone wasp still tangled up in the straps of a parachute, wings waving futilely as she tries to escape. Apparently one of the wasps in the park found her and flew up to sting the female soldier a few times while she couldn't dodge. You find yourself smiling slightly at her silly antics as she tries to escape, before continuing on your way[or]someone came and found the woman hanging here and took her with them. From all the hoof-prints surrounding the tree, it looks like a small herd of equinoids came along and decided she would be a nice addition to the herd[or]the parachute straps are now empty. From the looks of things something climbed up the tree and helped her out of them. Examining the tree and the surrounding area, you find signs that it might have been a lizardwoman. Even more amusingly, the tracks that lead away from the tree seem to belong to two of the humanoid reptiles[at random].";
		else:
			say "[one of]the woman is gone. The ground underneath where she was hanging is still damp and you see small pools of white liquid dotting the grass. Taking a closer look at the liquid you realize it is fresh milk. A smile spreads over your face as you realize one of the bovines wandering the park must have found her and given her a nice udder full of milk all her own[or]there are large claw marks all over the trunk where something large climbed it. Obviously, the woman has vanished although there are some shreds of her harness hanging empty from the tree. Examining the scene, you finally conclude that one of the bears in the area decided to climb the tree to claim itself a different kind of honey[or]the woman's empty harness is has been dragged up among the branches of the tree. Looking up you see a flash of a large fluffy squirrel tail among the branches. A grin spreads over your face as you leave the area before the new squirrel woman spots you[or]the harness is hanging empty up among the branches of the tree. From the looks of things someone or several someones had a lot of fun with the helpless woman. Bits blue fur and a few scattered feathers make you assume that one of those gryphons flying around found her here and enjoyed the nice treat the tree caught for it[at random].";
		now WomanFruitTree is resolved;
	else if mtp > 2:
		say "     Wandering through the park, you hear a bit of a commotion in the distance and spot one of the park creatures trying to get at something in a rather large tree. After a moment or two the creature gives up in disgust and wanders off into the park. Curious about the scene, you find yourself venturing closer to see what was so interesting. Looking up through the tree branches, you are surprised to see a woman dressed in military camouflage is stuck up in the tree, hanging by the remains of her parachute straps from several branches like some kind of fruit.";
		say "     As you stare with your mouth open at the strange woman bearing tree, the woman notices you and begins to talk. 'Hey! You down there, you seem a bit more stable than most of the beasts and things in these parts, would you mind helping me out a little here? I kind of got stuck up here when that big wind scattered my squad. It blew me right into this damn tree and I lost my knife and most of my gear when I hit the branches. If you could find a way to help me down I would really appreciate it.' As you look closer it seems she is indeed more than a little beat up from her ordeal, and many of her pockets were ripped and torn by the branches. Inspecting the tree, you think you see an easy way up to where she is stuck.";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]So... you have a way to help her. The only question is - do you want to do so?[roman type][line break]";
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - You can't just leave her hanging there. Of course you help her!";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Nah, you're not gonna climb all the way up there. Let her hang and get out of it on her own.";
		if player consents:
			say "     Deciding that you might as well help the stranded woman, you look around for anything that might help. After a bit of poking around, you do find a small military knife lying partially hidden in the grass a little ways away. Snatching up the knife, you realize it must have been knocked loose from the woman's uniform when she hit the tree. Smiling at your good fortune, you carefully climb up the tree to help the female soldier out. Reaching the area where her chute strings are tangled about the branches, you carefully cut through the strings while the woman watches you intently, the tree groaning and shaking underneath you.";
			say "     When the last string is finally cut, the paratrooper drops out of the tree, landing badly on the clawed-up dirt underneath. Although she manages to soften the landing at least a little bit thanks to her training, there is a scream of pain, showing that she got hurt on impact. Meanwhile, the branches of the tree shake and lash about as they are freed from the extra weight pulling them down, knocking you out of the tree as well. You groan as you land heavily on the ground, seeing stars for a minute before dragging yourself back to your feet.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Looking over to the woman, she seems to be in even worse shape than you are and is clutching her ankle in pain. Her trip through the branches and then falling to the ground seem to have left her in no shape to fight or travel through the city safely. Looking up, the woman notices you watching her, and gives a wry grin, 'Thanks for the help there, still it doesn't look like I am going to get very far like this, but at least I'm out of the tree now. The name's Coleen by the way. I guess it's pretty obvious we were sent in to see what the city was like and report back, course my radio is totally smashed now, so I guess I just have to wait for them to eventually move in and secure the city.'";
			say "     With a sigh, she tries to stand, only to wince as she puts weight on her injured ankle. 'Of course I probably won't make it that long like this. But I still have to try,' she says and starts looking around for any of her gear that the creatures in the area might not have taken. Feeling somewhat sorry for her, you hand her back the knife and mention that you know a relatively safe bunker in the city and that you can help her get there. She seems surprised at your generous offer, and happily takes you up on it. Allowing the female soldier to lean on you, the two of you make your way back to the bunker.";

You could fall down, or some sort of critter could arrive while you're up in the branches. Turning your back on the woman and tuning her calls for help out, you keep walking. As you wander through the woods, you do find yourself rather curious as to just what creature will eventually manage to reach that woman up in the tree and just what she will look like afterwards. Maybe you should come back and see later...";
