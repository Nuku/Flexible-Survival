Finally your lust crazed mind hits on what you think is the perfect scheme, and you hunt down a small group of those tigertaurs, and manage to tease them into chasing you. You lead the horny beasts right through the traps and down to the entrance of the Tiger Den, before ducking inside and taking cover as they burst into the room. Several of the other tiger men try to stop the horny beasts, but their susceptibility to the group of tigertaurs['] strong musk soon has new limbs exploding from their bodies as they switch sides. You yourself go and try to pick out a few of the prime females to escape with, and start to try to slip past the growing tigertaur orgy with them, only to find another small group of tigertaurs just now coming down the stairs. They spot you instantly, and before you can react they are upon you and your small group of handpicked mates, causing you to moan and pant in joy as your body shifts underneath them. You can see out of the corner of your eye your potential mates also succumbing to their changes as they moan in desire, and you realize you chose mates well. Because you realize as you give yourself over fully to the changes, soon they and you will both be very good mates indeed for the lusty tigertaurs, as you moan underneath the strong tigertaur that begins to mount your changed form, and eventually once you have all borne the litters your new mates are so eager to give you, maybe you will actually get to mate them as well your self, or even better, maybe they will mate you!";

Glad to be free, you and the rest of the tigers from the den promise to keep in touch as you spread out to contact old friends and family members, and rebuild new lives.

Smelling your heat Chase soon has you underneath him teasing your body and making you beg in need for him to fill you again and again, which he does several times over the next few days and nights of your heat. His body claiming yours in the most primal of ways, you realize just what you were missing in your life, a strong dominant mate to take care of you and see to your carnal needs. When your heat is finally over, and you know his seed has caught, he finds it all too easy to convince you to move in with him, and become his mate on a more permanent basis.

You yourself try several different things as you try to work your way back into society, but nothing seems to make you truly happy for long. Chase stays close to you though, providing companionship and is one of the few tigers that is around you at all times, finally you wake up one day and realize what he was waiting for, as your body burns with need and arousal. Wanting to share yourself with your friend, you raise your tail and let the tiger mount you, drilling his cock into you and pumping his hot seed into your hidden womb to breed you. Excited by the virile male atop you, you beg in need for him to fill you again and again, which he does several times over the next few days and nights of your heat. His body claiming yours in the most primal of ways, you realize just what you were missing in your life, a strong dominant mate to take care of you and see to your carnal needs.";
				say "When your belly starts to swell and you know his seed has caught, he finds it all too easy to convince you to move in with him, and become his tiger slut on a more permanent basis. Soon you are happier than you ever thought possible, as you work hard to please your mate, and to prepare for the cubs that are sure to come soon, and hopefully many more of his strong tiger cubs after that...";

With everyone rescued as well, you feel rather happy at managing to get so many of your fellow tigers out of the city both alive and sane, and they seem to feel the same, and while many of them reconnect with old friends and contacts, they all continue to keep in touch with each other as well. Many of you continue to visit, and work together, though you and Chase seem to form a special bond, based on your help while in the city, and the two of you spend more and more time together. Eventually you end up traveling and working together as partners and friends, though you sometimes feel something is missing from your partnership, you enjoy your time together, visiting many different areas around the world as you work to educate people about the wonder that is the greatest of the great cats, the tiger.";

Tiger ends here.
