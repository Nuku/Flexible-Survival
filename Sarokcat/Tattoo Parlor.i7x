Tattoo Parlor	"Tattoo Parlor"

Tattoo Parlor is a room. It is fasttravel. It is private.

The description of Tattoo Parlor is "[TattooParlorDescription]".

to say TattooParlorDescription:
	say "     The painted dragon tattoo parlor stands empty. Though there are signs that someone had stockpiled food and water for quite a while, most of the food has been eaten, and what water there is left is of dubious quality. Looking around, you'd guess that whoever was here last has only been gone for a couple of days at best. They were probably hiding here as long as they could before venturing out into the city when their supplies ran low.";
	say "     The tattoo parlor itself is both large and clean, rather reminiscent of a barber shop with its large mirrors, hair dying equipment, and adjustable couches. Every bit of the walls not covered with mirrors is devoted to all sorts of fantasy artwork, with everything from stylized dragons, to roaring felines, to biker gang symbols adorning the shop and displaying the different types of tattoos available.";

The invent of Tattoo parlor is { "dirty water", "dirty water", "dirty water" }.

instead of sniffing Tattoo Parlor:
	say "The tattoo parlor smells of smoke, alcohol and hyenas.";

tattoonpiercing is a situation.
The sarea of tattoonpiercing is "Red".

Instead of resolving tattoonpiercing:
	if tattoohunter is 0:
		say "     Wandering through the red light district, you come across a strange barricade that someone set up across the entrance to a small alley. A closer look reveals that the barricade is composed of all sorts of different items, including several large dumpsters and piled-on furniture, and it's assembled well enough that you fail to find a way past it. Shrugging, you hope that it will keep whoever built it safe from the creatures roaming the streets, though it's fairly likely that they've has already succumbed to the infection given the state of things in the city.";
	else if tattoohunter is 1:
		say "     Hunting through the red light district for the location Harold gave you, you wander the nearby streets, growing increasingly frustrated as you realize that it must be near here somewhere. Finally, on your third trip around the area, you find yourself looking at the remains of a small, makeshift barricade covering a small alley, and you decide to take a closer look. The barricade itself looks fine on close inspection, and it's actually remarkably well constructed considering the mixture of materials used to make it. However, it is obvious that someone on the inside moved key pieces aside and opened the barricade up so they could leave. Moving past the open barricade, you spot a sign not far along in the alley, apparently advertising the entrance to the Painted Dragon Tattoo and Piercing parlor.";
		say "     You grin at your successful find for a minute before glancing back at the opened barricade and getting something of a bad feeling about the situation. Moving forward carefully, you try the door to the parlor, only to find it unlocked. Going inside, you find the place to be eerily quiet, though it was obviously occupied recently enough. After spending several hours searching the place for any clue as to where Harold's friend vanished, you sigh and realize that you will have to return to the Palomino and let the unicorn bartender know that his friend isn't home, hasn't been for several days, and that they are probably infected by now, though you make note of the location in case you have to come back later.";

Instead of resolving findingkara:
	if tattoohunter is 3:
		say "     Wandering absently through the red light district again, you hear a small commotion from a nearby alleyway. Glancing over, you spot one of those hermaphrodite hyenas as she staggers out of it, obviously exhausted. Spotting you, the hyena moves your way, and as you brace yourself for a fight, you note that she looks a little different from most of the other hyenas you have seen so far. You blink as you take in the large number of piercings along the sides of the hyena's muzzle and the rings hanging from her ears, and you find your eyes drawn to the strangely colored patterns of fire and dragons that seem to shine as part of the beast's fur. 'Please, I need help. There are just too many of them for me...' she says as she stops just out of reach of your upraised weapon, the obviously exhausted hyena easy prey for the creatures you can already hear heading this way in pursuit. Do you try to help the strange hyena, or do you get out of here before the creatures can catch you as well?";

				say "     'Wow, that was amazing!' the hyena you saved gushes happily as she slips out of hiding. 'I never would have thought one person could be so strong! Though I guess I never would have thought this kind of thing could ever happen either,' she says with a smile and a shrug. She moves over to the battlefield and hefts a small duffelbag that one of the leopards dropped. 'Thanks a ton. It looks like they didn't even have a chance to do anything to the supplies I gathered,' she says with a happy hyena laugh as she checks the bag's contents. 'It looks like I really do owe you a big favor now, though maybe some supplies would help show my appreciation,' she says with a smile on her muzzle, her strong, hyena-furred body shifting sexily as she stretches and pulls out a couple medkits and some food and hands them to you. 'I have a store nearby where we can rest and recover too, and hey, maybe I can even find a way to help pay you off there, too,' she says with a happy grin, her piercings jingling slightly as she leads you down the streets of the red light district to a surprisingly familiar tattoo parlor.";
				say "     Once inside, she looks the place over and sighs at the empty room before introducing herself as Kara, the owner of the shop. Kara seems rather surprised when you mention Harold and the fact that he sent you here to look for her. A broad smile spreads across her hyena-like features as she clasps you close to her furry body in an exuberant hug. 'God! I am so glad to hear that the crazy bastard is still around as well, and a unicorn no less? That must be a sight to see!' She chuckles with amusement at the thought, then explains that she was holed up in her apartment above the shop for as long as possible before heading out into the city for supplies. Her eyes become slightly unfocused, and she pants slightly with lust as she explains her encounter with the hyena bikers, going into great detail of how they pinned her down and rode her repeatedly until she was a proper little hyenaslut they could bring back to their gang. Her words get you somewhat excited as she talks about how she begged several of the other gang members to fuck her needy body until she finally managed to pull herself together. She sighs slightly as she continues, explaining how she headed back to her shop once she could, though she still finds herself thinking of herself as a hyena gang member even now, and she warns you that since she let them know where it was, other gang members might stop by the shop from time to time as well. 'At least, I certainly hope they will,' Kara says with a lusty grin on her muzzle even as her aroused musk fills the air. Thanking the changed hyena tattooist for the story, you prepare to head back to let Harold know about his friend, though you find yourself wondering how he will take the news. Kara does seem strangely content with her new, sexy, hyena-like form...";

				say "     As you lie there, trying to recover from your powerful experience with the sexy leopards, you notice a soft jingling as the hyena creeps up to make sure you are ok. 'Sorry about that,' she says sadly as she helps you up. 'I have had a hell of a time so far in the city, and well, I just don't think I could take much more before giving in to the urges, so I hid,' she says with an embarrassed shrug, seemingly ashamed at having abandoned you to the tender mercies of the hunting cats. 'I have a shop nearby where we can rest though. C'mon...' she says, then leads you down the streets of the red light district to a surprisingly familiar tattoo parlor.";

It seems like not only were they riding their bikes, but they found someone to have some fun with in the district, too. Shrugging slightly since it [italic type]is[roman type] the red light district, you find yourself wondering where a group of hyenas even found bikes that still work in this crazy city, though the thought of hyenas in biker leathers seems strangely arousing as you continue along your way.";
