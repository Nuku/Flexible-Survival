to say ewe attack:
	if cocks of player is greater than 0:
		say "The ewe barrels into you one last time, knocking you to the ground, the lust crazed sheep grins happily as she looks down at your prone body, her thick tongue licking across her sheeplike muzzle as she gazes down at your already erect [cock of player] cock. Before you can do anything else, the ewe throws herself onto you, making you grunt In surprise as her weight lands on top of you, knocking the wind out of you as she pins you to the ground eagerly. Struggling to catch your breath, you find your head filled with the female sheeps powerful heat scent, as she rubs her soft silken fleeced body against your chest. Her scent only making your arousal worse with every gasping breath, your mind fogging over with pleasure as she lowers herself onto your stiff member. Soon your gasping becomes eager panting, as the female sheep lifts herself up and begins to ride your shaft, the intense sensation of her warm body gripping your cock tightly overwhelming any potential objections you might have. Soon you are bucking your hips up eagerly, as the sheep moans and bleats happily above you, your hands wandering over her soft woolen body even as her own hooflike hands rub up against your [skin of player] chest. Finally the sensations are obviously too much for the ewe, and with one last bleating cry, you can feel her juices coating your shaft as she shudders in orgasm above you. The feel of her body orgasming around your cock, triggers your own intense explosion of pleasure, and you grip her thighs tightly as you shoot your seed into her body, making her moan happily even as you twitch underneath her.  Once your orgasm is finally over, the ewe pulls herself off your exhausted body, a silly smile on her face as she proceeds to rub herself up against your body again, 'You[apostrophe]'ll make a wonderful Ram,' she moans as she lifts her soft muzzle up to your ear, her lips rubbing across your ear teasingly as you try to regain your scattered wits. 'A nice big strong Ram for me, won[apostrophe]t that be nice.' The ewe says teasingly, as she strokes your chest with her hooflike hand again a few times, before pulling herself to her feet, and staggering off into the city, leaving you lying there panting from your recent exertions, and wondering if you really would object to being a ram if you got that kind of treatment every day...";
		infect "ewe";
	otherwise:
		say "Finally! I won[apostrophe]t be alone anymore!' The ewe says as she rubs her body up against your defeated form. Her soft woolen scent filling your head as she begins to clutch you to her eagerly, 'If I had to spend any more time without a flock I thought I would go crazy!' The ewe says happily, as she holds you to her tightly, and while you are pretty sure she has already been without a flock for too long, the feel of the naked ewe[apostrophe]s soft wool rubbing up against you seems very soothing. You let yourself relax for a bit in her arms, as she chatters happily about the joys of belonging to a flock, and how very lonely she has been without one, even as she talks about what a wonderful sheep you will make. Slightly worried about that last part of her statement, you wait until your new friend falls into an obviously exhausted sleep, before slipping out of her arms and making your way back out into the city. You wonder what the lonely ewe will do when she wakes up alone again, and if perhaps it might have been better for her if you had taken her with you... ";
		infect "ewe";


To say ewe loss:
	if cocks of the player is greater than 0:
		say "Bleating sadly, the ewe collapses onto all fours in front of you, the defeated ewe looks up at you pleadingly as she stands there helplessly. Her lonely lust  filled eyes filled with need as she crouches down on the ground submissively.  As you turn to leave, you hear her soft voice beg from behind you.. 'Please, I[apostrophe]ve been so lonely... don[apostrophe]t you want me either?' She asks plainitively, making you pause as you look back to see her obviously needy rear raised towards you. Do you take the sheep up on her offer?";
		if player consents:
			say "You grin as you look down on the eager ewe, unable to resist her heat filled scent and the sight of her winking sex, you reach forward and bury your hands in her soft fleece, making her bleat eagerly in anticipation. Gripping her hips tightly, you slide your [cock of player] rod into her wet velvety opening, her passage spreading wide before your cock as she moans in pleasure. Feeling increasingly powerful, you begin to thrust into the ewes heat filled body again and again, her warm inner walls feeling like heaven, as each thrust brings you both closer and closer to your passionate climax. Soon your cock explodes within her, and you moan with pleasure as your seed spills into her body, she lets out a low bleating sound underneath you, as her body shudders in pleasure as well, before she collapses onto the ground.  Grinning as you struggle to stay standing on your unsteady feet, you look down at the happily fucked ewe sprawled out on the ground, enjoying the sated expression on her face for a few minutes, before you continue on with your explorations of the city.";
			infect "ewe";
		otherwise:
			say "Deciding it would be best to leave while you can, you leave the lonely little sheep behind you as you venture back out into the city";
	otherwise:
		say "Defeated, the slightly crazed ewe blinks for a minute, before looking at you and blushing slightly. She stammers an apology, something about how being alone without a flock for so long must have affected her mind, before running off into the city in embarrassment. Shrugging at yet another example of the craziness sweeping the city, you continue along your way, feeling somewhat proud of having knocked some sense into the strange sheep.";

					say "Your mind giving out under the strain of the infection, you head out into the city, Mary following along like a good little ewe. You quickly set about finding more members to convert to your flock, increasing your numbers for a time and protecting the trail of Ewes following you. Unfortunately you aren't alone in the city and are beset on all sides by different predators and infected until finally you and your small flock are captured by a group of hyenas.  At first it is somewhat disconcerting to be surrounded by predators, but soon you realize it isn't all bad.  As the only male you are indispensible to them, and you are kept in some comfort, your only duty is to breed the Ewes all day and relax.  Eventually you don't even mind one or two of your flock disappearing every now and then, and you even come to enjoy being sheared....";

Without the makings of a real ram, you aren[apostrophe]t quite able to form a flock of your own  with your friendly little ewe, fortunately though, Mary has a plan for you both.  Taking advantage of your increased strength, the two of you head out into the city together, your dimly recalled familiarity with the city, as well as Mary[apostrophe]s expertise in scavenging serving you well as you look for a safe location to set up.  Eventually finding a suitable spot, the two of you set out to trap yourselves a nice ram or two for you both to share.  It isn[apostrophe]t long before you have one of those rams wandering around without a flock trussed up and protesting in your new hideout, the two of you easily able to overpower his surprised form.  His protesting stops quickly however, when he realizes that the two of you need a nice male like him for your flock, and he resolves to do his duty eagerly.  He is somewhat surprised to find himself relegated to the role of a breeding stud, the two of you visiting him whenever the urge strikes you, and ignoring him otherwise. Your strength protecting the small flock instead of his, while Mary[apostrophe]s smarts helps your small group survive in the dangerous city, while he warms both of your beds at night. Your lust fogged mind is happy to have found such a lovely flock to be a part of, as you cuddle happily up against Mary the two of you spending plenty of lustful time together without your new ram, even as she makes plans for the soldiers which are sure to come soon..... and you feel a smile stretching your sheeplike muzzle as you realize your flock will probably be growing larger very soon indeed.";

You travel together for a while, but it is lonely with only the two of you.  You decide to settle down and raise a larger flock eventually, opening a small clothing and fabric store before settling down to breed some new young lambs.  The demand for your handspun clothing and well made designs quickly outstrips your ability to keep up, and so you find yourself hiring on a few other young women to help, who eventually join the flock eagerly after a gift of some of your 'specially treated' wool garments. You soon enough have a rather brisk buisness going, and a small but ever increasing flock to take care of you. Though the next time the building inspecter complains about the multiple occupancy you just might have to invite her into the flock as well....";

Once they let you go, you both head out together into the world outside the city, your changed forms make it hard to fit in however, and a flock of just two members seems rather lonely sometimes. At Mary[apostrophe]s urging, you both head out into the country, where you can start a small sheep farm of your own, both of you agreeing that at least having some fellow sheep around should be rather comforting to your changed senses.  When your flock arrives, the two of you feel much better immediately, and you discover the other sheep follow you around without protest when you lead them places, making your job much easier then normal.  You find one of the rams eyeing you and Mary rather often however, and are almost unsurprised to return home one day to find Mary bleating away happily underneath him. The sight is strangely arousing, as he finishes mating her, and she blushingly explains that her season crept up on her, and he was just so tempting and right there... Letting her know you aren[apostrophe]t upset, she smiles happily, before teasingly reminding you that your own season will be coming soon. Blushing in surprise, you look at the handsome ram nosing around your flock member, and much to Mary[apostrophe]s amusement, you let her know that you can hardly wait....";

However when you arrive and walk in, Leon and several other members of the flock pounce on you eagerly, the ewes holding you down for your dominant ram, as he makes sure to breed you again and again. Your urge to struggle fades, as he inducts you into the flock like a proper ewe, mating you again and again like the beasts you both are, your bleating calls of pleasure filling the store, even as the musky aroma of your flock surrounds you. When Leon is finally done claiming you as his own, you can hardly remember why you would have wanted to protest belonging to your handsome ram, your will overcome by your new urges, and the powerful males pheromones. You feel a silly smile spreading across your muzzle as the rest of the flock hug and stroke your more powerful body, making you feel nice and welcome as they help you settle in to your new home. Fitting in is surprisingly easy, as is just letting your powerful ram and the rest of the flock do your thinking for you, and your larger size and muscles ensure you a lovely position underneath your new master more often then not. Soon your belly is swelling pleasantly with the promise of new life, and your lust filled sheep like mind, can think of little that will be better then presenting your powerful male with lovely little baby sheep for his flock, and then having him fill you up with even more of them...";

					say "Returning to the store, Leon tries to bar the doors to keep you out, however the rest of the ewes are helpless to resist the sight of your powerful male body, and the ewe you rescued earlier unlocks the side door for you. You grin as you sneak up on the nervous Leon, before finally leaping on the flock leader and wrestling him to the ground. You enjoy having the formerly dominant male pinned underneath you, while the rest of his flock watches your struggle with increasing arousal. Finally Leon is forced to admit defeat, as you hold him down and tease his all to pliable body until he submits. As your new flock gathers happily around their new leader, their cheers and the soft strokes of their hooflike hands making you feel strong and powerful, you proceed to celebrate your position  by making Leon drink your masculine seed time and time again. Soon the former ram is just as female and needy as any of your other ewes, a change you help her celebrate by filling her with your offspring right away.  You enjoy several long nights of beastial mating, as you claim the entire flock one by one, ensuring their loyalty to their new ram and master. Settling in to the store is easy enough, and quite enjoyable to your instinct driven mind, your ewes taking good care of you, while you make sure they are all nice and well bred, though you single out two of them as your special favorites. Both Mary, and the formerly male Leon, share your bed every night, often with another flock member of two, and you enjoy watching them grow increasingly more submissive as their bellies grow round with proof of your ramlike virility.  Eventually the Military come through the city, and your flock sells some of the soldiers some basic equipment and items, and even arranges for some basic resupply from outside the city to fill the shelves back up again. While the soldiers suggest you should probably evacuate several times, you can only grin at them in amusement, more then happy with your new life here in the changed city. A viewpoint you share with some of the most promising soldiers, adding them to your flock when they won[apostrophe]t be missed, your flock growing slowly and steadily, and becoming the largest flock in the city, giving you quite a bit of bargaining power when the military are finally forced to come to the bargaining table....";

Soon after your release from the military camp, Leon leads you all to a secluded community out in the countryside, where you can all settle down in peace.  The flock settles into their new life with surprising ease, taking up several jobs in town, as well as starting up a small ranch of their own nearby, and you are happily in the middle of it all. Your more powerful form, as well as your still sharp mind, quickly making you Leon[apostrophe]s favorite, as well as his second in command. You enjoy the challenge of settling any problems with the concerned townspeople or visitors, especially when sometimes the settlement results in a new flock member or two, and coming home to the warm arms of your ram every night is a wonderful feeling as well. Looking around at your new life, you are hard pressed to think of how things could get any better then this, a grin crossing your muzzle as you look around at your increasingly sheep owned community.";

Leon is rather reluctant to let another male ram join them, but under the circumstances he can[apostrophe]t actually refuse, and you and the rest of the sheep end up going through the military base together. You make a number of 'close' friends among the ewes as they try testing you for infectiousness, before being forced to give up and let you go so they could focus on events in the city itself. Once free and out of the military[apostrophe]s hands, you and Leon lock horns for a bit over your exact position regarding the flock, since the ewes are very much in love with you both. Eventually for the peace of the flock, he ends up acknowledging you as an equal, much to your amusement, and the two of you end up leading your new flock together as you look for some place to settle down. Eventually purchasing a large parcel of land, and creating your own small self sufficent community. With the efforts of two rams, your flock and town begins to grow rather quickly, with the few visitors to your small community often ending up as nice new ewes for one or the other of you to play with. You have several small fights with Leon over the years, but a strange sort of friendship and rivalry develops between you, and keeps you working together through the roughest of times. As you settle down and listen to the latest news on the radio while your large flock gathers around you comfortably like the extended family you have all become, you feel a smile stretching your sheeplike muzzle, as you listen to the news about the complete failure of the military containment, knowing your flock is already ready for the new world that is sure to arrive soon enough.";

You lie low when the military assault the city, and you and your flock come out again once they have been driven back. Gathering up the remnants of the less intelligent flocks which were scattered by the assault, you soon have the largest and most powerful flock around, and happily claim yourself a nice piece of grazing land near the park.
