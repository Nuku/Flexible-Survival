Section 1 - Creature Responses

to say ewe attack:
	if Player is male:
		say "     The ewe barrels into you one last time, knocking you to the ground. The lust-crazed sheep grins happily as she looks down at your prone body, her thick tongue licking across her sheep-like muzzle as she gazes down at your already erect [Cock of Player] cock. Before you can do anything else, the ewe throws herself onto you, making you grunt In surprise as her weight lands on top of you, knocking the wind out of you as she pins you to the ground eagerly. Struggling to catch your breath, you find your head filled with the female sheep's powerful scent, the ewe rubbing her soft, silken-fleeced body against your chest. Her scent only makes your arousal worse with every gasping breath, your mind fogging over with pleasure as she lowers herself onto your stiff member. Soon your gasping becomes eager panting, the female sheep lifting herself up and beginning to ride your shaft, the intense sensation of her warm body gripping your cock so tightly overwhelming any potential objections you might have. Soon you are bucking your hips up eagerly as the sheep moans and bleats happily above you, your hands wandering over her soft woolen body even as her own hoof-like hands rub up against your [Skin of Player] chest. Finally the sensations are obviously too much for the ewe, and with one last bleating cry, you can feel her juices coating your shaft as she shudders in orgasm above you. The feel of her body orgasming around your cock triggers your own intense explosion of pleasure, and you grip her thighs tightly as you shoot your seed into her body, making her moan happily even as you twitch underneath her. Once your orgasm is finally over, the ewe pulls herself off your exhausted body, a silly smile on her face as she proceeds to rub herself up against your body again. 'You'll make a wonderful Ram,' she moans as she lifts her soft muzzle up to your ear, her lips rubbing across your ear teasingly as you try to regain your scattered wits. 'A nice big strong Ram for me, won't that be nice?' the ewe says teasingly, stroking your chest with her hoof-like hand again a few times. Without further words, she pulls herself to her feet and staggers off into the city, leaving you lying there and panting from your recent exertions, wondering if you really would object to being a ram if you got that kind of treatment every day...";
	else:
		if veggiegardenfight is 0:
			say "     'Finally! I won't be alone anymore!' the ewe says as she rubs her body up against your defeated form. Her soft, woolly scent fills your head as she begins to clutch you to her eagerly. 'If I had to spend any more time without a flock, I thought I would go crazy!' the ewe says as she holds you to her tightly, and while you are pretty sure she has already been without a flock for too long, the feel of the naked ewe's soft wool rubbing up against you seems very soothing. You let yourself relax for a bit in her arms, listening to her happy chattering about the joys of belonging to a flock and how very lonely she has been without one, then talking about what a wonderful sheep you will make. Slightly worried about that last part of her statement, you wait until your new friend falls into an obviously exhausted sleep before slipping out of her arms and making your way back out into the city. You wonder what the lonely ewe will do when she wakes up alone again, and if perhaps it might have been better for her if you had taken her with you...";
		else:
			say "     'Oh, I've got you now, little thief,' the ewe says with a chuckle, groping your chest and then down to between your legs as she presses you to the ground, rubbing her soft, woolen body against yours. 'I should make you pay me back for taking our vegetables,' she bleats, grabbing your head and pressing it between her thighs. With the arousing scent of her cunt in your face, you can't help but start licking her. She grinds her pussy against your tongue until she has a loud, bleating orgasm.";
	infect;

To say ewe loss:
	if Player is male:
		say "     Bleating sadly, the ewe collapses onto all fours in front of you, the defeated ewe looks up at you pleadingly as she stands there helplessly. Her lonely, lustful eyes filled with need as she crouches down on the ground submissively. As you turn to leave, you hear her soft voice beg from behind you. 'Please, I've been so lonely... don't you want me either?' she asks plaintively, making you pause as you look back to see her obviously needy rear raised towards you. Do you take the sheep up on her offer?";
		if Player consents:
			say "     You grin as you look down on the eager ewe. Unable to resist her heat-filled scent and the sight of her winking sex, you reach forward and bury your hands in her soft fleece, making her bleat eagerly in anticipation. Gripping her hips tightly, you slide your [Cock of Player] rod into her wet, velvety opening, her passage spreading wide before your cock as she moans in pleasure. Feeling increasingly powerful, you begin to thrust into the ewe's heat-filled body again and again, her warm inner walls feeling like heaven, each thrust bringing you both closer and closer to your passionate climax. Soon your cock explodes within her, and you moan with pleasure as your seed spills into her body. She lets out a low bleating sound underneath you, her body shuddering in pleasure as well before she collapses onto the ground. Grinning as you struggle to stay standing on your unsteady feet, you look down at the happily-fucked ewe sprawled out on the ground, enjoying the sated expression on her face for a few minutes before continuing with your explorations of the city.";
			if MaleList is not banned:
				infect "Ram";
			else:
				infect "Ewe";
		else:
			say "     Deciding it would be best to leave while you can, you leave the lonely little sheep behind you as you venture back out into the city";
	else:
		say "     Defeated, the slightly crazed ewe blinks for a minute before looking at you and blushing slightly. She stammers an apology, something about how being alone without a flock for so long must have affected her mind, then runs off into the city in embarrassment. Shrugging at yet another example of the craziness sweeping the city, you continue along your way, feeling somewhat proud of having knocked some sense into the strange sheep.";
