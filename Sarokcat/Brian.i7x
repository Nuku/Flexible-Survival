Brian is a man.
The description of Brian is "You see an exceptionally large and well built Rhino man, obviously heavily infected, over by a series of cracks in the border wall. Easily eight feet tall or more, his body is covered in thick rough looking grey skin, he balances rather uneasily on his large hooflike feet, a large thick cock hangs rather limply between his legs, swaying slightly as he moves. His face is a cross between a humans and a rhinos, though it seems to lean more towards that of a beasts, especially with the large thick bony horn that protrudes from the top of his rhino-like muzzle.  He doesn't seem to be the brightest of the infected, whatever he might have been before, this is emphasized by him lowering his his head so his horn is facing the wall... and charging forward at the thick concrete wall. There is a resounding impact as he staggers backwards slightly, holding his head, although you do think there are a few new cracks in the wall where he hit...";
The conversation of Brian is { "Ouch!" }.
Brian is in Border Wall.

the scent of Brian is "Brian smells like a male rhino, covered in sweat.";

Instead of conversing the Brian:
	if Briantalk is 0:
		say "'Huh?' The large rhino-like man stops staring at the wall for a minute, his eyes darting around until they finally focus on you. 'Oh hey, sorry I didn't notice you there.' he says, shrugging his large shoulders before glancing back at the cracked area of the wall. 'The name is Brian, and well, as you can see I kind of ran into a Rhino just a little way out of the zoo... I well I really don't want to talk about what happened with the rhino,' Brian says, his grey skin seeming to flush slightly in embarrassment for a second as he thinks about the encounter. 'You can see the end result plainly enough though,' He says as he gestures at his large rhino like form, his horn bobbing slightly as he shakes his head sadly. 'Kinda a big change, I mean I wasn't a small guy to begin with, but now. Well damn right?' Brian says with amusement.  'Kinda a bit harder to think clearly though, if ya know what I mean... but hey, at least it made me lots stronger, I should be able to get us out of here in no time now!'  The excited rhino man says, 'I mean ya know the military is watchin all the regular ways out of the city, but way I figures it, they won't be watchin this part with the wall, so once I bust my way through, it's clear sailering from there!' Brian says, getting even more excited by the idea, as he turns back to the wall, lowers his head, and charges it again. The impact sending him reeling back from the wall shaking his head, as he adds a couple more cracks to the already damaged area.";
		increase Briantalk by 1;
	otherwise if Briantalk is 1:
		say "[one of]'One more should do it!' He says as he charges the wall[or]'I'll have us out of here in no time!'[or]Brian is too busy holding his head from his last run at the wall to talk to you right now[or]'Watch this one!' He says as he charges.[or]'Woah' Brian mutters as he reels back from the wall, 'I can hear magenta..' he mutters, and you decide it might be best trying to talk to him later...[or]'Chaaaaarge!'[or]'Hey, haven't I seen you somewhere before?' Brian asks blearily, his large eyes unfocused as he tries to think.[or]'For the Horde!' Brian shouts, as he leads a particularly vigorous charge at the wall. Sadly the wall seems unimpressed at this passioned cry, as it remains standing, although Brian doesn't as he lands hard on his ass.[or]'If ya are just gonna stand there and watch, ya could like do some cheering or something' Brian says as he eyes the wall again.[or]' Eat this wallface!'[or]'Dude, you don't think all this headbanging is gonna hurt my brain any do yas?'[or]'Die concrete!'[or]'Woah, I can still hear my brain ringing from that last hit...'[at random]";


the fuckscene of Brian is "[attemptsexwithbrian]".

to say attemptsexwithbrian:
	if cunts of the player is greater than 0:
		say "'[one of]Once we get out of here, I'll be happy to fuck you up on that...[or]'Yeah sure,' he says absently, 'Just as soon as I finish up here.[or]Maybe when my head stops spinning...[or]That sounds nice dear.[or]Fucking you up against the wall?' He says in a puzzled tone, 'That doesn't sound like it would do much damage to the wall...[or]huh?[or]Fucking? Yeah I think I like fucking..[or]Are you kidding? Have you SEEN how fucking large my cock is now? I mean I could use it as a battering ram!  Hey wait, that's an idea...[or]I dunno, maybe later?[at random]' Brian says as he looks at you for a minute, before refocusing his attention on the wall.";
	otherwise:
		say "'Sorry dude, but I only like the ladies, I think anyways, it can be hard to remember sometimes' Brian says in an absentminded manner as he stares at the wall."; 


Brian ends here.
