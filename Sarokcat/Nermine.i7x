Section 1- The Mysterious Shop

The Mysterious Shop is a room. It is private. It is fasttravel.

The description of The Mysterious Shop is "Bells jingle softly as you enter this rather quiet and eccentric shop, this strange shop seems to be still open and doing fine even without power. Softly scented candles cast a dim light over shelves covered with strange and unusual items which seem to be displayed in no discernible order.  You can[apostrophe]t see any of the normal things you would expect to find in a mall shop however, no nicely packed boxes, no brand name items clamoring for your attention, no well marked shelves, just a rather large strange assortment of items spread out as far as the eye can see. Children[apostrophe]s toys are placed next to expensive looking decorations,  candle holders lying next to ornamental fans from the orient, almost as if someone merely grabbed anything that interested them, and then spread their new treasures out for people to see. Compared to most other shops you have been in, this one seems quite strange and mysterious indeed although with the city in the state it is currently in you probably shouldn[apostrophe]t be too surprised at the strange things you find, although for some reason you can never quite remember seeing this shop here before....";

Nermine has several items that might be fun for you to try out relatively cheaply...' She gestures at the small bin near the counter marked 'Bargain bin', 'Either way, you let Nermine know what she can do for you, or with you.'

'Unfortunately, Sexy equine has little Nermine wants right now, and is far to busy to send off on long quest to fetch items for a lonely jackaless, so it looks like Nermine will have to ask for same thing she did of earlier stablemaster at this point.

'Now Nermine warns would be Nightmare to be careful with the choker, it will prove just as effective on you as it will on current stablemaster, so be careful not to try it on yourself.' She says teasingly as she hands you the items, her words sending a shiver down your spine as you stow them away carefully and turn to leave. Though just as you are about to leave, you hear the shopkeeper say 'And Nermine hopes this one will remember their agreement better then the last one did, though maybe Nermine will still get to use curse she was preparing after all..' you hear her mutter, and quickly duck out of the shop before the creepy and strange shopkeeper decides to try cursing you just in case..";

Nermine grins as she winks at you before continuing, 'Fortunately for her visitor, Nermine has alternate method for you to gather ingredients for her, Is bar recently reopened in town, well bar club what have you, is called palomino or some such. Bartender there has been gathering ingredients as well from around town, and should have what Nermine needs as well.

'Though of course, were none around for quite while, until one you called stable master visited me a while back, He had of course already started to change, but didn[apostrophe]t want to be just another horse... We struck bargain he and I, and he held up only most of his...'

				say "'Does Nermine[apostrophe]s mistress like?' The sexy jackal whispers lustily into your ears as she rubs her body up against your back, her hands reaching around to stroke and tease your own soft nipples as she does so. 'Nermine wishes her mistress to make herself right at home in Nermines house, everything she owns is her mistresses after all, including Nermine herself..' She pants in your ear, obviously getting even more excited as she breathes in your strong dominant scent. You find yourself panting as well, from the jackal womans soft experienced touches, as she strokes her hands needily over your body. Your lust rising, it is all you can do to lead your eager little pet jackal over to the mattress, where you can sprawl out comfortably.  [line break]";
				say "Lying down on the bed, you position yourself on your back on the cushions, so you can watch with amusement as Nermine lowers herself down to all fours like an animal, as she crawls into bed with you. Deciding to see just how much fun you can have with this, you spread your legs slightly, giving her a glimpse of your soft jackal pussy, and are amused to see how her tongue immediately begins to lick along the sides of her mouth with desire.  Grinning, your own body almost as aroused as hers is by this point, you spread your legs all the way so she can crawl up between them and service you properly, which the newly submissive jackal bitch wastes no time in doing. The feel of her long canine tongue as it licks over your own needy pussy is a small taste of heaven, as you lean back into the silk covered cushions and groan in pleasure, soon her tongue is teasing the edges of your pussy as it licks over your crotch, making you lift your hips up in excitement with each pass of her flexible tongue. Nermine helps by shifting so you can rest your legs up on her shoulders, the feel of her head between your soft furry thighs is amazing, and you lose yourself for a minute in the pleasure of her soft fur rubbing up against your own, the silk sheets underneath you feeling amazing on your back, even as your canine hindpaws rub up against Nermine[apostrophe]s soft back. Once she has you positioned comfortably, she wastes no time lavishing your pussy with her attentions, her hands stroking your thighs even as you gasp at the feel of tongue pushing into your body. [line break]";
				say "Her narrow canine muzzle rubs up against your lips as she works her tongue in as far as it can go, shifting and teasing it around within you as you groan and clench the cushions underneath you in pleasure, the feel of her eagerly licking and nibbling on your clit as she laps up your juices is indescribably amazing, and after what seems like no time at all, and an eternity of pleasure at the same time, your body is shaking in a mind blowing orgasm as you let out a long canine howl which echoes around the room. Nermines body shudders as well as you rub your feet on her shoulders, as she laps at your pussy, eager to clean every bit of your juices up, before eventually sitting back on her haunches, your feet settling back down on the mattress as you relax in the afterglow. Looking at your eager pet, and how happy she seems to be with her new role makes you smile, and you pet the mattress next to you, and she eagerly takes the invitation to lie down and tuck herself up against your side. You smile as you drift pleasantly in and out of consciousness for a while, enjoying the new situation and your new pet immensely.";

'Amazing,' She says as she begins to pant eagerly, 'Nermine has never seen anything so wonderful, just looking at such a strong, handsome jackal is making her feel all sorts of aroused,' the shopkeeper says with a lusty moan as she begins to rub her breasts through her t-shirt, her reaction causing you to grin as she moans like a bitch in heat.

Seeing your obvious approval, she wastes no time in unclasping her jeans and slowly stripping them off as well, eagerly displaying her now naked body before you as she poses.

She moans eagerly as she stares up at you with adoration, the sight making you grin as you realize the scent laden ankh is working exactly the way the strange jackal man promised it would, you just can[apostrophe]t wait to see what kind of fun you can have with this in the back room...";

Bargain Bin is a man.
The description of Bargain Bin is "This large bin seems filled with a number of small packets, bottles, and charms, who knows what you could find in there? Above the bin someone has posted a recently drawn sign reading, 'You try bargain bin? You pull it out and you bought it, one pick for one packet of food and one bottle of water.' Reading the sign you aren[apostrophe]t exactly sure just how much of a bargain this bin really is right now, but you could still find something useful right? Maybe you should try HUNTing a bargain, or SORTing through the bin?";

You gape in surprise for a second, idly wondering just how the hell the creature fit into the bargain bin in the first place, before quickly preparing to fight as it steps towards you eagerly. The moment is broken by a sharp growl from over your shoulder, and the beast stops in its tracks and begins to back up in fear, and you glance over your shoulder to see Nermine fixing the creature with a deadly glare and a scowl on her muzzle. 'There is no fighting in Nermine[apostrophe]s shop, this she will not tolerate!' She says with a sharp bark, and the beast quickly turns tail and runs out the door, leaving you both impressed and a little worried as the surprisingly intimidating jackalwoman turns her gaze on you. You relax as she gives you a small peck on the cheek and a smile before wandering back to her side of the counter, 'Nermine must say, she is not sure how that got in there, but she would advise handsome customer to be more careful about the things they pick out of the bargain bin from now on.' She says with a teasing wink, and you curse slightly as you realize that technically you just purchased the creature that just ran off... maybe next time you should try looking for a collar and leash before it leaves?

With a shudder you find yourself fighting back almost instinctively, the power of your current form easily overpowering that of the totem, and with one last shake of your head you clear the last remnants of the intrusion from your mind. The thought of you bowing down submissively is so ridiculous it almost makes you laugh you think with amusement, as you look down at the little totem, only to find that at some point during the internal struggle, you crushed the small item in your hand.  Brushing the remains of the totem off, you shrug and guess Nermine won[apostrophe]t be giving you any help in that manner, and continue along with your buisness.";

Glancing behind you you surprised to see your ass seeming to stretch and change, your rear flattening out slightly as a small black jackal like tail forms behind you.  You feel a strange almost pleasant stretching sensation as your new tail grows until its tip is hanging just below your knees, staring at your new tail you find yourself experimentally moving it from side to side a few times, and watch as your new limb responds with surprising dexterity. Taking a few steps you are surprised to find your new tail seems to help your balance greatly, and you have to admit, the nice Jackal tail does look rather hot on you.

You quickly realize as the blackness spreads down your arms and starts to cover your body completely, that it is actually shiny black fur, sleek dark jackal fur just like Nermines. For some reason though, the idea of having soft and sexy black fur just like the nice and wonderful shopkeeper of that strange shop seems to make you feel happier and more content, and also perhaps just a bit horny as well. Somehow you are sure your nice new pelt of soft fur will appeal to more then just the shopkeeper as well, and find yourself looking forward to showing off your new beautiful looks.";

You are sure you see this totem grin and wink at you, before like the others it too cracks and crumbles in your hands, but you are distracted from this fact by the tingling spreading across your face. You reach your hands up to feel your face, even as it seems to crack and shift, your sight clouding over as your eyes seem to change, and your can barely see your new black furred muzzle pulling forward into a Jackals grin. You run your hands along the sides of your new Jackal like face, even as the bones settle and it finishes forming, new scents exploding through your brain, as your nose finishes shifting into place atop your narrow canine muzzle.  You blink several times, your eyes finally clearing as you stare out at the world through new sharper eyes, and the sounds of the world around you intensify as your new black canine ears finish shifting to stand straight up on your changed head.  You can feel a feral grin stretching your new muzzle wide as you think of how happy Nermine will be to see your newest change, your mind filled with thoughts of Nermine and the need to please the wonderful Jackalwoman.

Thinking about Nermine you realize you can hardly wait to get back and show her your new perfect form, and thank her for all her help in helping you become the submissive little jackaltoy she wanted you to be. Wasting no time, you quickly run towards the shop, unable to wait as thoughts of the pretty and dominant shopkeeper run through your head, maybe if you are lucky she will even have another job or two for you to do, and if you are really lucky maybe she will even play with you some!

Instead of Resolving a Strangeshop:
	say "Traveling through the deserted streets of the city, you stumble into a small gathering of Ashen dragators that appear to be squabbling over which of them gets what looks like a recently captured human.  Unfortunately they notice you almost immediately and a cry goes up as a number of them turn your way. Apparently your appearance has helped simplify the argument as they now have two humans to breed, and around eight or so of the dangerous fiery beasts immediately head your way.  Staring at the large number of beasts arrayed against you, you do the only sensible thing in this situation and abandon the other captive and run.  The beasts are hot on your heels though as you dart through alleyways and down the mostly deserted streets of the city.  You just can[apostrophe]t seem to shake your pursuers however, indeed you find as you run that your chase seems to have attracted good bit of additional attention from the beasts in the city. Glancing back, you find yourself panicking as you realize that you now have several wyverns and gryphons in the air above squabbling over you, and some harpies circling up ahead, and a number of different beasts giving chase on the ground now as well... worse they are gaining.  Your eyes dart around looking desperately for any avenue of escape, only to spot an alley up ahead, taking a chance you make a hard turn into the alley, and spot a half open door only twenty or so feet ahead. Putting on one last burst of speed, you waste no time in diving through the door and slamming it shut behind you.[line break]";
	say "As you sit there panting and hoping not to be noticed by the beasts outside, you are startled by a voice behind you. 'Well that is interesting,' The voice says, making you blink and look around in the dim light, noting the area is only partially lit, a number of candles bathing the room in a soft glow.  Before you can think of how to respond, you hear a click from the door, and look up to see a smooth hand covered in shiny black fur messing with the door you just slammed closed. 'Do not worry, no else one will be finding their way through that door now,' The strange voice says, as you blink rapidly to try to adjust your eyes to the dim light, you vaguely see a black shape with a white shirt for a minute, before it moves down one of the isles in what is obviously a strange store of some sort. You sit there for a moment while you calm down, before  looking around the shop you seem to be in, noting a larger glass door on another wall, you move to see if your pursuers are still milling around out there looking for you. You find yourself blinking in surprise, you didn[apostrophe]t think you had managed to run all the way to the mall, but it seems like you did without realizing it since this door opens right out onto the smith haven mall atrium, and though you have no clue how you managed to get here in time, you are definitely glad to find yourself somewhere safe.  With that thought in mind, you turn around to look at this strange shop you seem to have found yourself.";

You guzzle the rest of the delicious liquid gold as fast as possible, and stare blearily at your now empty cup, spotting the cask nearby, you move to get a refill, only to hear several satyr loudly carousing as they head this way.

Carefully you pry that cask open, and dip the vial into the liquid, pulling it out and stoppering it up when it is completely full.  Staring at the vial, you realize you now have the item Nermine asked for, and a surge of pleasure at the thought of being such a good little dog for your mistress shoots through you and makes your tail wag softly.

Once the last vine is loose, you don[apostrophe]t waste any time hanging around, and quickly run back out of the glade as fast you can, the feline beast right on your heels as you push and shove your way through the suddenly clingy viney curtain.  Outside the glade, you slow down and stop for a second, resting your hands on your knees as you lean over panting with exertion. Feeling a strange tingling sensation on the back of your neck, and catching a whiff of a strange musk, you look up to find yourself eye to eye with the felinoid you rescued, his face merely inches from your own. You freeze for a second as the feline beast sniffs you for a minute, before backing off and looking you up and down with strangely intelligent eyes, before turning and vanishing into the woods.  You let out the breath you hadn[apostrophe]t realized your were holding, and straighten up before heading back to the park entry at a run, deciding you have definitely had more then enough excitement for today.";

Suddenly the vines around you rip and tear, and you blink and gasp  at your sudden freedom, and a new wave of strong masculine musk washes over you as you fight to pull your way out of your viney cocoon.

Looking at yourself you realize you are completely made of vines as well, though in a slightly more humanoid shape, seeing your appearance makes you feel vaguely happier, as your somewhat diffuse mind takes pleasure in your green perfection.

Quickly shifting yourself downwards, you signal your readiness to your new companion, and together the two of you head out of the grove to find yourself a new location to anchor yourself so you can continue to grow. It takes the two of you some time to reach an area where your fellow plants have not already spread, and then there are few cracks in the thick black paving for you to sink your roots into, forcing you to continue to wander ever outwards.

You both quickly set down roots and settle in to rest, happy to have found this place before any of the other plants claimed it for themselves, you realize vaguely as you twine your roots together with that of your vaguely feline companion, that your success was likely due to the fact that there were two of you working together, your nearly simultaneous viney awakenings allowing you to succeed where likely many others have failed. You arent sure how much time passes as the two of you grow and bask in the sunlight together, your vines growing larger and more powerful, even as they intertwine with those of your companion, but eventually you both sense something nearby. Working together you easily manage to subdue the strange animal like creature, milking the trapped thing for its nutrients, before taking pity on the poor thing and wrapping it in your vines so it can be protected while it becomes a much better plant. You vaguely recall the animal was something called a human, which almost means something to your foggy mind, but is probably unimportant.  Eventually more of the animals show up, in ones and twos as if looking for something, and your glade grows quickly as you and your companion take turns showing them the pleasures of being anchored to the soil as well. Before long your first converts are eagerly helping you convert others as well, and as you bask in the sun and rub your vines through those of your once feline companion, you realize you truly have found a wonderful place for your new glade...";

Section 8- Strange doll


strange doll is a pet. "The strange looking doll that you found in the bargain bin of the unusual shop, the small doll seems to always look exactly like you, changes and all. The most unusual part of the whole thing is how it happily follows along behind you loyally wherever you go, its plush body moving on its own through some unknown method. Still just looking at the little thing manages to bring a smile to your face.". 
strange doll is a part of the player;
The weapon damage of strange doll is 7;

The Dexterity of strange doll is 8;
The summondesc of strange doll is "You pull the strange little doll from the shop out of your pack, and set it on the ground next to you, the doll lies there for a minute on the ground, before twitching and picking itself up. The little miniature version of you looks around the area, before looking up at you and saluting, obviously ready and willing to help.";

Your former doll seems to approve of her newly altered body, purring and rubbing herself up against you, eager and happy to be a proper little member of your plush pride.";  
			otherwise:

You aren[apostrophe]t able to figure out just when the little toy finishes changing, but before you know it, instead of being kept company by an animate toy, you have a perfect twin of your new self keeping you company instead.

		otherwise:
			say "[one of]Escaping from the city with your sanity, it was easy enough to sneak your little doll through the military as just a toy, the soldier who examined it even commenting on how cute it was. Once in the outside world, you bring the doll with you most places, as sort of a living good luck charm, even letting your little mini you help with your chores and work when no one is looking. You find it easy to confide in and talk to the attentive little doll, and come to enjoy its quiet company in your life, its easy acceptance of your body and your shared experiences in the city making it the perfect listener.[or]Rescued by the military, they seem to have no problem letting you leave the city with your little doll, even thinking it cute how much the little thing looks like you.  You grin at how little they realize, and smile and nod as they let you go free.  Once safe in the outside world, you take the doll with you until you find a place to stay, enjoying its presence as it keeps you company most nights, at some point you would swear it was actually growing larger as time goes on, but you shrug it off as unimportant.  Eventually you are woken up in the night by something on top of you, and you struggle until you realize it is the strange little doll, which now looks exactly like you, and not very doll like at all. You try to talk, but your double just kisses you lewdly, before whispering into your ears that since you have been such a good master for it, it will take care of all those evil chores and work and things for you, so you can relax.  You are nervous at first, but no one seems to tell the difference between you and the doll, and so you can lounge around and relax, finding it strangely easy to do nothing as you stay at home, not even bothering to try to think for long periods of time.  Eventually you realize that you are shrinking one day, when your double reaches down to pet you on the head, you try to figure out what you can do about this, but it seems like such hard work to think.  Several days later when your former doll picks you up and sets you on a shelf, you realize that you have actually become a doll version of yourself, while the other doll lives your old life! You try to struggle and tell someone what has happened, but your size and cuteness means no one takes you seriously, not that you have much luck even talking to them either... soon though you begin to wonder what the point in trying is, its so much easier to just go with the flow and do what your large master does, like a good little mimicking doll...[at random]";
