to say ResolveEvent Hyena Cages:
	say "     As you walk around the zoo you come to an enclosure. A couple of the metal bars that once held its residents inside are broken and bent, leaving a gap large enough for a human-sized creature to get through. Whatever escaped must have been quite strong to break solid steel. With a cursory glance at the enclosure you can see a pile of cloth scraps lies just outside the bars, the smell of cum wafts over from the pile leaving little doubt as what might have happened to it.";

	now Hyena Cages is resolved;

to say Hyena Breakout Video:
	say "     You slide the tape found in the hyena enclosure into the camera, pushing down on the side panel till it locks into place with a *click*. Then you fold out the small screen of the device, looking at it expectantly as you press 'Play' next. The screen flashes to life and you see the animal enclosure from earlier, only this time it's inhabited. Two hyenas pace back and forth in the enclosure, eyeing the bars expectantly.";
	say "     Without warning the hyena on the left jumps at the bars, snapping and growling at the cameraman. The sudden movement causes the holder of the camera to fall backwards, and as their arms flail to catch themself the camera goes flying. It lands several feet away, miraculously still intact, pointing toward the male figure now flat on his back. In the few moments it took for all of this to happen the other hyena has joined the first, and the bars begin to bow dangerously outward, creaking in warning. With a sudden snap two of the bars break almost at the same time, releasing both of the feral hyenas. The man, jerked out of his stupor by the loud sound, scrambles to his feet and turns to run.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     No sooner has the man started running toward the camera before the first hyena jumps onto his back, pushing him to the ground. The second hyena comes around the man's front, and it's then that you notice the dark pink rocket starting to lengthen and swell in obvious arousal under its belly, informing you that it's most likely a male. The hyena on the man's back starts clawing with its hind legs, trying to push the man's pants down while still being hunched over on his back. After only a few tries his trousers drop, along with his underwear, leaving them in tatters around his ankles and the man's skin streaked with pink or red scratch marks. As the man's pants fall, two things become apparent: First of all that the hyena's cock, pointing down toward the ground, is so big its tip nearly touches the floor. Secondly, against all logic, the man is starting to get an erection of his own, his semi-hard length clearly visible against the hyena's bigger and darker shaft.";
	say "     The second Hyena approaches the man's face, its cock swaying slowly underneath its belly with each step. Rising up against the man's head and shoulders, managing to avoid bumping heads with its partner, the hyena ends up with said cock poised in front of the poor victim's mouth. After having it shoved against his face a few times, likely getting hyena precum smeared all over his face, the man finally opens his lips for the pointed head. As soon as the hyena's prick enters the man's mouth it starts violently jackhammering into his mouth, making the man choke and cough from the rough facefucking.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Even as the second hyena pounds away at the man's mouth, the first one lines its shaft up for the held-down man's behind, hips jerking with each attempt to get inside. At first it seems to be aiming a little too low, as though used to a different kind of anatomy, but after a dozen or so tries it finally hits the mark. The man jerks a little as it shoves its whole length in on the first thrust, but he doesn't try to move away. Instead, after a few seconds of hesitation, he actually seems to push back against the cock in his ass. The hyena doesn't really need to be encouraged though, as it's already enthusiastically pounding in and out of its victim's ass, just like the other one is doing at the front. A few minutes later the second hyena cackles with pleasure and slams its cock into the man's mouth one final time. You can see its balls, larger now than they were before, contract almost rhythmically, and the man's Adam's apple bobbing up and down with each swallow makes it obvious what's happening. The clear liquid slowly dripping from his own neglected erection makes it just as obvious that he's enjoying himself.";
	say "     Suddenly, half-hidden as it is behind the hyena's lower body, you can see the man's face begin to shift, elongating and turning more bestial. Fur starts sprouting on his cheeks, and as he gasps for air you see a glint of sharp teeth growing in his mouth. The man then groans, seemingly in pleasure, as the spotted fur spreads further down his body. The hyena behind him speeds up, ramming its hard cock in and out with animalistic fury, and then lets out a sound halfway between a growl and a groan as it buries its cock as deep as possible inside its initially reluctant mate and holds still. The man's skin goes flush as the progress of the fur spreading over his body speeds up, now reaching down to his legs and arms. You can see him twitch and shudder as the bones shift underneath the skin and fur, and he gradually ends up with an animal's legs and furry, padded hands and feet.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The man isn't the only one to change either; the two hyenas also seem to be affected, though in their case their limbs lenghten slightly, the digits on their front paws growing longer, and despite the small screen you think you can detect a small hint of awareness in their eyes. A minute or two later, when the two hyenas push themselves off the man, it's to stand somewhat awkwardly on their hind legs, looking down at the now anthro hyena between them.";
	say "     The next few minutes of the tape show the newly transformed hyena man making out with his partners, his long sloppy tongue mingling with theirs. When they finally pull away and turn to depart, the former human tears off the remainders of his now tattered shirt, steps out of his ruined pants, and tosses the scraps nonchalantly aside. Whether intentional or accidentally, they land on top of the camera, smearing the lens with cum and leaving it in near-complete darkness. A little while later the batteries die and the video ends.";

Unfortunately, he is stranded in the middle of one of the more open enclosures, standing on a rock in what appears to be a lake of cum. You blink at the sheer amount of the stuff coating the area, but you are distracted by some rough slapping sounds underneath the hoarse cries of the trapped employee.";
	say "     Looking around, you are shocked to spot two massive mounds of gray flesh going at it not far away, their sheer size making it hard to recognize them as the human-like herm elephants they are instead of, say, small buildings. You find yourself gaping at the ridiculous size of the one on the bottom's cock, then clap your hands to your ears as they both trumpet, the one on top erupting into the one on bottom, and the one on bottom erupting everywhere. The trapped employee moans as the lake of seed around him rises even higher. The elephant herms take a minute to rest before switching positions and starting up all over again.";
	say "     Sadly, you really don't see any way you can reach the employee to help with anything short of a helicopter, and you certainly aren't up to taking on two large foes of that size. Shaking your head, you move off into the zoo, trying not to shudder at the soon-to-be-elephantine employee's cries.";

The smell of snakes and sex fills the area, and their hissing is only broken by the occasional moan or cry of ecstasy, proving that there are a few non-snakes caught up in their mating knot as well, though you are sure they're soon to transform. Carefully, you back away from the door, not desiring to get caught up in their mating frenzy, though it could be fun to try if there were fewer of them...";

Unfortunately, it seems several other people or creatures were here before you, and it is obvious not much [']resting['] occurred, although several of the participants were probably horizontal at one point. Looking around, you survey the splatters of cum from several unidentified participants, several articles of shed clothing tossed around haphazardly, and a variety of mixed animal prints tracked in the dirt. You really aren't sure just who all or what all enjoyed themselves here, but they definitely had a lot of fun. Sighing, you leave without taking a rest, the scene making you too nervous, and aroused, to stay there any longer.";

The second panda is swiftly followed by two more female pandas, each batting at each other as they try to get ahead, and finally one last slightly pandalike female trailing along after everyone else, the final one still kicking off its encumbering clothing as it continues to change into a full panda.

Obviously, there was a school bus visiting the area at some point recently. You sigh as you look around, then give a halfhearted search of the backpacks lying around.

Strangely most of what seems to be contained within is a variety of animal hormone shots, and treatments for either male or female animals depending.

	say "     Traveling through the deserted zoo, you come across the entrance to a security station. While normally the doors to such areas are locked tightly, this one seems to have been broken down at some point during the recent troubles. Deciding to take a look inside, you can see the security station has several monitors that appear to be working at a glance, although some of them appear to be playing on a loop. Moving into the small security area, you note that it smells like bestial sex in here, leaving no doubt as to why the security station was broken into, the rich musky scent makes your body tingle with lust, and you realize you can't stay in here for long without becoming even more aroused than usual. Still there might be something of use in here, you think as you search the small monitoring room, you find your eyes continually drawn to the monitors however, as the action on the screen repeats itself over and over. Soon you stop even trying to search the area, and are just watching intently, as a cheetah woman teases a zoo intruder into becoming her male mate, and the scene as a pair of wolftaurs burst out of the bathroom and run down some of the zoo paths, before the male catches the female and begins to mate her like an animal. Other scenes of sex and transformation are played out on the monitors in front of you, but you manage to pull yourself away from the sexual scene and scents, and stagger out of the Security booth. Somehow sure that if you had stayed much longer, you would have stayed there watching the sexual scenes and growing increasingly aroused until one of the beasts in the zoo managed to find you in there, and given how aroused you already are.. by that point you might not even have fought whatever strong sexual beast came to take you... Shaking your head to try to clear it of the increasingly lewd thoughts you continue on your way through the zoo.";

	say "     While traveling through the zoo paths, you note a small broken area of the underbrush, and out of curiosity move a little closer to take a look. Behind the foliage, you can see the back of one of the animal enclosures, a nice thick area of fence designed to keep the animals inside. Of course in this case you can see how this group of animals got out, as the fence has been broken and torn here where it isn't easily visible, leaving more than enough room for someone, or something, to slip into or out of the enclosure. Examining the edges of the fence, you find yourself more than a little worried about encountering something able to do that kind of damage to the special cage fences, and you decide to move along down the pathway quickly, just in case it might still be in the area.";

Somewhat panicked, you waste no time in ducking down behind one of the bushes, doing your best to conceal yourself from whatever is approaching. You are just in time to see a large group of different beasts come charging down the zoo pathways, obviously hot on the scent of a still changeable person. You hold your breath as the small stampede passes, only letting it out after they have all passed by safely, sighing with relief as you step out of your impromptu hiding place. Hearing a noise behind you, you realize that you started to relax too soon, as when you turn, you find yourself staring at one of the beasts that was straggling behind the stampede!";

You freeze as you hear a noise come from the branches up ahead, and slowly look up, not seeing anything for a minute, before suddenly realizing that a large leopardman is slowly moving across the branches. You feel your cheeks heating up even as you try to hold your breath, your eyes fixed on his large sheath even as the spotted leopardman slowly shifts into the next tree. You watch with a mixture of fascination and a strange desire as the sleek feline stretches up from his position in his newest tree, until he can grip the top of the zoo wall easily. You blink as in one swift movement the lithe Leopard hauls himself onto the top of the wall, before sliding down out of sight on the other side.";

Smiling, you pull the curtain to step inside, only to find your nose assaulted with the scent of sex and musk. Letting the curtain fall, you gasp for some clean air. As you do so, you notice that the slot that dispenses pictures seems to have a strip already in it, and curious, you pull the strip of pictures out.";
	say "     Blinking, you stare down as a handsome young teenager poses against an African background, a zebra close behind him. The next picture shows the young man turning as the zebra puts its head on his shoulder, an actual zebraman that appears to have been hiding in the booth. The next several shots show in full color detail the zebra stallion pinning the changing man up against the side of the photo booth, as his body lengthens and is covered in stripes. The final photo is a wonderfully done photo of a zebra stallion mounting an eager zebra mare with a lewd smile on his snout.";
	say "     You shudder as you realize how lucky you are to arrive here late. If you had been the first person into that booth, there would have been no way for you to escape or fight in such a confined space.

Floating lazily along, he pumps and strokes his throbbing shaft.
