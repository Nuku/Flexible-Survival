'Now that's what I like to see,' He says as he takes in your naked body, his eyes lingering on your now exposed slit. Leon grins as he slowly begins stalking forward, something in the way he moves making you feel smaller and more needy as he draws close to you, his strong masculine musk filling your nose and making your insides clench in need.

You hear Leon chuckle softly behind you at your obvious wantonness,  before you can turn your head to look behind you, you feel your vagina split open as he impales you with his rod in one swift move.  Gasping in shock and pleasure you quickly lower your head as he begins to slowly slide himself in and out of your needy pussy.

Leon only thrusts harder with each noise, seeming encouraged and turned on by your obvious sign of submission.[end if] As Leon begins to rock his hips forward even faster, you can feel his front leaning over you pressing you down into the bench even further, his rod moving within you making your eyes close in pleasure as your mouth hangs open weakly.  You feel your mind emptying out of everything else except for the strong ram above you and his wonderful tool as he breeds you, your body signalling its total submission to his dominance, with your mind quickly following suit. Nothing seems quite as important to you anymore as being just another mindless part of the flock, surrendering body and soul to the strong male above you.  As if sensing your readiness to submit, Leon thrusts forward one last time, his voice rising in a triumphant bleat as his cock explodes within you, your mind exploding with pleasure as he coats your insides with his fertile dominant seed. Moaning at the feel of his fertile treasure within you, you find yourself unable to do anything but shudder as aftershocks run through you,  before he pulls himself out of you.  You can feel him pat you on the back as you lie there helplessly before hearing the door open and shut as he leaves you alone to recover and pull your shattered mind back together. Eventually you recover and manage to clean up and drag yourself back outside, a little bit worried at how easily he reduced you to just another mindless ewe, and a little bit excited by it as well.[impregchance]";

You can't help but stare in fascination as your rams strong male musk fills the room, its earthy scent going straight to your head and making your own cock tighten in response. Quickening his strokes, before you know it, Leon cums with a loud Baaaing noise, as his seed spurts all over your face, covering you in his sticky ram juices.  Blinking to clear your eyes, you cant help but lick your lips, tasting his seed on and in your mouth, as the rest sinks into your skin. As the strong taste of his male seed shoots through you, you can feel your body twisting and changing in response, becoming better suited to being a proper ewe to his ram.   'Ah, that was good.' Leon says as he begins to clean himself up, 'I'm looking forward to our next time, already, and seeing how you look as a proper ewe.' he finishes with a lewd wink before ducking out the door.

Mary is standing there blushing again as she admits 'I found this place a while back, and i cleaned it up for when i needed to get away from the rest of the flock. You[apostrophe]re the only other person who knows about it now.' Before you can respond to her surprising statement, she reaches up and kisses you again, taking her time to rub her sheeplike muzzle along your [facename of player] face, and exploring your mouth with her tounge.";

Smiling as you do so, she cuddles up next to you and rests her head on your shoulder. Seeming somewhat embarrassed she begins telling you about her life from before, as a teenager working her way through college at her parents store, and asking questions about your life and what it was like.";

Not really wanting to end up like some of the rest of the flock who seemed to lose most of their intelligence the more they stayed there, she volunteered to do much of the scouting and scavenging for the rest.  She was able to put Leon off of claiming her personally so far, but she figured it was only a matter of time before he got to her, until she met you. She says with a yawn, staring up at you adoringly, she thinks she could really like being part of your flock instead.";
				say "You continue to talk about a number of subjects as you both relax, eventually Mary falling asleep in your lap. Softly moving her into a more comfortable position, you realize how much your comfortable time with your new flock member seems to have changed you, even making you smell a bit like her.";
