Pirate Island	"Pirate Island"

Pirate Island is a room. It is fasttravel. It is private.

Description of Pirate Island is "     Finally, the island with the treasure marked on the map! The small island seems to be a rather nice island not far off the coast, seeming just like many other similar islands in the area. This one, however, happens to be riddled with what seems to be a rather large amount of caves and tunnels, just waiting to be explored.".

instead of sniffing Pirate Island:
	say "The island smells of the ocean and fetid sea caves.";

Treasure cave	"Treasure cave"

Treasure cave is a man.
Description of Treasure cave is "     Not just one cave, but a large series of caves that dot the shores of the island. They look like the perfect place for some suspicious pirate to have hidden some treasure. Still, the dark openings look ominous, and you can hear water sloshing within some of them occasionally. It will take a lot of bravery to explore these caves. You will have to [']hunt for treasure['] in them.".
Treasure cave is in Pirate Island.

No clue what's on the island though, but the scratchings on the front part are definitely a warning about pirates[if level of Player < 7]! You'd best toughen yourself up before trying to find a way over there[else]! Best be careful[end if].' Rod says with a shrug, then grins.

Not me though, but hey whatever you're doing, it sounds kinda exciting. Let us know how it all turns out, OK? And if ya see any sea rats, say hi for us,' Rod finishes, before he goes back to his being cool and hanging around the food court.
