Section 1- Pirate Island enviornment

Pirate Island is a room. It is fasttravel. It is private.

The description of Pirate Island is "Finally the island with the treasure marked on the map! The small island seems to be a rather nice island not far off the coast, seeming just like many other similar islands in the area, this one happens however to be riddled with what seems to be a rather large amount of caves and tunnels, just waiting to be explored.";

instead of sniffing Pirate Island:
	say "The island smells of the ocean and fetid sea caves.";



Treasure cave is a man.
The description of Treasure cave is "Not just one cave but a large series of caves that dot the shores of the island, they look like the perfect place for some suspicious pirate to have hidden some treasure.  Still the dark openings look ominous, and you can hear water sloshing within some of them occassionally, it will take a lot of bravery to explore these caves.  You will have to [']hunt for treasure['] in them.";
Treasure cave is in Pirate Island.

	say "Possible Actions: [link]hunt for treasure[end link], [link]smell[as]smell treasure cave[end link][line break]";

instead of sniffing Treasure cave:

But it seems water leaked into the bottle and the message is unreadable except for a short scrawl at the bottom that says: 'The treasure hunt requires guy, hermaphrodite and furry content to be available.  Please try again.  No purchase necessary.  Void where prohibited.  May cause unexpected priapism.'  Hmmm... very strange.";

It is very difficult to read, but something about 'rats' and 'missing the food court' can be made out.  There also seems to be some kind of warning about some kind of pirate sharks in the deeper water? The marks on the back almost seem to be some kind of map, though without some kind of reference or a boat, it is totally useless to you right now.  Still if there are pirates, there might be treasure, right?  Just to be on the safe side, you brush some short, gray hairs from the map, roll it up and stick it in your pocket anyway.  Perhaps you should do some more investigating.";

No clue whats on the island though,  but the scratchings on the front part are definitely a warning about pirates[if level of player < (7 - levelwindow)]!  You'd best toughen yourself up before trying to find a way over there[otherwise]!  Best be careful[end if].'  Rod says with a shrug, then grins. 'Turns out one of our guys left and ran into some sea rats out there somewhere, too.  Some of the other mall rats are thinking about hitting the beach sometime to find [']em.  Not me though, but hey whatever you're doing, it sounds kinda exciting.  Let us know how it all turns out, ok? And if ya see any sea rats, say hi for us,' Rod finishes, before he goes back to his being cool and hanging around the food court.
