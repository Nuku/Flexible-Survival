You jump back as it lands right in front of you and get a closer look at the anthro raptor's body as he stalks towards you on taloned feet. The strange bird-man has large, hawk-like wings stretching out from his back, clearly flight-ready given the creature's aerial approach. He is covered in a rather soft and beautiful looking plumage of brown, layered feathers with ivory-white countershading. The obviously male creature is half-erect as he cocks his avian head to the side appraisingly, and you swear you can see a lecherous grin stretching across his beak as he leaps forward to attack.";

Within a minute, he shudders, his cock twitching as he covers your beaten form with his sticky white seed.

				say "Giving in to your new hawk-like instincts you spread your wings out and take to the air, the feel of the cool air whistling over your soft feathers feels amazing as you begin your first awkward flight over the city. It isn't long before you have managed to master the use of your new wings however, and are soaring easily over the city and enjoying the sights of the world spread out below you. Of course your first flight doesn't go unnoticed, and you soon have several handsome male hawks circling you teasingly, their beautiful feathers and virile male bodies speaking to something within you as you alter your flight path to give them teasing glimpses of your own sexy feathered body. Several of the hawks vie for your attention for a while, but you are eventually drawn to a rather handsome specimen who has a lovely way of slipping through the air with ease, and soon find yourself following him through the air back to his nest on top of one of the buildings in the area. Already aroused from your flight, he has no trouble in getting you to spread yourself for him, and he wastes no time in mounting you and making you screech your pleasure to the sky as he takes you again and again. [line break]";
				say "You lose track of what time it is, and eventually even what day it is, as your handsome hawk mates you often, keeping you nice and happy, feeding you and making sure you are well taken care of, even as he ensures you are unable to even think about leaving your new shared nest. Almost before you know it you can feel your belly swelling large with your new mate's seed, and you realize you are now a properly claimed and bred hawkwoman, which for some reason seems strangely satisfying to your new instincts. Soon you lay your first clutch of lovely little hawk eggs, the feeling of their ovoid shapes slipping out of your new sex is absolutely amazing, and before you know it you are panting happily in your egg filled nest with your mate looking on proudly. You find you can hardly wait for your eggs to grow and hatch into even more lovely hawks, and look forward to the happy event enthusiastically even as your new avian mate works on filling your eager body with a fresh clutch of eggs for you to lay... And you find yourself looking forward more than ever to the many breedings and clutches of eggs to come, as you fully embrace your new life as a slutty hawkwoman with a lovely belly full of life...";

				say "Giving in to your strong new hawk-like instincts, you spread your wings and take to the sky for the first time, enjoying the feeling of freedom as you slowly begin to master the skies above the infected city. Before long you are soaring through the skies with ease, and enjoying the feel of the wind rushing over your feathers as your eyes scan the city below for someone to play with. Unfortunately, the city is full of other infected, and most of the people have already become playtoys already, which leaves you flying aimlessly through the skies, until you realize that you are being silly. Looking up at the open skies around you, you can feel a grin tugging at your beak as you begin to angle your wings to take you down the coast a ways. There is after all a whole wide world out there full of people you can chase and catch. And the open skies are calling out to you as you head off in search of new places to hunt, and new partners to share the joys of flight with. Let the military do with the city as they wish, you find yourself thinking as you fly under the cover of the night sky, you have the world out there to play in...";

			say "When the military rescues you from the city, you find yourself watched closely by their scientists, as they seem fascinated by your new avian form, and the changes in your muscle density and bone mass. Their attention makes you nervous, and before long you are asking to leave, especially once they start talking about bone marrow samples and similar painful tests. Fortunately enough, they are soon far too busy dealing with the fallout from the city and some of the other infected who they 'rescued' that are causing problems in camp to devote full attention to you for very long, and soon enough you are released. Wandering around outside of the city, you soon find your new looks gathering quite a bit of attention, though they certainly aren't very helpful in finding a job of some sort. Eventually you manage to get a job as a mail courier, and while it is rather dull delivering the mail and packages most days, it does let you meet some rather interesting people. One day you even meet a fellow avian, a sexy black [one of]hawkman[or]tengu[or]eagle[or]gryphon[at random], the powerful male is more than happy to meet you as well, and while both of you have never given yourself over to your new instincts enough to master your new wings and fly, you still find the draw of meeting a fellow avian to be nearly irresistible. [if Player is female]Before long the two of you are inseparable, and it isn't much longer before you are expecting your first clutch of eggs, and you find yourself eagerly anticipating seeing just how they will look when they finally hatch, and looking forward to many more clutches of eggs in the future[else]After a few months and becoming friends, he introduces you to his sister, who was similarly infected.
