Description of Harold is "     Standing behind the bar is a well-built and rather horse-like man, obviously an experienced bartender by the way he handles himself as he dishes out drinks to the patrons. His slightly hoof-like hands not seeming to slow him down at all. A black leather vest resting against his pure white fur makes him look even more striking due to the sharp contrast of colors. Even more striking however is the spiraling horn emerging from the center of the equine's forehead. Its pearlescent sheen catching and reflecting the colored lights of the club, and making it seem to shimmer and burn with a small rainbow of color every time the unicorn bartender moves his head. Catching you looking in his direction, the equine barkeep winks at you and gestures to an open spot at the bar, obviously inviting you to come talk, even as the shining unicorn puts together another drink for one of the strippers.".

		say "     'Hey there, newcomer, the name's Harold,' the large unicorn says with a smile on his equine muzzle as he leans forward on the bar and stretches out a hand to welcome you. 'Good to see another friendly face around here, especially one that isn't [']too friendly['], if you know what I mean,' Harold says with a chuckling nicker of laughter. 'I'm sure you have bumped into plenty of [']too friendly['] beasts out there already.' He nods knowingly at you as you shake his rather large hoof-like hand. 'Had my own encounter with one, as I'm sure you can tell already. Though strangely enough, it was a horse and not a unicorn that played 'hide the horn' with me.' Harold winks at you as he says this, resting his arms easily on the bar as a fond grin crosses his equine muzzle. 'Dunno why I ended up like this instead of a horse myself, but it does have some benefits - main one of which is that I seem to have kept my sanity while a buncha the others lost it,' the unicorn says with a shrug, before leaning close and saying in a lower tone of voice. 'The secondary benefit, of course, is what I ended up [']hung like['], if ya get what I'm saying,' Harold whispers teasingly for your ears only. His ribald statement makes you smile with amusement, even as you find yourself growing slightly aroused.";

'I think she mentioned something about going downtown to check out some overgrown flower gardens she'd spotted. I'm starting to get a little worried. You might want to head down to the high rise district and see if she's in an [bold type]overrun garden[roman type] around there. Just be careful if you do.";
	else if Haroldtalk is 1:
		say "     'Hey there again, been thinking about you actually,' the large unicorn bartender says with a smile as you sit down at the bar. 'I see you still wander around the city a lot, while most of us stick close to safety,' Harold says with a slight questioning tone to his voice. The unicorn smiles as you nod in response and continues, 'Perfect! I was hoping you would say that. See I was wondering what happened to a friend of mine out there, and I was hoping you could go check on them for me if you had some spare time?' Harold asks you hopefully. Do you offer to help the bartender find his friend?";
		if Player consents:
			say "     'Great! You see she runs a little tattoo and piercing parlor not too far away, and while I managed to find my way here safely, I haven't heard a thing about her since before things started going crazy,' Harold says with a sad, whickering sigh. 'Of course with the mess the red light district is in, it would be pretty damn hard for me to go look myself. Even if I do seem to be resistant to other changes, there are plenty of creatures out there that don't think twice about taking captives, and the streets are such a mess it could be a pain finding the place again, even though I have been there plenty of times before,' the unicorn stallion says with another sigh before a grin spreads across his equine face, his horn shining as he nods at you happily. 'Which is where you come in, since I imagine you can find out for me if she is still OK out there, and maybe let her know her favorite bartender is all right and where to come for a drink as well,' he says as he claps you on the shoulder happily before giving you some directions on what to look for. It looks like you are off to the red light district next!";

After explaining that his friend obviously headed out into the city in search of much-needed supplies, and never managed to return, you inform the unhappy unicorn that it is likely some of the creatures in the city managed to get their hands on her, and she is quite possibly just as sex crazed as any other member of whatever species she ended up as. Seeing the dejected look on the equine barkeepers face, you sigh and say you will continue to keep an eye out for her in the city, though it isn't likely you will recognize her if she has changed too much. Harold nods, and promises to think about the problem for a bit to see if he can come up with something to help you find her, before the powerful unicorn goes back to tending the bar.";

He wanders off into a narrow back room for a while, only to return with a small pouch full of some unknown items. 'Well, here ya go. These should be what ya want. Gave ya all of the stock I was saving, since I didn't know how much you would need.

The horned equine curls a finger begging you closer before he himself leans down to whisper something into your ear.

Letting the other man know that you'll see what you can do, you receive a somber nod from Harold before the bartender pulls himself to stand in his usual upright position back behind his bar. 'OK.

Looking at what the unicorn hands you, you find yourself in possession of a good number of freecred.

The unusual, yet delightful, taste of the drink has you quickly draining the glass, enjoying the way the rum and vanilla spiced milk goes down easily, yet still leaves you thirsty for more. Setting your glass back down on the bar, you grin with amusement as you note that the canny bartender has anticipated your request, and another glass full of the creamy liquid has already been set out on the bar for you. Saluting him again with your glass, you drink some more of the strangely flavored milk as you enjoy the sights of the busy club. A pleasant buzz starts to set in, even as you realize that your body is beginning to change slightly. Though, in your mildly inebriated state, it is hard to think why that would be a problem.";
