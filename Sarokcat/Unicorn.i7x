Section 1 - Creature Responses

to say Unicorn attack:
	if Player is female:
		say "Stop... Haroldtime.[line break]";
		say ".'";
		infect "Unicorn";
	else:
		say ".[line break]";
		say "ment...";
		infect "Unicorn";

To say Unicorn loss:
	say "     Knocking the unicorn to the ground, you once again show that brute force can triumph over speed and precision, her lithe sprinter's body not able to take the punishment you can dish out. She scrambles away from your vicious assault, all four paws scrabbling helplessly along the ground for a second, before managing to find traction. You sigh as she darts away. Even moving as slowly and painfully as she now is, you know she is still far too fast for you to catch. You watch her as she leaves, the unicorn, constantly shooting nervous glances back at you until she is out of sight.'";

"Unicorn Infection"	"Infection"	""	Unicorn Infection rule	1000	false

This is the Unicorn Infection rule:
	if Player has a body of "Unicorn":
		trigger ending "Unicorn Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			if Player is female:
				say "     Surrendering to your new powerful herd instincts, you quickly make your way back to your handsome stallion at the bar. The sight of his strong powerful form as you return to the palomino makes you moan with desire as you realize that you need to be his. Harold grins with amusement as you stalk forward on your sexy new silvery hooves, his horn shimmering comfortingly in the light as you quickly slip behind the bar, and surrender yourself to your stallion where everyone can watch. The unicorn stud claims you thoroughly much to the cheers of several of the patrons, and you find yourself lost in lustful pleasure as you orgasm again and again while the lights and music pulse around you. Eventually your stud needs to return to serving drinks for a while, and once you have managed to recover somewhat from your claiming, you happily move to help. Soon your naked unicorn body is draped with silver necklaces and a sexy leather vest of your own, hanging open in the front to give your stallion easy access to your pert pink nipples, and you have become just as much of a fixture behind the bar as he is. Your regular sex shows with your mate continue to get rave reviews, and you are more than happy to invite a few other curious customers to come join you, and while most of them stick to their drinks, you find yourself grinning when several unsuspecting soldiers come in and start hitting on you. Harold grins and gives you a wink as you serve them some of his 'special' unicorn reserve, and you look forward to helping your stallion tame several new mares soon enough...";
			else:
				say "     Giving in to your new powerful unicorn instincts, you soon find yourself prowling the streets hunting for some lovely women to lure off and make your own, and while you almost return to the palomino several times to hunt there, the scent of another established stallion has you backing off automatically. Your hunt through the city is both easy, and fruitless, since while few creatures can resist your mighty new body, or the hypnotic shimmer of your horn, there are also few if any humans left to transform. Before long though, the military begins to push into the city, providing you with an entirely new group of humans to tempt, and you enjoy walking into their squads, and picking one of them out to transform while the rest of them stare at your beautiful white coat and shimmering horn with awe. It isn't long before you have a selection of the choicest mares following you happily through the city, which now seems to be growing more and more confining by the day as the combat intensifies. Eventually you head through the military lines and out of the city into the bright and welcoming forest, none of the soldiers so much as lifting a gun in your direction as you and your mares prance by while they gawk at your beauty. As you settle in to your new forest you find yourself surprisingly content as you and your small herd wanders your new territory, though as word begins to spread about unicorns wandering the world again, your little forest begins to get a small amount of tourist traffic heading through as well. Some of the tourists even manage to leave after catching a glimpse of your herd, being of little interest to you, more often though, they are hypnotized by your shimmering beauty, and practically beg to be your mare, a blessing you are more than happy to give them...";
		else:
			if Player is male:
				say "     When the military finally retrieve you from the city, many of your erstwhile rescuers are in awe of your handsome form and mythical countenance. A fact that you quite quickly put to use as you convince them that like the unicorn of legend you are no real threat to them, and should be let go as soon as possible. It goes to show how few of them actually read the older versions of the legends, as the quickly release you, though several of them stare at you with longing as you leave the camp behind you. Once free of the military's interference however, it is easy enough for you to head to the nearest town, and begin looking for a way to make your fortune. Your beautiful new form and your shimmering horn make it easy to get a decent job, and you find that people are more than willing to confide in you and trust you quite easily now. This works to your advantage as you quickly capitalize on the situation, with promotion and raises coming easily, as well as an ever increasing group of unicorn groupies who begin to gather to follow you around and stare at your beautiful form. Feeling deeply amused, you even begin to charge some of the more attractive and pure of the groupies for the privilege of becoming your mare, something that soon has more and more people clamoring for your attention. Soon you have plenty of money with which to buy a nice little wooded estate a bit out of the city for you and your slowly growing herd of unicorns, and you enjoy the feel of the wind in your hair as you play on the wooded banks of your stream with several of your lovely mares, and whicker with amusement at how eager people are these days for the touch of a unicorn... and how much fun it can be for you to give them that touch...";
			else:
				say "     You are wonderfully happy once the military finally arrives, and glad to be leaving the city, and though you get a number of awed stares from the soldiers, you are much more interested in the thought of being able to run and roam safely wherever you choose. It isn't long before the scientists release you to do so either, unable to bear the thought of running intrusive tests on your splendid new body. As you walk out into the world on your shining silver hooves, you find yourself smiling happily as your horn seems to shimmer with amusement as well, catching everyone's eye and making them sigh with awe. It is easy enough to realize just how useful your new form will be in finding yourself a comfortable new position now that you are outside the city, especially with the near mesmeric powers your horn seems happy to display. Deciding to enjoy things to the fullest you soon begin looking for a good job, and a good candidate to make into a unicorn stud for you to play with as well, your enhanced libido and slightly submissive tendencies desiring a nice stallion to tease and tempt. Soon enough you find both, as you encounter a handsome young CEO at one of the luxury parties you are often invited too due to your unique new look. It isn't long before you get the rich young man all to yourself off to the side and offer him a chance at a new life with you, a chance he wastes no time in accepting. You take time to make sure his transformation isn't going to raise any questions about his identity, before the two of you go off for a week and enjoy each other's body in every way possible. Soon the handsome new unicorn stud is back at work amongst the envious looks of his subordinates, while you are settling in happily with your burning heat finally sated for the season.";
