You inspect the plaque and find that this was actually once the hyena enclosure. Well, now you know where all the hyenas wandering the city came from, and here you thought it was just the natural evolution of scavengers into scavenging hyenas. As you are about to leave, you gleam from the 'fun facts' section that the hyena has one of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom, strong enough even to chew through metal. You resolve to be more careful next time you face one of the cackling beasts.";

Unfortunately, he is stranded in the middle of one of the more open enclosures, standing on a rock in what appears to be a lake of cum. You blink at the sheer amount of the stuff coating the area, but you are distracted by some rough slapping sounds underneath the hoarse cries of the trapped employee.";
	say "     Looking around, you are shocked to spot two massive mounds of gray flesh going at it not far away, their sheer size making it hard to recognize them as the human-like herm elephants they are instead of, say, small buildings. You find yourself gaping at the ridiculous size of the one on the bottom's cock, then clap your hands to your ears as they both trumpet, the one on top erupting into the one on bottom, and the one on bottom erupting everywhere. The trapped employee moans as the lake of seed around him rises even higher. The elephant herms take a minute to rest before switching positions and starting up all over again.";
	say "     Sadly, you really don't see any way you can reach the employee to help with anything short of a helicopter, and you certainly aren't up to taking on two large foes of that size. Shaking your head, you move off into the zoo, trying not to shudder at the soon-to-be-elephantine employee's cries.";

The smell of snakes and sex fills the area, and their hissing is only broken by the occasional moan or cry of ecstasy, proving that there are a few non-snakes caught up in their mating knot as well, though you are sure they're soon to transform. Carefully, you back away from the door, not desiring to get caught up in their mating frenzy, though it could be fun to try if there were fewer of them...";

Unfortunately, it seems several other people or creatures were here before you, and it is obvious not much [']resting['] occurred, although several of the participants were probably horizontal at one point. Looking around, you survey the splatters of cum from several unidentified participants, several articles of shed clothing tossed around haphazardly, and a variety of mixed animal prints tracked in the dirt. You really aren't sure just who all or what all enjoyed themselves here, but they definitely had a lot of fun. Sighing, you leave without taking a rest, the scene making you too nervous, and aroused, to stay there any longer.";

Picking them up, you begin to leaf through them.";

	say "     'Holy shit! If anyone is reading this, I found the grizzly, and watch out, he seems to be a size larger than he was yesterday! And god if he doesn't seem to be smarter now, too! I locked him out of the shed, and I should be safe in here.'";
	say "     'I don't know what the bear is up to out there, but there was a lot of grunting just a minute ago, and there is a strange smell in here now. It smells kinda... good. For some reason the shack seems to be a size too small now, though...'";

You back off out of sight of the panda as it trots past, seemingly intent on moving as fast as it can down the path.";
	say "     You are about to come out of hiding when another, more bestial panda comes barreling down the path. This one is obviously female, and it quickly chases after the retreating male panda. The second panda is swiftly followed by two more female pandas, each batting at each other as they try to get ahead, and finally one last slightly pandalike female trailing along after everyone else, the final one still kicking off its encumbering clothing as it continues to change into a full panda. Amused at the strange situation, you wait to make sure there aren't any more girl pandas chasing after the obviously very popular guy panda before coming out of hiding and continuing on your way.";

Entering the petting zoo, you are only slightly surprised to find the area empty. More surprising is the large amount of children's clothing and a number of backpacks scattered around on the ground. Obviously, there was a school bus visiting the area at some point recently. You sigh as you look around, then give a halfhearted search of the backpacks lying around. You find several items of food and water and decide to take them with you. It doesn't count as taking candy from kids if they aren't around, does it?";

Taking a closer look at the VCR, you notice that it's labelled [']Animal Handling Training[']. Feeling curious, you push play and settle down to watch a bit. Soon you are caught up in all the tips and tricks the training tape teaches to aspiring zookeepers on how to handle the animals and deal with any trouble. By the time the tape clicks off an hour later, you find yourself feeling much more confident about your ability to deal with any animals or beasts that you might come across.";

Still deciding there might be something useful to you in the bag, you begin to sort through the various supplies inside. Strangely most of what seems to be contained within is a variety of animal hormone shots, and treatments for either male or female animals depending. You think you could probably inject yourself with some of the animal hormone boosters, and the extra hormones could help you maintain your gender identity... but should you really be using medicine designed for animals? Do you inject yourself?";

Deciding to take a look inside, you can see the security station has several monitors that appear to be working at a glance, although some of them appear to be playing on a loop. Moving into the small security area, you note that it smells like bestial sex in here, leaving no doubt as to why the security station was broken into, the rich musky scent makes your body tingle with lust, and you realize you can't stay in here for long without becoming even more aroused than usual. Still there might be something of use in here, you think as you search the small monitoring room, you find your eyes continually drawn to the monitors however, as the action on the screen repeats itself over and over. Soon you stop even trying to search the area, and are just watching intently, as a cheetah woman teases a zoo intruder into becoming her male mate, and the scene as a pair of wolftaurs burst out of the bathroom and run down some of the zoo paths, before the male catches the female and begins to mate her like an animal. Other scenes of sex and transformation are played out on the monitors in front of you, but you manage to pull yourself away from the sexual scene and scents, and stagger out of the Security booth. Somehow sure that if you had stayed much longer, you would have stayed there watching the sexual scenes and growing increasingly aroused until one of the beasts in the zoo managed to find you in there, and given how aroused you already are.. by that point you might not even have fought whatever strong sexual beast came to take you...

Behind the foliage, you can see the back of one of the animal enclosures, a nice thick area of fence designed to keep the animals inside. Of course in this case you can see how this group of animals got out, as the fence has been broken and torn here where it isn't easily visible, leaving more than enough room for someone, or something, to slip into or out of the enclosure. Examining the edges of the fence, you find yourself more than a little worried about encountering something able to do that kind of damage to the special cage fences, and you decide to move along down the pathway quickly, just in case it might still be in the area.";

You hold your breath as the small stampede passes, only letting it out after they have all passed by safely, sighing with relief as you step out of your impromptu hiding place.

You feel your cheeks heating up even as you try to hold your breath, your eyes fixed on his large sheath even as the spotted Leopardman slowly shifts into the next tree. You watch with a mixture of fascination and a strange desire as the sleek feline stretches up from his position in his newest tree, until he can grip the top of the zoo wall easily. You blink as in one swift movement the lithe Leopard hauls himself onto the top of the wall, before sliding down out of sight on the other side.";

As you do so, you notice that the slot that dispenses pictures seems to have a strip already in it, and curious, you pull the strip of pictures out.";
	say "     Blinking, you stare down as a handsome young teenager poses against an African background, a zebra close behind him. The next picture shows the young man turning as the zebra puts its head on his shoulder, an actual zebraman that appears to have been hiding in the booth. The next several shots show in full color detail the zebra stallion pinning the changing man up against the side of the photo booth, as his body lengthens and is covered in stripes. The final photo is a wonderfully done photo of a zebra stallion mounting an eager zebra mare with a lewd smile on his snout.";
	say "     You shudder as you realize how lucky you are to arrive here late. If you had been the first person into that booth, there would have been no way for you to escape or fight in such a confined space.
