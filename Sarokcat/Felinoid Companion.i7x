You pant and moan underneath his sexy form, his musk filling your mind as he takes you like a good little mate, and the thought of being a true and proper mate to this magnificent feline instead of just a traveling companion makes you moan in glee as you clutch his body tighter.  Soon you can feel his seed filling your body, and making you cry out in orgasm as the burning need to be bred is quenched by the feel of his seed filling your fertile passage up to the brim.  You groan as he pulls himself out of you, padding a few steps away before twisting around to lick his cock clean, you sigh as you recover from your powerful orgasm, half wishing he would come put that tongue to use on you as well[impregchance].";

As the large beast turns and begins to stalk towards you intently, you realize that he must smell just how needy and heat filled you are, and is looking to take advantage of it. You try to step back, only to realize that your body doesn[apostrophe]t want to move away from the handsome cat as he stalks forward and buries his head in your crotch, making you moan and pant like an animal as his soft tongue licks over your needy lips teasingly.

Soon you are gasping as your pussy floods with your juices, your orgasm washing over you even as the handsome felinoid continues to lap up every drop it can reach.  You pant as the large beast steps back, collapsing to the ground as your shaky legs try to slip out from under you, looking up from here you can see your wonderful companion has twisted himself around and is now licking at his own erect cock.

The beast rumbles in approval above you, and you shudder in pleasure at being such a good mate for your companion, licking his rod several more times, before taking it into your mouth and sucking eagerly. The already aroused feline doesn[apostrophe]t last long under your assault, yowling above you as his wonderful flavor explodes in your mouth, his delicious seed filling your mouth up even faster then you can swallow it down. Groaning the big cat over you collapses to his side as you lift your head off his spent cock, the incredibly erotic sight of the large cat you just sucked lying there fills your eyes as you lick your lips, the taste of his wonderful seed still filling your mouth even as you begin to try to gather your wits about you";

Glancing at the sleek golden feline stalking nearby, you find yourself daydreaming about being more then just companions, the thought of you underneath the powerful male beast as he claims you as his lusty pet filling your mind with eager desire.

The golden furred beast wastes no more time in accepting your wanton invitation, his soft chest fur rubbing over your back as he settles himself onto your body, his hips thrusting forward eagerly as he sheathes his barbed cock in your body. Your eyes roll back in pleasure as you brace yourself against the ground, your world narrowing down to the amazing feel of his spined cock teasing your passage with every powerful bestial thrust of his hips. Soon you can feel your body shuddering underneath the masterful feline in pleasure, your orgasm just barely out of reach as he takes you like an animal.  Finally you gasp as you feel his strong jaws teasing the back of your neck, his seed flooding into you and triggering your own mind blowing orgasm, the pleasure so intense you black out for a minute.

Your wanton actions speaking to the large felinoids instincts, the beast wastes no time pinning you to the ground, making you moan as his soft fur covers your body, even as his cock spears into your heat filled loins. You feel a smile crossing your face as he thrusts into you eagerly, feeling the two of you become even closer as you become something more then just companions as his seed fills your eager body.

Sensing your resistance to his advances fade, the beast above you rumbles approvingly as he settles himself properly on top of you, wasting no more time on foreplay as he pushes himself into your eager body.

Overwhelmed with pleasure, you collapse underneath him, more then willing to let the large beast finish filling you with his fertile seed, your mind scattering to the winds as he breeds you properly. Eventually he pulls out, and you slowly begin to recover from the amazingly pleasurable ordeal, blushing as you realize just how wantonly you behaved underneath the large cat. Standing up to gather your equipment, you realize that at least the burning need in your loins has been quenched completely, replaced with the pleasant soreness of a well fucked female, and the extremely pleasant sensation of his seed still swirling around inside your body.

Leaving your new female well seeded by the both of you, you take advantage of your new knowledge to slip into one of their vehicles at night, the two of you hiding inside until it loads up fully in the morning. Your feline grin as the people in the APC begin to moan and change matches that of your hunting companions, as you stalk out of hiding while the needy soldiers begin to strip.  By the time the APC reaches the city and the driver comes back to open the doors, every male soldier is now a female cat, with at least one load of seed from you or your friend in their bellies.  The driver's panicked look before he too succumbs to the scent of sex and feline musk, as your new mates hold him down while you rub your bodies over him, is priceless. Soon you have a lovely large group of soon to be pregnant felinoids all your own, and are definitely making plans for returning the APC to the military - properly scent marked, of course.  You wouldn[apostrophe]t want the next group of soldiers to arrive in the city unprepared to be mated, now would you?[line break]";

They seem even more worried about your felinoid companion, but after all you went through to save him before, you aren[apostrophe]t about to let them hurt your handsome male friend now. The soldiers seem somewhat bemused at your verbal tongue lashing, before escorting the two of you back to the military camp for the few survivors. Several of the scientists try to check you to make sure neither of you are infectious, but you manage to keep them from looking too closely at either of you, the doctors finding both you and your mate to be very persuasive once they have a good whiff of your musk. Released from the camp as soon as possible back into the outside world, you sigh as you try to figure out what to do now, your new feline form not terribly suited to modern life. Deciding to try rural life instead, the two of you move to a smaller town, where you can both have some room to stretch your legs and run a bit, your neighbors somewhat wary of the strange new arrivals, but they manage to accept you soon enough.  The male felines presence makes it hard for you to focus sometimes, and more often then not you find yourself succumbing to the handsome cats charms, yowling in pleasure eagerly as he mounts you.  Eventually you can see several members of the town beginning to grow curious about the two of you, especially when you wander around town with your mates musk on you. After a while you find yourself inviting several of the more curious back to your house, where they can learn more about the two of you, of course trapped in the room coated in your mates scent, they are soon learning about what being a felinoid is like on their own four paws. You find yourself grinning as you send some of the newly enthusiastic felinoids to let their friends know they should come visit you as well, as you realize what an opportunity you have to make this town a nice safe haven for you and your mate.  Before long, every family in town soon has at least one felinoid as part of their household, and as you feel your belly growing large with your mate's cubs, you realize you finally have managed to make yourself a nice safe town to raise them up in.  You knew you would just come to love small town life...";

The fact that you can still talk seeming to calm them down immensely as they bring you back to the camp to be sorted out with the few other survivors. Overhearing some of the people talk about the tests they plan on running on the two of you, you decide to just slip out together instead, your friend pouncing and changing two soldiers to take your places in the holding area, while the two of you slip out and to freedom.  Once back out in the regular world, you realize your forms don[apostrophe]t make surviving easy, making it hard to hold most any job since it is hard for you to manipulate things carefully with your leonine form.  Fortunately for you both, your scent and your handsome looks are more then enough to enchant most women, and many men as well for the short time they remain male anyways, it makes them more then happy enough to lend you a place to stay for a night, or even the use of their bodies for the night as well. You begin to enjoy yourself more and more as you travel from place to place, your new form seeming so much better to you then your old one, and while you never lose yourself to your instincts fully like your companion, you certainly enjoy your nights with the many human women who crouch underneath you.  The two of you traveling together from place to place and leaving a string of well fucked human and freshly changed felinoid women behind you, their bellies sure to grow nice and round with proof of your virility even as you move on to the next town.  You find you enjoy the challenge of constantly staying ahead of any of the authorities who would try to stop you or contain the spread of what they call infection, your predatory instincts rising to the challenge easily.  Eventually they do manage to catch up to you, but by that point your offspring all over the country are already causing more then enough trouble that you are soon able to escape again. As you continue your traveling life through a changing country, you feel a feral grin stretch your muzzle as you realize you managed to find the two of you the best happy ending ever, the kind that keeps on going you think as you eagerly stalk forward to find your next conquest.";

You feel rather proud of once more having saved your new friend, as you take him with you to set up your new life in the outside world.

You take your Felinoid friend to see a nice male vet to see if anything can be done, only to find that after only a minute in the room with your companions strong male musk, the male vet is on his way to being a female feline. The erotic sight of watching the former male being mounted by your friend turns you on so much you end up orgasming several times just watching, sneaking your pet back out of the Vets, you decide to have some more fun with this, hitting several different bars most nights, and bringing the unsuspecting men who hit on you the most home with you. You enjoy watching as your companions makes the horny men into equally horny women, changing their viewpoint on life drastically, some of them you even let your Felinoid companion change fully into female cats for him to breed.  This forces you to move several times before you finally settle down someplace to stay for good, you and your companion settling in happily, while a strange explosion of pregnant female Felinoids hits the area, even as your own belly begins to show signs of his fertility...";

You enjoy how easily woman flock to you when you wear even a hint of musk, but the most amusing discovery is when you bring a friend home to meet him, and discover your male friend is soon a woman. You have great fun with this ability of your companion, turning several men who annoy you into women instead, you even let your companion finish changing several of them all the way into female felines for his own amusement.  Strangely you still seem resistant to the transformative effects of being around him, retaining your manhood even as others lose theirs, as a side benefit, most of the ones your companion change seem strangely submissive as well, making your life much easier. Soon you both have managed to acquire a small harem of women, both felinoid and human to play with as you start your new lives.";
