Wondering what could be so dangerous, you note someone has scribbled a small note underneath a sign telling you about the wing, the note reads.  'Do NOT open, really, I mean it, seriously you don[']t want to go in there, its not fun, its not pretty, so just turn around and leave now, while you can!, signed- Val.'  Deciding to take the signs advice, you turn around to leave, as you do you find yourself wondering what could be so dangerous about a 'Modern Art' exhibit?, ";

After admiring the painting for a minute, you turn to leave, only catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye, looking around you don[']t see anything that could have made the movement, though as your eye falls on the painting, you swear the hunt is closer to catching the fleeing people, and was the hunt leader staring right at you with his glowing red eyes before?  Deciding it might be better not to think about that, you continue quickly on your way, feeling almost hunted yourself.";
	Now Moving painting is resolved;


Section 3- Updating artwork

Updating artwork is a situation.
The sarea of Updating artwork is "Museum";

Instead of Resolving a Updating artwork:
	say "Wandering along the peaceful museum hallways, you take time to glance at some of the paintings hanging along the wall, only to stop and stare around you in shock.  It appears someone has gone around with some paint and markers, and 'updated' several of these valuable antiques, putting in glasses, mustaches, and funny hats on the characters within.  Perhaps worst of all, you can see that all of the male subjects now have rather large genitalia painted on in lewd colours, and to add insult to injury, a closer inspection reveals that many of the cocks the unknown artist added, are more suitable to animals then humans!  Sighing at the absolute waste, you continue on your way down the hall, although after a while you are forced to admit, that at least in the case of some of the artists, the new 'updates' are actually an improvement. ";

This was obviously the site of a massive party at some point recently, and from the looks of things was a great revel while it lasted, unfortunately the participants seem to have finally passed out where they stood, or lay in some cases. Proving that even satyrs have their limits.  You step lightly among the passed out bodies as you continue along your way, careful not to wake any of them from their no doubt much needed rest.";

The sarea of Strange drums is "Museum";

Instead of Resolving a Strange drums:
	say "Wandering the museum hallways, you are surprised to hear the sound of strange tribal drums echoing through the halls.

Reading the little plaque you realize that the sabretooth tigers are missing, glancing around you note that all the sabretooths from the area appear to be missing. You quickly hurry to leave the area, just as a strange thought hits you, weren[']t the sabre-like teeth a primarily male characteristic, like a lions mane? If that[']s the case, you worry about what they will do to get a female....";

You can[']t help but gawk at the size of the thing, its haft a good four feet long, and the blade almost another two feet long and two feet wide on each side.  You try lifting the large weapon for a second, but can[']t even manage to budge the massive thing, leaving it where it lies, you hurry on, hoping not to meet whatever kind of creature uses a weapon like that.";

The sarea of Missing lamp is "Museum";

Instead of Resolving a Missing lamp:
	say "Wandering the museum hallways, you come across a display showing an ancient cave full of treasure, with a old arabian style lamp displayed in the center.  The strange thing is, someone seems to have broken into the display and taken the lamp instead of the rest of the treasure, you don[']t suppose they believe in the old tale of a genies lamp do you?";
