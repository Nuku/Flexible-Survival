				say "Finally giving in to the dark primal urges within, you swiftly return to the shop in the mall, Nermine welcoming you back eagerly as you pin her to the counter, and fuck her again and again. She eagerly submits to your needs, your strong jackal-like body and male musk making you irresistible to the strange shopkeeper, as with every strong thrust of your canine cock you make her even more subservient to your will. Eventually sated, you enjoy looking around your new shop with amusement, while your new little jackal fucktoy licks your paws eagerly. An evil grin stretches across your jackal muzzle as you ponder all the amusement this store full of unusual treasures could bring you. You and Nermine quickly pack up her shop as the military close in, and she shows you how to change the location of the store, soon you are setting up in a lovely and unsuspecting college town. The foolish students are soon flocking to your store to buy all sorts of strange and unusual transformative trinkets, and you are more than happy to have your pet shopkeep sell them to them. The amusing sights of the people who fail to use the items carefully make you and Nermine laugh heartily, as you both begin to enjoy the game of seeing how badly your customers can misuse the items, enjoying their new forms immensely. Some few manage to 'win' by being careful and using their purchases responsibly, and those few you often give even nicer toys to as a reward, some of them you even reward personally by making them into your own personal pets. When the military comes to investigate the strange outbreak of infection in the town, they find your shop already gone, moved on to a new town already, and looking forward to a long and enjoyable existence with your lovely pet jackalwoman...";
			else:
				say "Finally giving in to your darker desires, you quickly head back to the strange shop and the shopkeeper you know so well. Nermine greets you eagerly as you return, and is soon on her knees before you like a good little submissive as you pet her head. You enjoy reveling in her submission for several moments, her body helpless to resist the strong urges you bring out in her, you are about to take her to the back room to enjoy your new pet fully, when the door jingles as someone walks in. You look around to see who it is, only to gasp as an amazingly arousing scent washes over you, making you feel both incredibly horny and submissive at the same time. 'Ah here you both are,' the jackal headed man from before says as he looks at the two of you with a grin on his muzzle. You find yourself moaning as you drop to your knees next to Nermine, realizing that that wonderful dominant scent is coming from the jackalman, making your pussy clench with a deep need that you know only he can fulfill.";
				say "Seeing your reaction, the jackal headed man grins as he pets you with one of his clawed hands, sending pleasure shooting through your body at his touch. 'Surely you didn't think I used all of that mixture on your little ankh?' he says in a teasing voice, 'Not when I have been waiting so very long to see this one on her knees before me like this?' the jackal man says as he gestures at Nermine. 'And now I get to have you too as a bonus,' he says in amusement. He takes your paw and Nermine's and leads you both into the back room. You find yourself almost wanting to protest as he pushes you both down onto the mattress, but his strong powerful scent, and dominant attitude soon has your body responding eagerly to his touches, as it goes into heat for this strong male jackal. He breeds both you and Nermine deep into the night, and for several days following, the two of you writhing underneath him in turn, as he fills you both up with his divinely amazing seed.";
				say "You are unable to resist his scent and touches as he masters your mind and tames your body to his touch, his soft suggestions of how a proper little jackal-woman should be settling into your mind like commands, as he ensures your obedience now and forever. Eventually he leaves the two of you lying there together in the back room of the shop, two well-fucked jackalwomen panting like animals. When the two of you eventually come back to your senses, you realize that you look just like Nermine does, and this fact seems to please you on some deep level, since your powerful mate likes you like this. Soon you and Nermine reopen the shop, the other jackalwoman being slightly submissive towards you still, even though you both know that you are really both pets for the more powerful jackalman. The shop open, you both take turns manning the counter, and selling all sorts of strange and unusual items to the unsuspecting populace outside the city, often amused at how they fail to read the instructions or take care when using dangerous transformative magic. Running the shop becomes more of a chore as you and Nermine both soon begin to show signs that your night with the wonderful Jackal man was productive, your bellies swelling large with his offspring. The feeling of his children growing in your belly makes you both smile eagerly as you wait for them to be born, looking forward both to the children themselves, but to his promises of the many more breedings to come...";

Quickly released from military custody due to your persuasive ways and dominant manner, you soon begin looking around for your place in the outside world. Discarding most regular jobs as beneath you at this point, you begin picking up strange odd jobs, and hunting down rare items for your contacts. While not all of the items you retrieve for people may necessarily have been retrieved legally, you don't really mind, in fact that just makes it all the more challenging. Soon you are rather well off money wise, with a nice little collection of rare items of your own, and you stop taking jobs for just the money, demanding your clients service you in whatever manner you wish before you retrieve their items. Occasionally some of them try to evade your terms, especially the men, agreeing and then trying to talk their way out of it, these fools learn not to mess with you, as you demonstrate that even outside of the city, you still retain the ability to alter others forms. These clients quickly become your favorite pets, once transformed into submissive little jackal women for your pleasure, also serving as a lesson to others about trying to cheat you. Strangely enough, sometimes even the clients you only enjoy for several nights become so addicted to your jackal body they ask to join your harem of pets, and you certainly don't refuse them. You occasionally wonder how Nermine is doing in her shop that started it all, but for the most part are more than happy living your new life as a rich and powerful modern day lord...";

				say "When the rescue comes, you remember all you have learned from survival in the city and your time working with mysterious items, and use that knowledge to secure a number of valuable items from the city and smuggle them out when you are rescued. Once outside, you retrieve the unique and generally impossible to find items, and quickly open up a small shop of your own in a large city, advertising items from within the city to an elect clientele. Your business, while secret to most, is a booming success, selling the infectious samples of creatures from within the city to those who want to try being something more unusual. Though usually your items are purchased with the intent to turn someone else, usually a rival, into a little sexpet for the buyer, you don't generally care too much, although you always find it amusing when they forget to read the instructions and end up changing themselves instead. Your shop eventually gains a wider variety of items traded for or acquired from all over the world, many of them strange and unusual in their own ways. While you never quite manage to get as impressive a collection as the jackal-woman you first worked with, your shop soon becomes a close rival to her own, and you even begin to stock and carry items for the portion of the populace that can do 'special' tricks. Eventually trading with them for some simple tricks and enchantments on the shop itself, much like those on the shop you first encountered, and if your stock isn't as impressive yet, well you figure you have plenty of time to fix that, as you don't seem to be aging anymore either. You are definitely looking forward to a long and prosperous life of trading in unusual and strange things, and you especially look forward to those few fools who try to cheat or steal from your shop... they make such wonderful sexy pets after all...";

Jackalman ends here.
