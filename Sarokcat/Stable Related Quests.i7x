Leafing through the different requests, you find that the tone of them varies from pleading to demanding as this Fancy points out that the Stables is still somewhat a shambles. They note that while most of the employees are well trained enough not to comment, and they all love their jobs, she seems to feel that everyone would be much better off for a few repairs being made around the place. She also mentions that with the appropriate help, she could do most of the simple stuff herself and with the mares when they aren't busy with clients. You find the situation seems a bit curious, and looking at all the obviously ignored memos, you find yourself wondering if maybe you should talk to this Fancy about her situation and see what she might be willing to offer for a bit of help.";

Turning the corner into the sheltered lot, you find yourself blinking with surprise at the scene laid out in front of you, as the lot in front of you is covered in cars and other bits of junk and salvage piled up in some kind of semblance to a small fortress. Looking at the construction carefully, you can immediately see several items that you figure would be quite useful for the Stables to have, and more importantly what appears to be several small sturdy forklifts which were obviously used to maneuver things into shape, and are probably still working even now. Figuring that if anyplace has the construction materials and tools that the Stables needs, it would be this place, you begin to look for a way in so you can clear this place out of whatever has taken up residence so you can signal the horsemen to come loot the place.";

Activating the small radio transceiver again, you wait nervously for the horsemen to arrive again, and while the leader of the equines snorts at you with disdain on arrival, they seem gratified to find the store empty and full of useful items and loot. You feel somewhat encouraged as he eventually nods at you before leaving to coordinate the looting of the place, leaving a couple of horsemen with you on lookout as they begin to get things moving.

Whoever it was has also obviously been using some of the tools from the hardware store to help reinforce their not so little junk fortress, making the prospect of getting inside seem even more intimidating. Sighing as you look the situation over, you shake your head and decide to continue on your way, as even though the hardware store is probably well stocked with quite a few useful items, you can't really think of a need for that much hardware, and any smaller items you need can probably be found elsewhere for less of a fight than this obviously promises to be.";

This is the Horse Pit Fight Abuse rule:
	if ending "Horse Pit Fight Abuse" is triggered:
		say "You quickly settle into your new life as a Stables pet, your mind constantly clouded with desire, and your body aroused and needy all the time. The leather straps of your halter and harness rub over you softly with every step, and you have found it increasingly hard to even feed yourself with the bit in your mouth constantly and your lack of hands now that the boots they put on you have finished giving you proper hooves. Still you find it hard to mind much, considering your many masters are always eager to whip out their lovely large cocks and feed you your favorite liquid treat, and your needy excited pussy never goes unattended for very long as well. And if you don't really understand why sometimes the horsemen smirk at you oddly or make comments regarding you... well at least you know your masters are all happy with you, and that is all a slutty little bondage pet like you needs now isn't it!";
		the Player is enslaved;


to HorsePitFightAbuse:
	say "     You moan and try to struggle limply as they slip your new harness on, though the straps of leather feel increasingly comfortable as they slip into place on your changing body, the leather straps pushing your increasingly large female breasts out and making them incredibly sensitive. The tail ring holds your tail up, exposing your increasingly sexy, pert little ass and fresh and dripping mare sex, and the boots locking on your hands and feet make it impossible for you to even handle the simplest of things like doors and feeding yourself. Though perhaps the last and most intense embarrassment is when they slip your new halter over your head, the bit fitting nicely in your new equine muzzle and preventing any attempt at speech you might make.";
	say "     Fully outfitted like a slutty little mare, you can only moan helplessly as their hands rove over your new sleek and sexy body, and you find yourself finding it hard to concentrate on anything except the touch of all the powerful male stallions surrounding you. You completely give up trying to think about things when one of them slides their thick stallionhood into your damp, needy pussy, making you cry out with pleasure around the bit, much to their amusement. As the first of the many stallions surrounding you begins to use your newly bound body, you find yourself trying to recall what you were doing here, something about a quest? No, that's silly. What kind of quest would a slutty mare like you have? Unless it was to see just how many of these sexy stallions surrounding you you can get to blow their load in your cunt, that is...";

Feeling rather guilty you glance around you quickly, before examining the glass barrier protecting the items closely, trying to figure out just how to handle your first venture into grand larceny, although several of the pieces Nermine doesn't need should make you quite well off if you can ever get out of this place... You finally find some kind of latch towards the rear of the display you think you can manage to bash open with some effort, and you get to work.";

The noise is soon joined by a loud and annoyed roar from the direction of the foyer, and you wince as you realize that either one of the silent alarms was still working, or Valerie's hearing is much more sensitive than you thought. You barely have time to swipe the item Nermine sent you for off its display, before you have to turn to face the sounds of the rapidly approaching sphinx, abandoning any hope of swiping anything else as the museum guardian rounds the corner at a run.";

The sight of several rather stunning pieces of historical golden jewelry takes your breath away for a bit, as you admire the craftsmanship and the carvings in the sides of the pieces. Considering the circumstances, you are almost tempted to try to take some of the item with you, if it weren't for the rather strong looking glass surrounding the jewelry, that and the fact that you are pretty sure Valerie out in the foyer would probably object rather strongly and violently to any theft of museum property...";
