The person on the roof quickly ducks under the railing on the roof as soon as they realize that they've been spotted, making you even more interested in finding out what's going on. As you begin working your way over to the building with the person on the roof, you can see more movement above and small glances downward from the person on it, almost as if they are worried about what you are doing. Unfortunately for them, they should have been paying more attention to the skies above, as you can see one of those blue gryphons swoop down on the roof behind whoever is up there.";
			say "     You swiftly begin running across the street to the building, hoping to arrive in time to help whoever is on the roof. Drawing close to the building, you can hear the signs of a struggle from the roof. However, as you arrive at the building, you can hear the sounds go silent for a minute, before moans and other sounds of a more intimate nature begin coming from above. Hoping there might still be something left to talk to up above, you quickly search around the building for a way up, eventually finding a fire escape ladder within easy reach of the ground. After climbing up the fire escape, with the moans and squealing getting louder with every step, you prepare yourself for combat as you peek up onto the rooftop. Just as you do, there is a loud beating of wings as two gryphons take off from the roof, dancing and flirting with each other in the air as they fly to parts unknown.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Sighing, you continue to investigate the rooftop, stepping carefully to avoid the copious amounts of cum and milk spread all over from the gryphon's copulating. You find several scraps of what was obviously a military uniform scattered around the area, as well as a pair of dog tags lying in the middle of a pool of cum. The only other object of note up here appears to be the military issue binoculars, with several useful attachments and a nice case. This was obviously the item you saw glinting on the roof as their former owner scanned the area. Shrugging, you string the nice pair of binoculars around your own neck, as obviously the former owner won't be needing them anymore. Climbing down the fire escape and back into the city, you can already see the binoculars helping out your perception, though you still have more questions than answers about what the person was doing here.";

	else if mtp is 2:
		say "     Traveling through the streets again, you hear a distant sound in the air for a minute. Looking up and all around, you can only barely make out a jet trail high in the sky. Wondering why someone would be traveling that high, you are about to turn away and continue about your business when you notice a small speck drifting in the sky. You pull out your newly acquired binoculars and try to focus in on the speck to see what it is. Surprisingly, as you focus in the binoculars, the speck resolves itself into several people in urban camouflage falling through the sky! As you watch breathlessly, their parachutes open and they straighten up to land, though a sudden swirl of wind from over near the capitol building scatters their neat formation, blowing several of them to entirely different parts of the city. Shaking your head as the figures fall out of sight and into the city itself, you can't help but wonder what this means for the city and your hopes of rescue.";

Investigating further, you find that several military tents had been set up past the barricade in a mostly empty store parking lot. Investigating carefully in case there are still any trigger-happy soldiers around, you find that the makeshift camp seems completely empty, though there are several signs of a struggle in some areas.";
		say "     Gathering up your courage, you start looking in some of the tents, only to be surprised when you find that the large tents are full of empty, movable beds with restraints and scientific equipment. Looking closer, you can see that several of the beds were occupied sometime recently, and from the looks of things, the occupants managed to either free themselves from their restraints or [']convinced['] whoever was with them to free them instead.";
		say "     However they managed to get free, they definitely managed to turn the tables on their captors, judging by the remnants of sexual fluids evident in several locations and the strong sexual musk lingering inside the tents. Several discarded or torn bio-hazard suits and sets of lab robes are scattered about. You decide that, whatever the military was doing here, it would probably be best for you not to stay too long, and you hurriedly search through the rest of the tents, hoping to find a gun or something else of use left behind. Eventually giving up, you are forced to leave without a weapon, having found several boxes of ammo but no guns to go with them. You do find several small boxes of what the military jokingly calls food and end up taking some with you.";

You find a large, flatbed truck overturned on the road, with several jeeps abandoned next to it. Curiosity getting the better of you, you move closer to investigate the strange sight. Arriving at the overturned flatbed, you find that it appears to have been rigged to carry something relatively large, and from the way the straps and tie downs were burst open, alive. Moving around the truck to examine the jeeps, you discover that the jeeps and the area are covered in some kind of hardened goop, and sitting in the middle of the stuff are what appear to be several almost man-sized eggs.";
		say "     Wondering what happened here, you spy a bit of some military camo worked into the lining of one of the eggs. Closer investigation shows sign of a struggle, with several empty shell casings and even a thoroughly gummed up and useless military sidearm lying around. Recalling some of your earlier encounters and sightings with the wyverns in the city, you realize that it looks like they were trying to transport a couple of the beasts to some other location, probably for study like in that camp you saw earlier. Things obviously didn't go as planned again. As you look around at the numerous eggs that likely hold the transforming soldiers, you can't help but wonder what the military's interest in all of this is and why they aren't already in the city in force to help the survivors.";
		say "     You are startled out of your thoughts by one of the eggs shaking a bit as you stare at it and a small crack in the shell forming. Realizing that the eggs will probably start hatching soon, and that you are surrounded by quite a number of eggs indeed, you give a shudder as you hurry on your way, though you pause to take a sample of the goop surrounding the area.";

As if summoned by your thoughts of her, you see a familiar-looking hyena coming towards you from down a side street, a large grin on her muzzle. Before you can decide what to do about it, you are quickly enveloped once more in a large and enthusiastic hug.";

You said you would, after all,' she says as she releases you, causing you to stagger for a minute, before she grabs your hand and starts dragging you down the street, heading deeper into what the graffiti tags proclaim to be hyena territory. 'You must be pretty special to have survived out here this long on your own, but you don't have to worry about that anymore,' the hyena says as you are led through a bewildering maze of side streets and partially wrecked buildings to one of the warehouse districts. 'You have a whole gang on your side now, or pack, whatever you want to call it. You got our back, we got yours. Speaking of which,' she says as she stops in the middle of the street, facing a row of shipment warehouses. 'The name's Gina, and I guess I'm your sponsor for now, so let me know if anyone bothers ya or if you need anything,' the newly introduced Gina says with a grin.";
		say "     'Course, first we have to make sure you smell like you belong to me...' she says, giving you an evil look. Before you can protest, she has you pinned to the ground underneath her as she rubs her softly furred body against yours. The sensation and sudden pouncing cause you to gasp in surprise, and she takes advantage of your open mouth to once more give you a deep kiss, exploring your mouth with her surprisingly flexible tongue and filling you with her almost addictive personal flavor. Gina breaks the kiss, leaving your mouth open and panting as she continues to rub herself all over you, her hyenalike musk coating you in its arousing scent. You find it hard to think straight as she rubs her nipples across your face, letting you lick them and toy with them for a minute, before she backs off of you and hauls you unsteadily back up to your feet, still aroused and needy.";
		say "     'There now, that should help you fit in here better,' Gina says with a self-satisfied smirk as you can feel your body becoming more hyenalike already. 'And now everyone will know you belong to me,' she finishes with a grin, causing you to realize that her own musky scent seems to be clinging to you now, its bestial odor both strange and arousing at the same time. Noticing your increasing arousal, Gina runs her hand along your side slowly, causing you to twitch at the erotic sensation, while her other hand caresses her large package. 'Mmmh, and if you want to pick up where that left off, maybe we should go inside instead of just standing around out here in the street?' So saying, she walks up to one of the side doors to a nondescript warehouse nearby, swishing her hips and hyena tail at you as you follow her, your nose filled with her erotic scent and your mind focused on her lovely assets, leaving you unable to think about doing anything but following along like a good little hyena. As she opens the door and ushers you inside, she gives you a minute to take it all in, before going over to several mattresses set up nearby, obviously letting you decide what to do next.";

Looking closer at the bottle of sunblock, you notice it is called [']Happy Dolphin['] suntan lotion and shows the picture of a grinning dolphin woman on the front, her large tail resting on the sand behind her.

to say ResolveEvent Ruined Supplies:
	say "     Searching the area under the mall again, you find a small pallet of food supplies, obviously intended for use above at the food court. Unfortunately, you were not the first person to find these supplies, as someone has been here before you and made a pig out of themselves. Boxes are ripped open, food was obviously messily consumed, and almost all of the drinks have been opened, leaving the area strewn with wrappers and empty bottles. Eyeing the mess dubiously, you wonder if it is even worth searching through it all to see if there is anything left. Do you?";
	if Player consents:
		say "     Tossing the supplies and boxes to the side, you realize that tossing things around as you look through the remains of the supplies is actually kind of fun. You find small bits of food and a few mouthfuls of drink left over and continue searching for more. You quickly stuff them in your face, enjoying this strange type of edible scavenger hunt you have embarked on. Before you know it, you look up and realize that you have spread the mess around an even larger area than before and that you have been rooting around in the remains like some sort of pig yourself. As you stand up to leave, you hesitate to leave such an enjoyable bit of fun, and you are sure there are still some crumbs left behind. Thinking this, you begin to turn back to the mess of wrappers and boxes, only to catch a glimpse of yourself in one of the shiny wrappers and realize that you really have started to become rather pig-like yourself from your messy endeavors! Realizing that staying here any longer, however tempting it may be, would almost certainly result in your becoming totally porcine, you quickly hurry away, darting a few longing looks over your shoulder at the remains of the supplies before managing to get a hold of yourself.";
