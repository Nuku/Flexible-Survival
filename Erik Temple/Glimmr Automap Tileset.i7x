Version 1/100912 of Glimmr Automap Tileset (for Glulx only) by Erik Temple begins here.

"A tileset intended primarily for use with Glimmr Automap."


Section - Basic tileset object definition

The Glimmr Automap Tileset is a tileset. The translation-table is the Table of Automap Tiles. The tile-width is 25. The tile-height is 25.


Section - Zoom levels (for use with Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple)
[Tilesets used with Glimmr Automap need to provide a list of the zoom levels at which they can be viewed. The author of the tileset may choose any number of these, but they need to be listed in order from smallest to largest. They are expressed as decimal ratios of the full size of the tile, using the format for real numbers required by Michael Callaghan's Fixed Point Maths extension.]

The zoom-level set of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is usually {0.3600, 0.5600, 0.8000, 1.0000}.

The initial zoom level of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is usually 2.

Section - Translation Table
[Avoid assigning a tile to char 32 (empty space) -- this will slow down map display and cause flickering. If you want the map to have a background, either assign a background-image to the associated canvas of the map-renderer, or assign a background-color to the map-renderer itself.]

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Section: About

Glimmr Automap Tileset is a tileset extension intended for use with the Glimmr Automap extension. It requires a set of external images for use. This can be downloaded as part of the current Glimmr archive (https://code.google.com/archive/p/glimmr-i7x/downloads).

The extension can also be used as a tileset for any standard image-map element (see Glimmr Drawing Commands and Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing).

Section: Including tileset extensions

Tileset extensions are "data" extensions--they don't add any new functionality--and they must be included after the main Glimmr extension(s) in a project. If we are using the extension with Glimmr Automap:

	Include Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple.
	Include Glimmr Automap Tileset by Erik Temple.

If we are using the tileset with Canvas-Based Drawing:

	Include Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing by Erik Temple.
	Include Glimmr Graphic Hyperlinks by Erik Temple.
	Include Glimmr Automap Tileset by Erik Temple.
