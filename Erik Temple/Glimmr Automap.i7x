Version 2/101030 of Glimmr Automap (for Glulx only) by Erik Temple begins here.

"Provides a plug-and-play graphical automapping solution built on top of Mark Tilford's Automap extension. Can fall back to text-based map on interpreters that don't support graphics."


Chapter - Inclusions

Include version 3 of Automap by Mark Tilford.
Include Glimmr Drawing Commands by Erik Temple.
Include Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing by Erik Temple.
Include Glimmr Graphic Hyperlinks by Erik Temple.


Chapter - Use options

Use no query functionality translates as (- Constant NO_QUERY; -).
Use no post-processing translates as (- Constant N_POST_PROCESS; -).

Use MAX_ARRAYS of 3000.

Use automap hyperlinks. [This use option is provided by the Automap extension. It must be invoked to avoid compiler errors.]
Use automap static allocation. [Prevents crashes in Spatterlight and Zoom.]


Section - Maximum map size use option

Use automap reserved area of at least 3200.


Chapter - Console settings
[This is a "macro" that allows the extension to identify itself in the Glimmr console window with fewer keystrokes on my part.]

To say GLAM:
	say "[bracket]Glimmr Automap[close bracket]: ".


Chapter - ASCII map

[if the player's interpreter does not support graphics, the Automap text-based map (ASCII or Unicode) will be shown instead. This map is shown by expanding the number of lines in the status window. We can set the number of lines in the text map by using this variable. The default is 12 rows.]

The text-map depth is a number variable. The text-map depth is usually 12.

[To preview what the text-only map will look like to those using an interpreter without graphics support, paste the following into your story code:

First for constructing the status line:
	shut down the map-window;
	reserve automap memory of (text-map depth) rows;
	fill status bar with table of ordinary status and map;
	rule succeeds.]


Chapter - Configuration

When play begins:
	if glulx graphics is supported:
		now the current zoom is map zoomed in; [refers to Automap's zoom, which must always be set to zoomed in.]
		if the current zoom level of the map-renderer is 0:
			now the current zoom level of the map-renderer is the initial zoom level of the associated tileset of the map-renderer;
		if the map viewport is not a map-display window:
			now the map viewport is a random map-display window;
		if the display-layer of the UI-frame is 0:
			now the display-layer of the UI-frame is UI-layer minus 1;
		if the display-layer of the UI-query-explanation is 0:
			now the display-layer of the UI-query-explanation is UI-layer;
		repeat with item running through the list of UI-buttons:
			now the display-layer of item is UI-layer;
		if the horizontal margin of the UI-frame is 999:
			now the horizontal margin of the UI-frame is 5;
		if the vertical margin of the UI-frame is 999:
			now the vertical margin of the UI-frame is 5;
		if the vertical margin of the UI-query-explanation is 999:
			now the vertical margin of the UI-query-explanation is 38;
		if the horizontal margin of the UI-query-explanation is 999:
			now the horizontal margin of the UI-query-explanation is 0;
		if the number of entries of the list of display-active UI-buttons is 2:
			now the image-ID of the UI-frame is Figure of UI-frame-short.


Section - Default tileset (for use with Glimmr Automap Tileset by Erik Temple)

The associated tileset of the map-renderer is usually the Glimmr Automap Tileset.


Chapter - Hacking Automap

First for constructing the status line (this is the bypass status line map rule):
	if glulx graphics is supported:
		fill status bar with table of ordinary status;
		rule succeeds;
	else:
		reserve automap memory of (text-map depth) rows;
		continue the action.

[if you prefer that the MAP command toggle the ASCII version of the map rather than close the map window entirely, you can copy the following into your story file:

Chapter - Deciding (in place of Chapter - Hacking Automap in Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple)

First for constructing the status line (this is the bypass status line map rule):
	if glulx graphics is supported and the map-window is g-present:
		fill status bar with table of ordinary status;
		rule succeeds;
	else:
		now current zoom is map zoomed in;
		reserve automap memory of 12 rows;
		fill status bar with table of ordinary status and map.]


Chapter - The map-display window kind
[We need to change Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing's basic window-drawing behavior for the automap window. One of the most straightforward ways to do this is with a kind. A property would work as well, but we don't really want to be able to change this during play--map display would break entirely.]

A map-display window is a kind of graphlink g-window.

The map viewport is a g-window that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved] [if the author doesn't explicitly name the map viewport, we will automatically select a map-display window to be the viewport when play begins. In most cases, this will be the only existing map-display window.]

[The author may provide a maximum map size to use. This refers to the number of *tiles* to be displayed, not the maximum number of pixels, and can be used to restrict the size of the map for either performance or aesthetic reasons. For example, a fixed map size combined with a restricted number of available zoom levels can make it easier to predict the output size of the map.]
A map-display window has a number called the maximum map width. The maximum map width of a map-display window is usually 0.
A map-display window has a number called the maximum map height. The maximum map height of a map-display window is usually 0.


Chapter - Map window management

After constructing the status line (this is the graphic automap updating rule):
	follow the refresh windows rule;
	continue the action.


Chapter - Rules for opening and closing the map window

[We provide these as rules, so that players interested in a more complex system of windows can hook into them more easily. (For example, we might want two map windows on screen at once, one window at a different level of zoom than the other, or we might want to use Automap to display a map of the overall world, while using something like the Room and Dimension extension to render a map of the room itself in another window.)]

Section - Opening the map window

The opening up the map window rules are a rulebook.

Last opening up the map window:
	open up the map viewport.


Section - Closing the map window

The shutting down the map window rules are a rulebook.

Last shutting down the map window:
	shut down the map viewport.


Chapter - Extension of the tileset kind
[The tileset kind is defined in Glimmr Drawing Commands. We extend the kind here to allow for zooming.]

A tileset has a list of real numbers called the zoom-level set. The zoom-level set of a tileset is usually {1.0000}.

A tileset has a number called the initial zoom level. The initial zoom level of a tileset is usually 1.


Chapter - The map-renderer object

The map-renderer is a g-element. The map-renderer has a glulx color value called the background tint. The background tint of the map-renderer is usually g-placenullcol. The graphlink status of the map-renderer is usually g-active.

The scaling factor of the map-renderer is 1.0000. The x-scaling factor is 1.0000. The y-scaling factor is 1.0000.

The origin of the map-renderer is {0, 0}. The display-layer is 1.

The map-renderer has a tileset called the associated tileset.

The map-renderer has a number called the current zoom level. The current zoom level is usually 0.

[The map-width and map-height are set automatically by the extension. Authors will not need to set them directly unless replacing the resize canvas to map rule with one of their own devising.]
The map-renderer has a number called the map-width. The map-width is 0.
The map-renderer has a number called the map-height. The map-height is 0.


Chapter - New window scaling rule for the map window

For scaling a map-display window (called the viewport) (this is the select appropriate zoom level rule):
	[say "Applying zoom level...";
	say "Background color: [background tint of map-renderer].";]
	now the arbitrary scaling factor of the viewport is entry (current zoom level of the map-renderer) of the zoom-level set of the associated tileset of the map-renderer;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Window [i][viewport][/i] is a map-display window. Arbitrary scaling factor set to [arbitrary scaling factor of the viewport], based on entry [current zoom level of the map-renderer] of the zoom-level set of the tileset [i][associated tileset of the map-renderer][/i].[<]";
	#end if;
	continue the action.

For scaling a map-display window (called the viewport) (this is the resize canvas to map rule):
	let scaled tile-width be (tile-width of associated tileset of the map-renderer * arbitrary scaling factor of the viewport) to the nearest 1;
	let scaled tile-height be (tile-height of associated tileset of the map-renderer * arbitrary scaling factor of the viewport) to the nearest 1;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Scaled automap tile will measure [scaled tile-width] x [scaled tile-height] pixels, based on [i]map-window[/i] scaling factor.[<]";
	#end if;

	#end if;
	if maximum map width of the viewport > 0:
		if x-win > maximum map width of the viewport:
			now x-win is maximum map width of the viewport;
	if maximum map height of the viewport > 0:
		if y-win > maximum map height of the viewport:
			now y-win is maximum map height of the viewport;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	if maximum map height of viewport > 0 or maximum map width of viewport > 0:
		say "[>console][GLAM]Number of displayed automap tiles set at [x-win] tiles wide by [y-win] tiles high, taking into account author limits.[<]";
	#end if;
	reserve automap memory of y-win to the nearest whole number rows by x-win to the nearest whole number columns;
	if the map is drawn and the current zoom is not map absent:
		do nothing; [Automap's map is drawn by the phrase "if the map is drawn"; hence this odd instruction.]
	now the map-width of the map-renderer is (map width * tile-width of associated tileset of the map-renderer);
	now the map-height of the map-renderer is (map height * tile-height of associated tileset of the map-renderer);
	now the canvas-width of the associated canvas of the viewport is map-width of the map-renderer;
	now the canvas-height of the associated canvas of the viewport is map-height of the map-renderer;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Automap data calculated ([y-win * x-win] total tiles).[<]";
	#end if;
	continue the action;


Chapter - Element display rule for the map-renderer

An element display rule for the map-renderer when the location is unmappable (this is the unmappable room rule):
	exit.

An element display rule for the map-renderer (this is the map-renderer display rule):
	let tilesetting be the associated tileset of map-renderer;
	let scan be 0;
	let row be the win-y of the map-renderer;
	let column be the win-x of the map-renderer;
	let xx be the tile-width of the tilesetting * scaling factor of the current window to the nearest whole number;
	let yy be the tile-height of the tilesetting * scaling factor of the current window to the nearest whole number;
	unless the background tint of the map-renderer is g-placenullcol:
		dimrectdraw (color background tint of the map-renderer) in (the current window) at (column) by (row) with dimensions (map-width of map-renderer * scaling factor of the current window to the nearest whole number) by (map-height of map-renderer * scaling factor of the current window to the nearest whole number);

		#end if;
	unless the no post-processing option is active:
		follow the automap post-processing rules;
	repeat with count running from 1 to (map height * map width):
		increase scan by 1;
		if scan > map width:
			increase row by yy;
			now column is the win-x of the map-renderer;
			let scan be 1;
		let V be the map glyph of count;
		if there is a char of V in the translation-table of the tilesetting:
			choose row with a char of V in the translation-table of the tilesetting;
			let the current tile be tile entry;
			drscimage (current tile) in (current window) at (column) by (row) with dimensions (xx) by (yy);
			if the graphlink status of the map-renderer is g-active:

	#end if.


Chapter - Post-processing of map data

[The automap post-processing rules are provided as a hook to any post-processing we may want to do of the map data. By default, we repair corner tiles here by filling in the gaps of diagonals with small tiles. If post-processing is not desired, we can compile using the no post-processing option to avoid checking the rulebook at all.]

The automap post-processing rules are a rulebook.

An automap post-processing rule (this is the fill diagonal corners rule):
	let scan be 0;
	repeat with N running from 1 to (map height * map width):
		increase scan by 1;
		if scan > map width:
			let scan be 1;
		if the map glyph of N is 53 or the map glyph of N is 70:
			if (scan + 1) < map width, place glyph 73 at (N + 1);
		if the map glyph of N is 36:
			if (scan - 1) > 0, place glyph 71 at (N - 1);
			if (scan + 1) < map width, place glyph 73 at (N + 1);
		if the map glyph of N is 51 or the map glyph of N is 68:
			if (scan - 1) > 0, place glyph 71 at (N - 1);
		if the map glyph of N is 52 or the map glyph of N is 69:
			if (scan + 1) < map width, place glyph 74 at (N + 1);
		if the map glyph of N is 35:
			if (scan + 1) < map width, place glyph 74 at (N + 1);
			if (scan - 1) > 0, place glyph 72 at (N - 1);
		if the map glyph of N is 50 or the map glyph of N is 67:
			if (scan - 1) > 0, place glyph 72 at (N - 1);
		if the map glyph of N is 90:
			if (N - map width) > 0, place glyph 11 at (N - map width) imperiously;
			if (scan + 1) < map width, place glyph 12 at (N + 1) imperiously;
			if (N + map width) < (map height * map width), place glyph 13 at (N + map width) imperiously;
			if (scan - 1) > 0, place glyph 14 at (N - 1) imperiously;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Automap data post-processed to correctly render corner tiles.[<]";
	#end if.


Chapter - Reading and writing automap data

To decide what number is the map glyph of (N - a number):
	(- Automap_Chars->( {N} - 1 ) -)

To decide what number is the linked room-ID of (N - a number):
	(- Automap_Links-->( {N} - 1 ) -)

To place glyph (ch - number) at (x - a number):
	(- if ( Automap_Chars -> ( {x} - 1 ) == 32 ) {
	Automap_Chars -> ( {x} - 1 ) = {ch};
	}
	-)

To place glyph (ch - number) at (x - a number) imperiously:
	(- Automap_Chars -> ( {x} - 1 ) = {ch}; -)


Chapter - Graphlinking the map

A clicking graphlink rule when the current graphlink window is a map-display window (this is the automap forward graphlinking rule):
	repeat through the Table of Graphlink Glulx Replacement Commands in reverse order:
		if the current graphlink window is g-win entry:
			if the current graphlink x >= p-left entry and the current graphlink x <= p-right entry and the current graphlink y >= p-top entry and the current graphlink y <= p-bottom entry:
				now glulx replacement command is "";
				now the current graphlink is linkid entry;
				if there is an alt entry:
					#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
					say "[>console][GLAM]Mouse input received on graphlink '[current graphlink]' in window [italic type][current graphlink window][roman type]: ([current graphlink x], [current graphlink y]). Automap graphlink rules triggered for room [i][glulx equivalent of alt entry][/i].[<]";
					#end if;
					follow the automap graphlink rules for the glulx equivalent of alt entry; [the glulx equivalent is a type-casting routine. It returns a room.]
				else:
					#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
					say "[>console][GLAM]Mouse input received on graphlink '[current graphlink]' in window [italic type][current graphlink window][roman type]: ([current graphlink x], [current graphlink y]). Automap graphlink rules triggered.[<]";
					#end if;
					follow the automap graphlink rules for the current graphlink;
				rule succeeds;

A clicking graphlink rule when the current graphlink window is a map-display window (this is the automap background graphlinking rule):
	unless the no query functionality option is active:
		deactivate the current map label;
		now the image-ID of UI-query is the resting state of UI-query;
		deactivate UI-query-explanation;
		follow the refresh windows rule;
		#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
		say "[>console][GLAM]Mouse input received in window [i][current graphlink window][/i] (no link triggered): ([current graphlink x], [current graphlink y]). Query canceled.[<]";
		#end if;
		rule succeeds;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Mouse input received in window [i][current graphlink window][/i] (no link triggered): ([current graphlink x], [current graphlink y]).[<]";
	#end if;
	rule fails.


Chapter - The automap graphlink rulebook

The automap graphlink rules are an object-based rulebook.
The automap graphlink rules have outcomes exit (success - the default) and continue (no outcome).

The current map label is a g-element variable.

[The following phrase is defined in Mark Tilford's Automap, but in a section that only compiles when we're using Basic Hyperlinks. Basic Hyperlinks is not recommended for use with Flexible Windows, however, so we repeat the phrase here.]
To decide what room is the glulx equivalent of (n - a number):
	(- {n} -)



Section - Reorder report coordinates rule (not for release)

The report coordinates rule is listed first in the automap graphlink rules.


Section - Clicking a button

First automap graphlink rule for the UI-query (this is the query button management rule):
	if the image-ID of the UI-query is the depressed state of UI-query:
		now the image-ID of UI-query is the resting state;
		deactivate the UI-query-explanation;
	else:
		now the image-ID of UI-query is the depressed state;
		if the maximum display-count of UI-query-explanation > 0 and (display-count of UI-query-explanation < maximum display-count of UI-query-explanation) or maximum display-count of UI-query-explanation is 999:
			activate the UI-query-explanation;
			increase the display-count of UI-query-explanation by 1;
	follow the refresh windows rule.

Automap graphlink rule for a UI-button (called the pressee) when the image-ID of the pressee is not the inactive state of the pressee (this is the activate non-modal UI button rule):
	now the image-ID of the current graphlink is the depressed state of the current graphlink;
	display (image-ID of pressee) in the current window at (origin of pressee);
	[set a graphlink in the current window identified as pressee from (entry 1 of the origin of pressee) by (entry 2 of the origin of the pressee) to (entry 1 of the origin of pressee plus the image-width of the image-ID of pressee) by (entry 2 of the origin of pressee plus the image-height of the image-ID of pressee) as the linked action of the pressee;]
	revert the button after 0.1500 seconds;
	silently try the linked action of the current graphlink.


Section - Querying a room

Automap graphlink rule for a room (called the target) when the no query functionality option is not active (this is the display queried room name rule):
	if UI-query is display-active and the image-ID of UI-query is not the depressed state of UI-query:[if we're using the query button, we only want the action to proceed when the button is in its depressed state. Otherwise, we drop through to the author's rule.]
		continue;
	if the current map label is a rendered string:
		now the text-string of the current map label is the printed name of the target;
		now the origin of the current map label is the canvas equivalent of the screen coordinates (current graphlink x) by (current graphlink y) of (current graphlink window);
	activate the current map label;
	if the UI-query-explanation is not g-persistent:
		deactivate the UI-query-explanation;
	follow the refresh windows rule;
	deactivate the current map label.[The map label will disappear from the map, but only after the next time the window is redrawn.]


Chapter - Popup room labels (for use with Glimmr Bitmap Font by Erik Temple)

The current map label is usually the bitmap automap label.

The bitmap automap label is a bitmap-rendered string. The tint is usually g-black. The background tint is usually g-yellow. The display-layer is usually 2. The display status is usually g-inactive. The associated font is usually Glimmr C&C.


Chapter - New functionality for Automap verbs

Understand "zoom in" or "zoom out" or "zoom" as a mistake ("[only-one-graphical-zoom-level]") when glulx graphics is supported and the number of entries of the zoom-level set of the associated tileset of the map-renderer is 1 and not the command is mouse-generated.

Understand "map" or "close map" or "close map window" as zooming away when glulx graphics is supported and the map viewport is g-present.

Carry out zooming away when glulx graphics is supported and the map viewport is g-present:
	now current zoom is map absent;
	follow the shutting down the map window rules;
	rule succeeds.

Report zooming away when glulx graphics is supported and the map viewport is g-unpresent:
	say "[Map-window-closed]"

Understand "close map" or "close map window" as a mistake ("[map-window-already-closed]") when glulx graphics is supported and the map viewport is g-unpresent.

Section - UI element definition

[We do not want these images to be scaled by the canvas engine. The easiest way to ensure this is to assign them as direct descendants of the g-element kind, bypassing the sprite kind, which has its own scaling rules.]

A UI-element is a kind of g-element.
A UI-element has a figure-name called the image-ID.
The display-layer of a UI-element is usually 0.

A UI-button is a kind of UI-element. The graphlink status of a UI-button is g-active.

A UI-button has a figure-name called the resting state.
A UI-button has a figure-name called the depressed state.
A UI-button has a figure-name called the inactive state.


Section - UI buttons

Some UI-buttons are defined by the Table of Map Buttons.

[The UI-layer is a global variable holding the layer number on which the buttons should be placed. It should generally be at least 2 layers higher than the map layer. If no display-layer is explicitly set for the UI-frame, it will be placed one level beneath the UI-layer.]

The UI-layer is a number that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved] The UI-layer is usually 4.

UI-zoom-in	Figure of UI-zoom-in	Figure of UI-zoom-in	Figure of UI-zoomIn-depressed	Figure of UI-zoomIn-disabled
UI-zoom-out	Figure of UI-zoom-out	Figure of UI-zoom-out	Figure of UI-zoomOut-depressed	Figure of UI-zoomOut-disabled

A UI-button has a stored action called the linked action.

The linked action of UI-zoom-in is the action of zooming in.
The linked action of UI-zoom-out is the action of zooming out.


Section - UI modal buttons

A UI-modal-button is a kind of UI-button. Some UI-modal-buttons are defined by the Table of Map Modal Buttons. The display status of a UI-modal-button is usually g-inactive.

UI-query	Figure of UI-query	Figure of UI-query	Figure of UI-query-depressed


Section - UI anchor elements

An anchor-element is a kind of UI-element.

An anchor-element has a number called the horizontal margin. The horizontal margin is usually 999.
An anchor-element has a number called the vertical margin. The vertical margin is usually 999.

An anchor-element can be center-positioned, right-positioned, or left-positioned (this is its horizontal-positioning property).
An anchor-element can be bottom-positioned, central-positioned, or top-positioned (this is its vertical-positioning property).


Section - The UI frame

[The UI-frame is a framing element for the buttons that do the actual work. However, we use it as a hook on which to hang spacing and other information, and we also use it as a means to calculate the width and height of the UI elements taken together. It must be represented by a PNG file from which the width and height can be read.]

The UI-frame is an anchor-element.
The image-ID is usually Figure of UI-frame.


Section - The query explanatory text object

The UI-query-explanation is an anchor-element.
The image-ID is usually Figure of UI-query-explanation. The display status is usually g-inactive.

The UI-query-explanation has a number called the maximum display-count. The maximum display-count is usually 999.
The UI-query-explanation has a number called the display-count. The display-count is 0.

The UI-query-explanation can be g-persistent.


Section - UI-frame offsets

[The UI-frame offsets are pairs of numbers that give the left and top offsets from the frame or previous element for each of the UI buttons that will displayed within it.]

The UI-frame has a list of numbers called the UI-frame offsets. The UI-frame offsets are {
4, 4,[zoom in]
23, 4,[zoom out]
43, 6[query]
}


Section - UI logic

[The UI logic rules are used to decide which state should be shown for each button, and whether it should be clickable.]

The UI logic rules are an object-based rulebook.

UI logic rule for UI-zoom-in:
	if current zoom level of the map-renderer < the number of entries of the zoom-level set of the associated tileset of the map-renderer:
		activate graphlink for UI-zoom-in;
		now the image-ID of UI-zoom-in is the resting state of UI-zoom-in;
	else:
		deactivate graphlink for UI-zoom-in;
		now the image-ID of UI-zoom-in is the inactive state of UI-zoom-in.

UI logic rule for UI-zoom-out:
	if current zoom level of the map-renderer > 1:
		activate graphlink for UI-zoom-out;
		now the image-ID of UI-zoom-out is the resting state of UI-zoom-out;
	else:
		deactivate graphlink for UI-zoom-out;
		now the image-ID of UI-zoom-out is the inactive state of UI-zoom-out.

[UI logic rule for UI-query:
	if the current map label is display-active:
		now the image-ID of UI-query is the depressed state of UI-query;
	else:
		change the image-ID of UI-query to the resting state of UI-query.]


Section - Element scaling for UI elements

[The first rule bypasses the standard g-element scaling rule, which automatically scales the origin of an element to the window. Because we are calculating the origins of UI-elements based on the window itself, we have no need to scale. The second rule rule provides a handy place to do these calculations. The third rule arranges the buttons on the frame, based on the position of the frame as calculated by the second rule.]

An element scaling rule for an anchor-element (called the current-element) (this is the anchor placement rule):
	if the current-element is right-positioned:
		now entry 1 of the origin of the current-element is the width of the current window - (image-width of image-ID of current-element + horizontal margin of current-element);
		[say "Calculated: [entry 1 of the origin of the current-element].";]
	if the current-element is left-positioned:
		now entry 1 of the origin of the current-element is horizontal margin of current-element;
	if the current-element is center-positioned:
		now entry 1 of the origin of the current-element is the (width of the current window - image-width of image-ID of current-element) / 2;
		[say "[current-element]: Width of window: [width of current window]; image: [image-width of image-ID of current-element]; horizontal margin: [horizontal margin of current-element].";]
	if the current-element is top-positioned:
		now entry 2 of the origin of the current-element is vertical margin of current-element;
	if the current-element is bottom-positioned:
		now entry 2 of the origin of the current-element is the height of the current window - (image-height of image-ID of current-element + vertical margin of current-element);
		[say "[current-element]: Height of window: [height of current window]; image: [image-height of image-ID of current-element]; vertical margin: [vertical margin of current-element].";]
	if the current-element is central-positioned:
		now entry 2 of the origin of the current-element is the (height of the current window - image-height of image-ID of current-element) / 2;
	[say "[current-element] is placed at [origin of current-element].";]
	continue.

Last element scaling rule for the UI-frame (this is the UI-frame arranging rule):
	let instance be 0;
	repeat with current-element running through display-active UI-buttons:
		increase instance by 1;
		now entry 1 of the origin of current-element is (entry 1 of the origin of the UI-frame) + (entry instance of the UI-frame offsets of the UI-frame);
		increase instance by 1;
		now entry 2 of the origin of current-element is (entry 2 of the origin of the UI-frame) + (entry instance of the UI-frame offsets of the UI-frame);
	exit.

Last element scaling rule for a UI-element (this is the UI element scaling rule):
	do nothing;
	exit.


Section - Element drawing rules for UI elements

An element display rule for an anchor-element (called the current-element):
	display (image-ID of current-element) in the current window at (origin of current-element);
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Drawing anchor-element [i][current-element][/i] ([image-ID of current-element]) at origin ([entry 1 of the origin of current-element],[entry 2 of the origin of the current-element]).[<]";
	#end if;

An element display rule for a UI-button (called the pressee):
	follow the UI logic rules for the pressee;
	display (image-ID of pressee) in the current window at (origin of pressee);
	set a graphlink in the current window identified as pressee from (entry 1 of the origin of pressee) by (entry 2 of the origin of the pressee) to (entry 1 of the origin of pressee plus the image-width of the image-ID of pressee) by (entry 2 of the origin of pressee plus the image-height of the image-ID of pressee) as the linked action of the pressee;
	#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
	say "[>console][GLAM]Drawing UI-button [i][pressee][/i] ([image-ID of pressee]) at origin ([entry 1 of the origin of pressee],[entry 2 of the origin of the pressee]). Graphlink set from ([entry 1 of the origin of pressee],[entry 2 of the origin of the pressee]) to ([entry 1 of the origin of pressee plus the image-width of the image-ID of pressee],[entry 2 of the origin of pressee plus the image-height of the image-ID of pressee])[if the linked action of the pressee is a stored action]: [i][linked action of the pressee][/i][end if].[<]";
	#end if;


Section - Animations for button response

A glulx timed activity rule (this is the redraw button from timer rule):
	stop the timer;
	follow the window-drawing rules for the assigned window of the current graphlink.

To revert the/-- button/-- after (T - a real number) second/seconds:
	(- glk_request_timer_events({T}/10);  -)

To stop the/-- timer:
	(- glk_request_timer_events(0); -)


[Section - Optional undo control (for use with Undo Output Control by Erik Temple)

[This section can be uncommented should you wish to add buttons to your game that actually cause a turn to pass--none of the buttons as defined by default result in that.]

[The timer introduces a certain wild-card element. The upshot is that, when we undo, the events that happen after the timer fires are not "remembered"--so, the state of the button will still be active after we undo, and the timer event will not fire. The after undoing an action rule here requests the timer event immediately after undoing, so that the button will return to its initial state as needed. This has the added benefit of indicating to the player exactly what is being reconstructed after UNDO, the pressing of the button. This is rather primitive, in that the timer event is requested no matter the situation (i.e, regardless of whether the last turn involved a button press; however, things are structured so that this is harmless.]

After undoing an action:
	revert the button after 0.1500 seconds;]


Glimmr Automap ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: About Glimmr Automap

Glimmr Automap is, unlike most other Glimmr extensions, a solution rather than a framework. It provides a graphical map that draws a flowchart-style map to a graphics window, adding rooms dynamically to the map as the player discovers the story world. Glimmr Automap (GLAM) is a graphical frontend for Mark Tilford's Automap extension, displaying the map data generated by that extension using a graphical tileset, supplied as the Glimmr Automap Tileset extension. Users may also supply their own tilesets.

Glimmr Automap also provides easily configured user-interface elements for interacting with the map, including zooming in and out using onscreen buttons, clicking on rooms in the map to identify them onscreen, and more.

Glimmr Automap is primarily designed for use with Glulx interpreters that support graphics windows, but it will fall back to an ASCII (or Unicode) map on text-only interpreters, using the interface provided by Mark Tilford's Automap.

The extension requires most of the other Glimmr extensions in order to function, including Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing, Glimmr Drawing Commands, and Glimmr Graphic Hyperlinks. Also required are Glimmr's dependencies, including Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold and Fixed Point Maths by Michael Callaghan.


Section: A note on terminology

Through the course of this documentation, Glimmr Automap will be referred to either using its full name, or the abbreviation "GLAM". Mark Tilford's Automap extension--the engine that actually supplies the map data--will be referred to as "Automap" or "Mark Tilford's Automap".


Chapter: Including Glimmr Automap in a project

Inform remains fairly unsophisticated in its mechanisms for organizing included extensions. When we are dealing with a complex system of modular extensions such as Glimmr, it is very easy to trip it up, and the result is usually a list of unhelpful errors. For this reason, each Glimmr extension includes a section--such as this one--about how to include it, particularly in relation to other extensions.

Glimmr Automap should be included before any font or tileset extensions, e.g.:

	Include Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple.
	Include Glimmr Automap Tileset by Erik Temple.

You should not include Flexible Windows, Fixed Point Maths, Glimmr Drawing Commands, Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing, or Glimmr Graphic Hyperlinks in your project; these are included automatically, as is Mark Tilford's Automap. Fonts and tilesets *must* be included after the Glimmr Automap extension.



Chapter: Basic usage

Glimmr Automap renders the map data generated by Automap using a set of images defined by a "tileset." Tilesets are packaged as extensions, and Glimmr Automap Tileset is provided as part of Glimmr. Note that GLAM will not run properly without a tileset!

At its most basic, adding Glimmr Automap to your story involves just two steps:

	1. Include the extension and a tileset extension.
	2. Create a "map-display window" and an accompanying canvas.

The first step is simple. Unless we are using an alternate tileset, all we need to do is include these two sentences at the top of our story file:

	*: Include Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple.
	Include Glimmr Automap Tileset by Erik Temple.

We must copy the image files for the Glimmr Automap user interface into the Materials->Figures folder of our Inform project, as well as the images for our tileset. See Chapter 22 of Writing with Inform for more information on using images.

We may easily incorporate the "querying" functionality--which allows the player to click on a room in the map to reveal the room name in a tooltip--by including Glimmr Bitmap Font:

	*: Include Glimmr Bitmap Font by Erik Temple.

Glimmr Automap defines a new kind of graphics g-window, the "map-display window". The automap will only appear in a map-display window. You will need to create your own map-display window and define its basic characteristics (see the Flexible Windows extension for more on windows). This code will open a window with a black background above the main text window:

	*: The map-window is a map-display window spawned by the main-window. The position is g-placeabove.

We also need to associate a canvas with our window (see the docs for Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing for more on canvases):

	*: The map-canvas is a g-canvas. The associated canvas of the map-window is the map-canvas.

If we have no other graphics windows or graphic elements, this will be enough. If we do have our own g-elements, however, we will need to specify which ones belong on our automap canvas:

	*: The associated canvas of the map-renderer is the map-canvas. The associated canvas of a UI-element is the map-canvas.

This is all that is required to get a fully functioning graphical automap into our game, including a set of zoom buttons. The following sections will dive into options for customizing and configuring GLAM.


Chapter: The query functionality

As mentioned above, GLAM can print the name of a room to the graphics window in the style of a tooltip when the player clicks on said room in the map. This is known as the "query" function.


Section: Querying the room name

As mentioned above, the easiest way to enable the room-querying functionality is to include the Glimmr Bitmap Font extension. This will render the room name using the Glimmr Bitmap Font. We can, however, display the name in any font we like by changing the "current map label" variable. For example, if we wanted to use Glimmr Image Font to render the map label instead, we would do something like this:

	*: Include Glimmr Image Font by Erik Temple.

	The current map label is the image automap label.

	The image automap label is an image-rendered string. The background tint is g-Yellow. The display-layer is 2. The display status is usually g-inactive. The associated font is Glimmr Lucidex. The scaling factor is 0.4000.

(See Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing for more on the nature and properties of rendered strings, and of g-elements more generally.)

It is also possible to change the look of the tooltip even when we are using Glimmr Bitmap Font. To change the text and tooltip colors, for example, we might set the tint and background tint properties of the "bitmap automap label" g-element:

	The background tint of the bitmap automap label is g-Blue. The tint of the bitmap automap label is g-White.


Section: The query explanation

The existence of the query functionality will not be obvious to players unless we tell them about it. We can do this in our source text, but GLAM also includes a means for us to display this information to the player within the graphics window, via the g-element known as the "UI-query-explanation". This element is not displayed by default. To turn it on, we paste the following into our source text:

	*: The display status of the UI-query-explanation is g-active.

A text will appear above the UI frame that says "Click to identify a room". This text is completely hardcoded--to change the text or the color, we need to create a new PNG image for it. (The reason for this is speed--rendered strings may be slow on some machines/interpreters, and it is best to limit their use.)

By default, the UI-query-explanation element will be shown only until the player clicks on a room. If we prefer to show the explanation through the entire course of the game, we can add the following to our source text:

	*: The UI-query-explanation is g-persistent.

(Note that if we are using the query button--see below--then "g-persistent" will have no effect.)

We can move the query explanation text around the screen in the same way as we do the UI frame (see below).



Section: Disabling query functionality

It may be that we don't want to offer the ability to query the map. To disable the feature completely, employ a use option:

	*: Use no query functionality.



Chapter: Customizing the user interface

By default, Glimmr Automap places a small toolbar at the bottom of the window, containing + and - buttons for zooming in and out. This toolbar can be easily moved or removed. (We can also add your own buttons or remove the + and - buttons, but this is beyond the scope of this documentation; you should be able to figure out how to make the changes you need by studying the source code. You may need to familiarize yourself with the workings of Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing first, however.)

GLAM also provides a few commands for the player, such as zooming and opening/closing the map window. The game's responses to these commands can also be customized.


Section: Changing the zoom levels of the map

Any tileset that is intended for use with Glimmr Automap should provide a list of the zoom levels at which the author believes the tileset looks best. This is the tileset's "zoom-level set." Each zoom level is represented by a ratio (given as a fixed-point decimal fraction, always written to the fourth decimal place). Here is the zoom-level set for the Glimmr Automap Tileset:

	{0.3600, 0.5600, 0.8000, 1.0000}

If we don't like these zoom levels, however, we are free to change them. Glimmr Automap will deal intelligently with whatever we provide, but we must always have at least one level in the list. So, for example, if we want just two levels, we might cut the list down:

	The zoom-level set of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is {0.5600, 1.0000}.

Zoom levels should increase from left to right. In-game, pressing the + button really means "move one step to the right in the zoom-level set," while the - button means "move one step to the left".

We can specify which zoom level the game should start out at by setting the "initial zoom level" of the tileset. This is a number that represents the entry of the zoom-level set that we want to begin the game at. By default Glimmr Automap Tileset begins at zoom level 2 (0.5600, or 56% of full size). To change this, we can add something like this to our story file:

	The initial zoom level of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is 1.


Section: Anchor elements

Glimmr Automap handles window-canvas display differently from Canvas-Based Drawing. Rather than scale the canvas so that it fits the window, GLAM resizes the canvas. Each time the window is redrawn, GLAM calculates the number of tiles that will fit in the window--up to the maximum set by the "automap reserved area" use option (see above)--and changes the size of the canvas to match. The canvas is then centered in the window as per standard Canvas-Based Drawing behavior.

This means that there is no reliable way to set the positions of other elements (such as the zoom buttons). Canvas positions aren't reliable, since the canvas dimensions can change radically at different window sizes and zoom levels. So, Glimmr Automap introduces the "anchor-element." Anchor-elements g-elements that are placed (anchored) relative to the edges of the window, rather than to the canvas grid; these elements completely ignore the canvas, and instead are placed using textual "positionings" and numerical "margins".

GLAM includes two anchor-elements: the "UI-frame", which is a box that holds the zoom and query buttons, and the query explanation text ("UI-query-explanation," actually an external image file). If we want to add other graphic elements to the map window, it will generally be easiest to make them anchor-elements.

Anchor-elements are placed using adjectives for gross positioning, and a number for fine-tuning. By default, both the UI-frame and the UI-query-explanation have the same gross positioning: they appear in the bottom center of the window (see the section on the query functionality for more on the UI-query-explanation g-element). There are nine possible positions, three each for the "horizontal-positioning" and "vertical-positioning" properties. We can move an anchor element around the window by changing these positionings. The positionings are:

	horizontally: left-positioned / center-positioned / right-positioned
	vertically: top-positioned / central-positioned / bottom-positioned

So, if we wanted to move the UI-frame to the upper left of the map window, we'd type something like this:

	The UI-frame is top-positioned and left-positioned.

We can further tweak this positioning by setting the margins. The margin is the horizontal or vertical distance (in pixels) between the nearest edge of the window and the UI frame. So, if we want to move the UI frame farther from the top of the screen, we might add to our declaration of the UI-frame's position:

	The UI-frame is top-positioned and left-positioned.
	The vertical margin of the UI-frame is 50.

This will place the UI-frame so that 50 pixels separate it from the top of the map window, rather than the default 5.

Note that there will be no effect if we try to set the horizontal margin of a center-positioned anchor element, or the vertical margin of a central-positioned one: the element must be anchored to an edge of the window for the margin value to be meaningful.


Section: Removing the frame altogether

Removing the UI-frame (and its buttons) altogether is simple. Declare the UI-frame object to be display-inactive, and neither it nor the buttons it contains will be shown:

	*: The display status of the UI-frame is g-inactive.


Section: Changing action messages

GLAM includes a number of actions (most of them actually reimplementations of actions defined in Automap), all of which may print both success and failure messages. These messages can be changed by writing new "to say" phrases for them. For example, to change the message that is printed when the map window is opened, write this:

	To say map-window-open:
		say "You give some thought to the lay of the land, calling up a mental image of all you have seen so far."

Note that any such phrases you include in your story file must be placed *after* the line that includes Glimmr Automap.

Here is a list of all of the message names and their default texts:

	only-one-graphical-zoom-level
		"Zooming the map is not allowed.[run paragraph on][line break]"
	zoomed-in
		"Zoomed in to level [current zoom level of the map-renderer] of [number of entries of the zoom-level set of the associated tileset of the map-renderer]."
	zoomed-out
		"Zoomed out to level [current zoom level of the map-renderer] of [number of entries of the zoom-level set of the associated tileset of the map-renderer]."
	zoomed-in-or-out
		"Zoomed to level [current zoom level of the map-renderer] of [number of entries of the zoom-level set of the associated tileset of the map-renderer]."
	map-window-open
		"Map window open."
	map-window-already-open
		"The map window is already open."
	map-window-failed-to-open
		"[line break](Could not open the map window.)"
	map-window-closed
		"Map window closed."
	map-window-already-closed
		"The map window is already closed."



Chapter: Customizing the interface to work with new functionality

We may want to add new functionality to GLAM. For example, rather than showing the name of a room when the player clicks on it, we might want to move the player to that room.

If we do this, though, we may still want to retain the ability to query the map. GLAM provides a feature to allow this. We can add a ? (query) button in the toolbar: when this button is depressed, clicking on a room in the map will display the name of the room. Release the button, and clicking on a room will (say) move the player to it. We can also show the query explanation (see above) when the query button is pressed.

To add the query button to the toolbar, just activate the "UI-query" g-element:

	*: The display status of the UI-query is g-active.

Using the query button changes the behavior of the query explanation text (see above). When the query button is in use, the query explanation text-image will be shown every time the query button is pressed, disappearing after the player clicks on a room but reappearing when the query button is pressed again. This is intended to serve as a reminder to the player of the button's function. If we prefer to show the explanation only once, we can change the "maximum display-count" of the query explanation element:

	The maximum display-count of the UI-query-explanation is 1.

The default is the special value 999, which indicates that the text will always be displayed. If we were to use 3, however, the text would disappear for good after the player has queried the map for the third time. A value of 0 means that the explanation will never appear, so to disable the explanation entirely, we can do this:

	*: The maximum display-count of the UI-query-explanation is 0.

Note that the maximum display-count works only when the query button is in use; it will do nothing otherwise. Similarly, the "g-persistent" property used to control the UI-query-explanation in the absence of the query button has no effect when the button is active.


Section: A note on the functioning of mouse input

GLAM has special handling for mouse input to the map window. The general handling for mouse input to graphic windows is defined by Glimmr Graphic Hyperlinks: When a mouse click is received in a graphics window that is awaiting input, the "clicking graphlink rules" are consulted for that window; if a hot-linked zone of the window was clicked, we run the "graphlink processing rules" for the corresponding "graphlink". GLAM redirects mouse input to the map window (only) to the "automap graphlink rules". This segregates all input to both the map (clicking on rooms) and the provided UI elements (the zoom and query button) so that they can be handled by a separate rulebook. This is intended to make it easier to use GLAM alongside other graphics windows that might be displaying less specialized content. Be aware of this if you are adding your elements or behavior to the map-window. The best way to see how things operate is to study the source code.


Chapter: The map and the interface with the Automap extension

The map displayed by GLAM is actually generated by Mark Tilford's Automap extension. Automap provides data in the form of a gridded set of tile numbers. These tile numbers could be rendered in many ways; in fact, Automap provides translation tables to allow the same set of numbers to display a map with Infocom's Font3, with ASCII text, or with Unicode text. Glimmr Automap intercepts Automap's default behavior, which is to print the map to an expanded status line, and draws it using the "map-renderer" g-element. (The map-renderer is a specially made g-element that works similarly to an image-map.)

See the documentation for Automap by Mark Tilford for commands that can be used to change the way the map is generated--mapping rooms in particular places, for example, or changing how mapping is handled for rooms with closed doors.


Section: Memory allocation for the map

The Automap extension can dynamically change the maximum size of its map array, but this feature causes some interpreters to crash. Glimmr Automap does not allow dynamic allocation of memory to the map array. What this means for veteran Automap users is that the "use static allocation" option is always set, and the maximum size of the map must be set *at compile time* using the "use automap reserved area of at least X" use option. (Note that, due to a limitation in Inform, this number looks like a minimum, but is in fact a maximum.)

It is therefore important that we set the automap reserved area to a number that is high enough for our map to display as we want it to. GLAM calculates the dimensions by determining the number of tiles that would in the graphics window at the current zoom level. If GLAM calculates that the window would hold 45 horizontally and 24 tiles vertically, then the total number of tiles would be 45 x 24 = 1080. The default value set by Glimmr Automap is rather arbitrary (3200), but probably adequate to most purposes. We can in any case set the value higher if we like:

	*: Use automap reserved area of at least 3400.

If for some reason we need to make the automap reserved area less than 3200, we need to replace the section titled "Section - Maximum map size use option". If we want to make it less than 400, we need to edit the Automap extension directly. (We can make the *map*--as opposed to the memory reserved for it--smaller by setting maximum dimensions; see below.)

Use the "map dump" debugging command to see the dimensions and total number of tiles of your map at any given zoom level and window size.

Note that there is an odd circumstance that affects text-only interpreters, rooted in Automap's design: setting the "use automap reserved area" to higher numbers will move the text map toward the center of the window; the lower the number, the more toward the right side of the screen it will display. The 3200 default value ought to properly center the map on most screens, but try testing in the Quixe interpreter (which, as of fall 2010, does not support graphics windows) to preview the appearance of the text-only map.


Section: Map size

We can also specify the maximum dimensions of our map, in tiles. This can be used to restrict the size of the map for either performance or aesthetic reasons. For example, a fixed map size combined with a restricted number of available zoom levels can make it easier to predict the output size of the map. The maximal width and height values are attached to the map window object (as properties):

	The maximum map width of the map-window is 80.
	The maximum map height of the map-window is 40.

Of course, if the window isn't large enough to accommodate a map of these dimensions at the present zoom level, then the largest possible size will be used. Also note that if the "automap reserved area" limit is lower than the product of the map width and height, then the map will only grow as large as the reserved area. Be sure that your automap reserved area is at least as large as the product of the maximum map width and height.


Section: Post-processing of the Automap data

The tileset data that Automap produces is designed for text-based maps, or for maps whose room connector lines are only a single pixel wide. This causes a problem for tilesets such as the Glimmr Automap Tileset, which has connectors that are a few pixels wide. The issue is that diagonal tiles touch only at their corners, which leaves a triangular gap on either side of a diagonal connector. To fix this problem, Glimmr Automap reads the map data from Automap and adds tiles that fill the empty spaces around diagonal joins. This occurs in the "automap post-processing" rulebook.

We can add our own rules to this rulebook if there are other things we'd like to customize, or we can disable them entirely by including this use option:

	*: Use no post-processing.

We might want to disable post-processing if we are using a tileset that has connector lines that are only a single pixel wide. There is no need for post-processing of such a tileset, and we can avoid wasted time by simply bypassing the rulebook.


Section: Automap's zoom levels

Veteran Automap users know that that extension provides two zoom levels that actually report map data in different ways. These are "map zoomed in" and "map zoomed out". Glimmr Automap always uses the "map zoomed in" zoom level. For displaying large maps on screen, however, "map zoomed out" may be faster: whereas map zoomed in requires 9 tiles to draw each room, map zoomed out uses only 1 tile per room, a significant difference.

You can use "map zoomed out" in Glimmr Automap with the addition of only a single line:

	*: Last opening up the map window:
		now current zoom is map zoomed out.

However, Automap reuses tile numbers in ways that make the design of the Glimmr Automap Tileset look distinctly subpar when "map zoomed out" is the current zoom. The tile graphics could be modified relatively easily to work the map zoomed out view, if you want to go that route (or you can design your own tiles from scratch). See below for a few notes on creating tilesets.


Section: Toggling the ASCII version of the map

Glimmr Automap has the MAP command open and close the graphical map window. If you prefer that the MAP command toggle the ASCII/Unicode/Font3 version of the map rather than remove the map window entirely, you can paste the following into your story file:

	*: Chapter - Toggling text map view (in place of Chapter - Hacking Automap in Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple)

	First for constructing the status line (this is the bypass status line map rule):
		if glulx graphics is supported and the map-window is g-present:
			fill status bar with table of ordinary status;
			rule succeeds;
		else:
			now current zoom is map zoomed in;
			reserve automap memory of (text-map depth) rows;
			fill status bar with table of ordinary status and map.

This closes the map window and immediately expands the status line to as many rows as have been set in the "text-map depth" variable. Change the text-map depth as desired to resize the ASCII version of the map (the default is 12).

If you do this, you will probaby want to change the default messages for the "map" command as well, since it refers to opening and closing the map window. See below.


Chapter: Creating new tilesets

Instructions for creating image files for a tileset are outside the scope of this documentation. It is highly recommended, though, that you use PNG files with transparency for all tiles. You can use the image files included with the Glimmr Automap Tileset extension as a reference in creating your own tiles.

Section: Description of tilesets

A tileset is an object (of kind thing, to be precise) that defines the essential information needed for translating the list of numbers provided by the Automap extension into a grid of images. Declaring a tileset is simple:

	The Glimmr Automap Tileset is a tileset.

A tileset has only a few parameters. The most important is the "translation table". The translation table relates an arbitrary number to a figure name:

	The Glimmr Automap Tileset is a tileset. The translation-table is the Table of Automap Tiles.

	Table of Automap Tiles
	Char	Tile
	number	figure-name
	2	Figure of north south path
	1	Figure of east west path
	35	Figure of ne sw path
	36	Figure of nw se path
	37	Figure of empty room center
	90	Figure of diagonal cross
	91	Figure of orthogonal cross
	38	Figure of south wall
	39	Figure of north wall
	40	Figure of east wall
	41	Figure of west wall
	42	Figure of north exit
	43	Figure of south exit

Another pair of properties describes the dimensions of the tiles. These should (but strictly need not) reflect the actual dimensions of the image files in the tileset. The dimension properties are "tile-width" and "tile-height":

	The tile-width of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is 25.
	The tile-height of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is 25.

Automap tilesets are also required to have two additional parameters. The "zoom-level set" is a list of real numbers that describes the levels of zoom available; four entries in the list means that there are four zoom levels available. Zoom levels should increase from left to right in the listing. The "initial zoom level" tells us which zoom level to begin the game using, and is expressed as a number representing the appropriate entry of the zoom-level set.

	The zoom-level set of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is {0.3600, 0.5600, 0.8000, 1.0000}.
	The initial zoom level of the Glimmr Automap Tileset is 2.

If we don't explicitly include these parameters, then we will have one zoom-level (1.0000, or 100%), with the initial zoom level set to 1.

It is not recommended that you use zoom levels greater than 1.0000, as image quality will degrade. Instead, create your tiles as large as the largest size you want them to appear on screen, and use 1.0000 as your highest zoom level, with fractional values for lower zoom levels.


Chapter: Debugging

Glimmr Automap, like all other Glimmr extensions, includes a debugging log. This chapter includes basic information about the debugging tools, as well as those specific to GLAM; for more information, see the documentation for Glimmr Drawing Commands.

To use the debugging log, enable this use option:

	Use Glimmr debugging.

Now Glimmr functions will announce themselves, as well as the particular extension that generated them (e.g., Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing, Glimmr Drawing Commands, etc.) as they fire. Be warned that, under normal usage, Glimmr generates a lot of debugging information, and can quite thoroughly gum up a game's output. There are a few things we can do to mitigate this:

	1) The Glimmr Debugging Console extension can be included to segregate Glimmr logging output into its own window.

	2) We can set up our own alternate text-buffer window and direct log output there by setting the "console output window" variable, e.g.:

		The console output window is my-text-window [a text-buffer g-window].

	3) We can also send console log output to the transcript, while not printing it anywhere else. To do this, we include this code in our story file (it must be placed *after* the inclusion of GLAM):

		To say >console:
			say echo stream of main-window.

		To say <:
			say stream of main-window;
			say run paragraph on.

	This will only work when a transcript is actually being written. To ensure that we do not forget to initiate one, we can include something like this:

		When play begins:
			try switching the story transcript on.


Section: Glimmr Automap debugging commands

The map-renderer g-element is not an image-map (it reads a different data structure, a flat I6 array rather than an I7 list), but it is very similar in the way it renders a grid of images. For that reason, we provide debugging commands and capabilities analogous to those that Glimmr Canvas-Based Drawing provides for image-maps. To see which tiles have individual graphic hyperlinks, include this use option:

	*: Use image-map graphlink preview.

This will draw a thin gray box around each tile in the map that is graphlinked (that is, receptive to mouse input). We can change the color of the preview box by setting the "graphlink preview color" global variable to a glulx color value, e.g.

	The graphlink preview color is g-Lavender.

Note that if the graphlink preview color is set to null (that is, g-PlaceNullCol), no box will be visible.

We can "dump" the automap data to the screen by typing "DUMP MAP" in-game, and if we are running the game in the IDE, this will print the grid, using tile numbers, to the main window. The data dump also includes information about the size of the map, the tiles, the window, and the canvas.

In addition to dumping the map data, we can dump the contents of the automap links array, also provided by the Automap extension. The automap links array is the same size and shape as the map data array but it contains the room names of each tile that is linked to a room. (This is the array that powers the query function, and can also be used to go to rooms when the player clicks on them in the map.) The command to dump the links array is "DUMP AUTOMAP LINKS".

Chapter: Change Log

Version 2: Updated for 6F95. Now uses no deprecated features.

Version 1: Initial release.


Example: * Minimal Automap - This example shows the simplest possible setup for using Glimmr Automap. Basically, this means including the extension and a tileset extension, and then defining and opening up a map-window.

Add the line "Include Glimmr Bitmap Font by Erik Temple" after the Glimmr Automap inclusions to activate the query functionality.

Be sure to use the "opening up the map window rules" or to otherwise protect the phrase for opening your graphics window; if you don't, your game will not open in text-only interpreters.

To see how the map will look on text-only interpreters, add the line:

	Release along with the "Quixe" interpreter.

to the source code and press the "Browse" button in the results panel after compilation. Check out Mark Tilford's Automap extension for settings and commands that apply only in text interpreters.

	*: "Minimal Automap"

	Include Glimmr Automap by Erik Temple.
	Include Glimmr Automap Tileset by Erik Temple.

Example: ** Automapping the Manse - By default, Glimmr Automap responds to mouse input on a room in the map by displaying a "tooltip" that shows the printed name of the room clicked on. However, we may also want to do other things with mouse input to the map, such as moving to the room clicked, or displaying what the player knows about the room, or something different altogether. In this case, we can either deactivate the query functionality altogether, or activate the query button, which allows the player to move between query and custom modes. The latter is the approach taken in this example, which borrows the "going to a room" code from the Inform manual's "Misadventure" example (number 295). Clicking on a room will issue a command to go to that room.

We begin by setting up things more or less as in the previous example. Note, however, the first when play begins rule, which adds the query button (the UI-query g-element) to the toolbar. As explained above, when the query button is present, it must be activated in order for clicking on a room to act as a query. Otherwise, nothing will happen--or we can add our own behavior, as we will do here.

	Use automap hide paths through closed doors.

	The map-window is a map-display window spawned by the main-window. The position is g-placeabove. The measurement of the map-window is 50. The associated canvas of the map-window is the map-canvas.

	The display status of UI-query is g-active.

The primary map hyperlink mode is defined next, using the "go to any room" code from the Misadventure example in the Inform documentation. The only automap-specific code is the automap graphlink rule at the end of the block, which deals with mouse input to a room, issuing the command "GO TO <ROOM>" on behalf of the player.

	*: Understand "[any room]" as going by name. Understand "go to [any room]" as going by name.

	Going by name is an action applying to one thing.

	Check going by name:
		if the noun is the location, say "You're already in [the location]." instead;
		if the noun is not adjacent and the noun is unvisited, say "That noun did not make sense in this context." instead.

	Carry out going by name:
		let aim be the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;
		if aim is not a direction, say "You can't think how to get there from here." instead;
		say "(heading [aim])[command clarification break]";
		try going aim;
		if the location is not the noun, say "You'll have to stop here."

	Automap graphlink rule for a room (called the target):
		let target-text be the printed name of the target in upper case;
		change glulx replacement command to "GO TO [target-text]";
		exit.

And now we provide a geography to move around in:


	*: The Front Lawn is south of the Porch.

	The East Lawn is northeast of the Front Lawn. The West Lawn is northwest of the Front Lawn.

	The Rear Lawn is northwest of the East Lawn. Southwest of the Rear Lawn is the West Lawn.

	The front door is a closed door. It is inside from the porch and outside from the Foyer. "The front door is [if the front door is open]open[else]closed[end if]."

	The Dining Room is east of the Foyer. The Living Room is west of the Foyer. The Kitchen is north of the Dining Room. Bottom of the Stairs is north of the Living Room.

	The Hallway is east of Bottom of the Stairs, north of the Foyer, and west of the Kitchen.

	Top of the Stairs is up from Bottom of the Stairs. Master Bedroom is east of Top of the Stairs. Master Bath is east of the Master Bedroom. West Hall is south of Top of the Stairs. East Hall is east of West Hall and south of the Master Bedroom. East of East Hall is Front Bedroom.

	A tree is scenery in Rear Lawn. "Looks climbable." Instead of climbing the tree: try going up.

	Up from the Rear Lawn is Treetop. "A tall tree grows here. Large branches scrape against the house." Description of Treetop is "You could climb into the house through the window. Type IN."

	A window is an open door. It is not openable. "The window is open." The window is inside from the Treetop and outside from the Master Bedroom.

This final sentence may look like it is merely testing a condition, but in fact this is the Automap extension's means of mapping a room to a specific location. Effectively, the first half of the statement tells Inform to try to place the Master Bedroom 1 unit (1 room, basically) south of the Treetop. If the automapper is unable to do so, the error message will be printed.

	*: Before constructing the status line:
		unless Master Bedroom is placed 0 and 1 from Treetop, say "*** Error placing Treetop ***".



Example: *** Automap with Localized Compass Rose - This example shows how we can add new graphlinking functionality to the map. We may want to take advantage of the fact that the map indicates exits from the player's location to use them as a kind of compass rose, allowing us to click on the paths out of the room to go in the indicated direction (thanks to Jon Ingold for suggesting this idea.)

We do this by setting a special graphic hyperlink over the tiles that depict exits from the room occupied by the player. We use a table (the Table of Directional Correspondences) to match the appropriate direction to the tile number. We will set a graphic hyperlink using the name of the direction itself as the link identifier, and then convert this direction into a replacement command after the link has been clicked.

We begin by altering the map-renderer element itself, substituting a new rule for the extension's map-renderer display rule. This rule is essentially a copy of the map-renderer display rule. We change only the last few lines, where the graphlink is set. If the current tile number is found in the Table of Directional Correspondences, we set a directional hyperlink. If the current tile number is not in the table, then we either set no link or, if the tile number corresponds to part of a room, we set a hyperlink to the room.

The Table of Directional Correspondences includes only the tile numbers of directional connectors surrounding the player's current location; in other words, those referred to be the Automap extension as "full". It would probably be best to alter the image files for these tile numbers with arrows or some other graphic indication that clicking on the connector will move the player. I haven't bothered to do that here, but it would be simple enough to add using programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape, or GIMP.
