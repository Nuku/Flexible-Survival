After all, his feathers are so entrancingly beautiful... and you want nothing more than to stare into those slowly swaying spots.";

You obediently lie on the mattress while he looks over your [bodydesc of Player] body with unmistakable lust, his tapered cock already poking out of his slit. He slides over your [Skin of Player] body... it feels like a light, warm blanket. His hands explore your every curve, stroking and groping you teasingly.

'I need some relief, so get to it,' he says, rippling those dazzling tailfeathers. Unresisting, you lean in, taking the bird's cock into your mouth. Running your hands over his feathered hips, you work that avian shaft with your lips, tongue, and palate until your efforts are finally rewarded with a hot, sticky mess.

Enthralled by his enticing display, you don't protest when the presumably spent peafowl guides you up on unsteady footing, his scaly arms steadying your ascent. 'You thought that we were finished?' he inquires teasingly, making your knees tremble as you try to parse the meaning of his words in your sex- and hypnosis-induced haze. Chuckling softly, the resplendent bird guides you up against the coarse brick of the wall, using one of his taloned feet to spread your legs apart.";

You bury your face against the dirty red brick, your eyes fluttering closed. His talon-tipped hands glide over the curve of your rear, taking a moment to admire what's rightfully his. 'Such a fine piece of ass,' the fowl whispers into your ear, curling his thumbs to pry the dark cleft apart. The cool air of your exposure draws a shiver of delight, and you push your rear back with mounting excitement, steeling yourself for the mind-melting pleasure your experienced partner is sure to provide.";

By the time he pushes his wonderful rod inside of your rear, you can think of nothing but the immense pleasure of giving yourself over to this sexy, assertive bird and the bestial length spearing you open, pushing all the way to the hilt inside of your gripping asshole. Your entire body grows tense with arousal as you're enveloped in his lustrous feathers, metallic hues cradling your back and sides as he begins to pound into you.";

The heat of his body against you and the scent of your mutual arousal further mires your thoughts in the simple bliss of submission, your moans growing ragged as he rams himself within you. As his pace increases, [if Player is male]your length[smn] begin[smv] to bob and twitch, milking strained spurts of pre each time his pulsing spire grinds against your prostate[else]so does your sexless pleasure of being dominated by such a powerful male, the heat of friction leaving every nerve in your sensitive lining alight[end if].

Spurt after spurt of his hot, sticky seed paint your bowels in his essence, the tainted fluid splattering across your lining and filling you with a strange, intoxicating warmth. You feel yourself sagging weakly[if Player is male], even as you reach your own shuddering climax that wastes your lesser cum across the coarse brick before you[else] against the wall, savoring the feeling of his cum deep inside of you[end if]. Exhausted but awash in blissful tingles, you turn your neck to kiss your feathery stud, parting his beak to play with his tongue while you bask in his confident presence.[mimpregchance]";

You cherish the feeling of what does stay within, pursing your slightly gaping rim to seal in your lover's thick, musky tribute. But as you turn back to face him, the peacock's feathers begin to shift and sway, drawing your gaze back to those mesmerizing eyes. In a matter of moments, the sweet embrace of sleep envelops your conscious mind, and just like that, you lapse into a deep and satisfying slumber.";
