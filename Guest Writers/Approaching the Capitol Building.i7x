Version 2 of Approaching the Capitol Building by Guest Writers begins here.
[- Originally Authored By: Sweraptor -]
[Version 2.1 - Event duplicated by finding initial room.]

"This is an area which begins the player approach to the Capitol building. A skyscraper overrun with the Ebonflame Brood, and the supposed nesting grounds for the largest dragons and the Ebonflame God. Can you tell me how to make it so the monsters will appear randomly when the areas are explored?"

Government Assistance is a situation. The level of Government Assistance is 6.

Instead of Resolving the Government Assistance:
	say "     As you are traveling through the city, you recognize a couple of government buildings and offices, largely in ruin. The air is heavy with smoke and soot, but you start to run regardless. You recall that you're close to the State Capitol Building. If there's anywhere they'll know what's going on and where you can get assistance, it'll be there. You cough as you keep pushing through the smoky air, turning a corner to see what has become of the Capitol Building and the surrounding area, dashing your hopes instantly.";
	say "     The devastation here is extensive, with burnt out and smashed buildings all around. Several of the streets are cracked and broken, spewing flames. It looks almost like some twisted war zone. The creatures here must be particularly dangerous and devastating. From the look of the destruction, these creatures are probably roaming around the whole area, making traveling here quite risky. You'd best be extra cautious if you plan on looking around here.";
	now The Approaching the Capitol Building is known;
	move player to Approaching the Capitol Building;

Along the street are the skeletal hulls of cars and many other vehicles which have been burnt out. The structures of the area are all partially collapsed and broken buildings. They look like giants have fought amidst them. To the north, you can see the Capitol Building itself in the distance. It stands amidst the wreckage of surrounding skyscrapers, the lower half lit up by the surrounding flames. The whole structure is blackened and wreathed in smoke. Either some miracle or dark force has kept the broken building from falling.";

The Charred Streets is a Room. "     The damage to the roads and the buildings grow worse as you approach the Capitol Building. Most of the buildings here are semi-recognizable. You see what once may have been a designer underwear shop now burnt out with the windows smashed. You also spot one of your favorite video game retailers, what used to be a small family business. Now the storefront is totally wrecked. You jump over a ditch in the middle of the street. It is flooded with gray, soot-filled sludge. A water main nearby must have been cracked.".

To your west, you see standing buildings in somewhat good repair. Some structures are hung between them over the street. To the east, a few buildings partially stand before the ground seems to give way. Rubble blocks the way to Capitol Building itself.".

The A Volcanic Crater is a Room. "     Before you is an enormous, circular pit. It looks almost as if a meteor landed here, yet there is no trace of any debris. Lava and magma ooze into the pit's lower reaches. Close to the crater's lowest point, you see the entrance way to a tunnel system. The heat from the open magma is very intense and your nanites struggle to adapt your perspiration and breathing to better cope with the primordial scene.".

Rusty Walkways	"Rusty Walkways"

The Rusty Walkways is a Room. "     Rusty, makeshift bridges hang between the tall buildings here. Constructed from scavenged metal and parts, there are scattered little shelters inside the buildings or on the street. As you walk down the road, the bridges cast an ominous web-like shadow over you. Occasionally, you swear you see something or someone darting out of view each time you turn a corner. Whatever feral civilization exists here, it may be based out of the more intact building to the west of here.".
