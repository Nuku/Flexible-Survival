Before you are able to respond, the young nurse cuts in. 'My name is Tracy and I think you misunderstood me, though you moving in with me does sound like a fine idea, I was asking if you would like to go back to my town.

She explains that she ran the test twice to be sure. She tells you that you have nothing to worry about, no one knows, she made certain no one found out, and that she will be returning home since her tour helping the military is over. Asking what she plans on doing she explains that she will be going back to the hospital she works for and will be raising the child.";

You nod and explain that nothing would make you happier. The young lady introduces herself as Tracy, blushing you explain that you are terribly embarrassed that you never got her name before. Laughing Tracy tells you it is all right, she never intended any of this so you shouldn't feel bad.";
