		say "     The store seems bright and cheery with all of the lights on. You remember needing to come here on occasion to find an odd book or two. What it lacked in size in comparison to the big chain of bookstores, it made up for it in the wealth of older, hard to find, and out of print books and magazines in addition to newer releases. All the shelves in the store are crammed to capacity with books as well as the tables scattered around the store. Milling about are mall rats and other infected reading a book while either standing near a bookshelf or occupying a chair or little sofa in one of the seating groups.";
	else:

All the shelves in the store are crammed to capacity with books as well as the tables scattered around the store. Milling about are a mall rat or three reading a book while either standing near a bookshelf or occupying a chair or little sofa in one of the seating groups. Of what you can see from the glow of several candles and lanterns, all the books seem to still be in good condition.";

Beverly	"Beverly"

Beverly is a woman.
Description of Beverly is "     Behind a register counter is what looks like a mouse with green eyes intently reading a book, having not noticed you yet. The thick locks of blonde, curly hair on its head fall cutely around their large ears and flows down to frame their slender neck. From the glow of the candles you can make out that the fur of their face and muzzle appears to be a dark, golden-cream in color, and seems to shine even in the low light. Pierced in her right gray ear are a couple of medium-sized gold hooped earrings.".
Conversation of Beverly is { "Squeak!" }.

the scent of Beverly is "She smells like the books surrounding her mixed with a hint of hay.".

instead of conversing the Beverly:
	if bevkitty is 0 and bevtalk is 2 and house cat is tamed:
		say "     Beverly looks up from her book and smiles as you walk into the store. 'How are you doing out there?' Telling her you are doing fine, she sighs softly. 'I wish I was strong like you. Then I could go back to my place and find Dinah. I hate thinking about her being all alone...' Just as you are about to ask her who is she talking about, your pet cat appears out of nowhere, hops up onto the counter, and sits down with her tail curled around her legs. Blinking for a moment, Beverly tips her head and stares at the cat for a bit, her whiskers twitching in thought. 'Is that you Dinah?' she finally asks. When the cat turns to blink at Beverly, she claps her paws and happily laughs. 'It is you Dinah! Where did you find her?' You tell Beverly you found her wandering around outside then watch as she hesitantly reaches out to Dinah. She sniffs Beverly's paw a couple times before rubbing her head against it and purring loudly. Smiling wide, Beverly coos softly as she scratches the cats ears then laughs gently. 'I should have known my clever kitty would figure a way outside. You always did...' She scratches the bridge of Dinah's muzzle, her purring growing in volume, before beverly turns her attention back to you. 'I think it'd be best if she stayed with you.' Asking her if she is really fine with that, she nods and chuckles gently. 'She loves being outside, so it wouldn't be fair to keep her cooped up in here. Besides, I don't think I could if I wanted to.' Smiling as you pet Dinah's back, you promise Beverly that you will take good care of her house cat.";
		now bevkitty is 1;
	else if bevtalk is 0:
		say "     Behind a register counter is what looks like a mouse intently reading a book, her green eyes rapidly moving, not having noticed you yet. As you continue to stand there and watch them, their whiskers and gray ears eventually twitch and they look up, blushing with a squeak when seeing you. 'Oh, hello there.' The mouse's voice is quiet, demure, and sounds feminine. As they continue to blush, they look like they drop down behind the counter then walk around it to stand before you. 'I'm sorry. I didn't notice when you walked in. Sometimes I get a little lost in the books.' Now that they were from behind the counter, you see that the mouse standing before you is definitely female, a voluptuous one at that. She is dressed in a blue blouse that is stretched taut around breasts that are almost as large as her head while hugging her wide hips is a mid-length blue skirt. Her thick locks of golden hair flows around her ears, down her back, and stops just short of her full, bubble butt. You can see swaying slowly behind her a fur covered tail, with a thicker tuft of fur adorning the end of it.";
		say "     'Welcome to my home, Brookstone Books. Feel free to browse around, but because the way things are right now, I ask that you don't remove any books from here, considering some of them are irreplaceable.' Nodding, you begin to look around for any book that might be helpful. After a minute of browsing, you hear a soft sigh behind you. Turning around, Beverly is looking at you. When seeing you are looking at her, she pushes a forefinger against the bridge of her muzzle, as if adjusting a pair of invisible glasses, then gently smiles while brushing a lock of hair from in front of an eye. 'Would you mind terribly if I talked to you? It's been awhile since a new face has shown up around here and it will help to break up the monotony.'";
		if Player consents:
			say "     The mouse smiles wide and claps her dainty paws together. 'Really? Oh thank you.' You follow her as she heads back towards the counter then watch as she walks behind it to sit on a stool. After she is comfortable, she smiles brightly at you. 'So what's your name?' After you tell her she nods while continuing to smile. 'My name is Beverly Frisby. I was an elementary school teacher that was working part-time in the evening here at the bookstore, when I could, to make ends meet.' She places the palm of her right paw against the side of her head then chuckles gently and smiles embarrassedly. 'I forgot that I don't need my glasses anymore. Some habits are hard to break. Anyway, I was working on closing one night when there was a commotion coming from the mall. Peeking out the door, I saw what looked like a small group of, at my first thought, was people dressed in animal costumes attacking customers and committing unspeakable acts with them.'";
			say "     Beverly grows quiet for a moment, the inside of her ears growing red while her tail twitches a few times. Snapping out of her thoughts, she smiles and continues. 'Ummm... Where was I? Oh yes... When I saw what was going on I quickly dropped the security gate. As I was locking it, a humanoid mouse reached through the gate and managed to grab some of my hair. I was able to struggle free, but not before...' She stops again and seems to visibly shudder before continuing. 'Not before it managed to ejaculate on me.' Her breathing starts to grow more labored. 'When he, I figured out it was a guy, saw that he couldn't reach me, he left. I didn't wait around to see if he would come back and locked myself in the back room.' Beverly suddenly hugs her arms under her ample breasts while looking away and speaks a little softer.";
			say "     'I felt all alone locked back there as my body continued to transform, made even worse when the power went out. Only when it felt like I had finished changing did I try to feel my way around, eventually finding my purse and digging out the mini-flashlight I had.' She returns her attention to you and smiles gently. 'I was shocked, at first, when I looked in a mirror and saw what was looking back at me. I looked like the mouse that had attacked me. After I recovered from my initial surprise, I got up enough nerve to come out of the storage room, to find humanoid rats wandering the mall. When they didn't attack me and genuinely asked if I was OK, did I calm enough to take stock of my situation. While I was getting things together I noticed that my tail was fur covered, so I got curious to see what I actually was, and found out after perusing a few animal books that I'm actually a gerbil.' Beverly shakes her head slowly as she chuckles ruefully. 'Ever since my transformation I've been here, too afraid to go outside the mall after hearing about some of the things running around out there in the city. The rats have been nice enough to share some food and water they manage to scavenge since they know how hard it is out there right now.' She looks at you with a small smile. 'Thanks for listening to me. I feel better now. Do you want to tell me your story?' You shake your head with a smile and chuckle, telling her maybe later.";
			now bevtalk is 2;
		else:
			say "     The mouse's ears droop and she looks at you sadly for a moment before sighing softly. 'Th... that's OK... My name is Beverly,' she says, her voice so quiet it's barely a whisper. 'If you need any help, let me know.' Finishing, Beverly walks back behind the counter to continue reading her book. Out the corner of your eye, you see a mallrat giving you a dirty look.";

		if Player consents:
			say "     Feeling bad, you go over to the counter and gently clear your throat. When Beverly looks up, you apologize about earlier and ask if she wants to talk now. Her eyes brighten and she nods with a small smile. 'Yes... yes I would.' When she sees you're listening, she continues. 'I was an elementary school teacher that was working part-time in the evening here at the bookstore, when I could, to make ends meet.' She sighs softly, rests an elbow on the counter, and then rests her cheek in the palm of her dainty paw. 'I was closing one night when there was a commotion coming from the mall.

Stopping to read the cover, you grin and chuckle softly at the last names of the authors Dewey, Ketchum, and Howe. Thinking it's a humorous look at hunting, you decide to thumb through it, and find that it's actually a book discussing the finer points of being a hunter with humor sprinkled throughout. Leaning against a wall, you quickly peruse through the table of contents, skipping the chapters about gun and ammo selection, field dressing your catch, and anything else that wouldn't be of great help. The chapter discussing setting up a proper deer stand piquing your interest, you decide to start there. After some time though, you eventually lose interest and decide you will come back later to read the chapter on following your quarry's tracks.";
