[Master-of-Hell-Quest-Information by Luneth begins here.

[need to create a variable for "dark harem master" route vs "unlimited orgy" route
"Unlimited Orgy" will be the most used route, this will focus on everyone fucking everyone.
Dark Harem Master" will be different in the fact that the NPCs will be more into the player than each other, but they will still be open to threesomes ect...]
[Each NPC involved in the quest also needs a variable that will reflect ally vs lover since you wont have to fuck anyone you don't want to]
[Each NPC involved in the quest also needs a variable that will reflect obedience vs loyalty this will work with the new dark sanctum feature and secrets]
[Brutus's sex options may need a counter of some kind for the scenes in the past where the player pseudo raped him]
[Alter traits to include "Master's Bite" Skarnoth need to have this added and it needs to replace Brutus's "Soldier" trait. This will effect form and ascension]

Book 3 - Lords of Hell (first part of the quest)
[This event will trigger after the two Skarnoth & Brutus scenes. As of right now there is only one route which is threesome scene, but eventually there will be a new route opened up that will make it so that either one scene is needed(threesome) or two scenes needed(harem master).]
[This quest will officially start after sleeping in the players room, while sleeping the player will enter a dream where a voice will speak to them and tempt them to fill a void left after beating Skarnoth. This will also consist of explaining the ritual needed to truly take power, 5 lords of hell plus 1 hidden lord of hell that must be pure of heart and face the ultimate corruption(Elijah). This will also point the player towards Lilith and the burned out citadel]
[If the player agrees to this disembodied voice they can go to the burned out citadel which will go through a lot of lore and having to choose between Lilith and Atticus. Afterwards the player will be able to ascend both Skarnoth and Brutus separately, but they will have to ascend both before Nala will be able to be recruited as a lord of hell.]
[No matter if you choose Lilith or Atticus, the other one will still be an ally they just won't get some powerful new perk or become a member of the hellions pet.]
[Before the player goes after Nala they will be introduced to the dark sanctum by that same voice from earlier, this will introduce the new feat setup and explain how to gain thought-seeds from characters and what they do(gain secrets from characters).]
[This will allow you to travel inside your own mind, which will help with a lot of lore stuff but will also allow you to learn peoples dark secrets. Here is how that will work, having sex with say Lilith will reward the player with a "mental essence of Lilith", this will make it so after getting so many, you can spend them in the dark sanctum to get a scene that you were never there for letting you know a hidden secret. (warning: this is a lame example, but just for the sake of an example)Lilith watching Atticus pleasuring himself or fucking someone, and then pleasuring herself at the thought of him just taking her, being bred and knocked up by her own son.]
[Most of the secrets have alternate things that the player can do, leading to very different outcomes, an example will follow.]
[The example that I will use is this. Exposing Lilith would basically lead to an option where you could blackmail/force her into having a train of males just use her(conscious or not), which would raise her obedience but lower her loyalty. The other option would be to help her which could lead to a threesome or simply a twosome between her and Atticus, which would then lead to him knocking her up and new potential scenes of her being used as an offspring cumdump(the kind that will make her happy), this would raise her loyalty but lower her obedience. There will be tons of secrets to learn about each character, it will basically be about picking and choosing the routes you want and then dealing with the repercussions of their loyalty vs obedience.]
[This will force the player to deal with what matters more to you? A loyal ally or an obedient slut?]
[For Kev(the slaver/drug dealer incubus), the player will have to enter a world of depravity that is nothing like they have encountered before, this content will have varying forms of BDSM and training content. The player will have to prove to Kev that they are not weak and having him join them will not result in a bad deal for the demon. Can you show him the darkness needed to make a profit? Or will you embrace your humanity and help the addicts/slaves in secret.]




Book 4 - Seeds of Corruption (second part of the quest)
[The point of this part of the quest is to begin corrupting the land]
[Every person in the city has a weakness based on one of the 7 deadly sins, it will be up to the player to find them and also figure out a way to implant a seed of corruption]
[They will have to only choose 1 of each sin to awaken at first, however depending on if they can complete the entire quest, then you can also awaken the others that fall under the same sin as well]
[With each step of corruption the location of the corrupted soul will change to reflect their new demonic/yokai form]
[At the bottom of the file is a list of potential seeds of corruption so far.]
[The main goal of this part of the quest is Elijah, corrupting the land will lead to tendrils of darkness seeping into the entire city, which will make it easier to corrupt a being of pure light]
[There are also plans for an event at The Palomino where one of the ingredients needed to deal with Elijah is unicorn horn dust, so be ready for you and your hellions to be ready to party.]


Book 5 - The God of Chaos (final part of the quest)
[The final part of the quest is all about revelations. What have you been doing this whole time, have you been blindly following orders or is your rebellious heart screaming at you to break the rules]
[This part of the quest will have choices, but far less than what players are used too. The main goal here is to discover the truth behind who has been pulling the strings and why. This will also lead to a boss battle that will prolly be the strongest boss in-game as of yet, so it's not for the faint of heart. Are you the perfect puppet or will you be able to cut the strings of fate and rebel against a force that desires godhood.]
[The boss will have a lot of mouths/tentacles and be massive it will be a multi stage boss battle as well. Inspiration will be taken from pieces of legion/leviathan/abaddon/beelzebub]
[the first stage of the boss fight will be the player fighting and forcing them to use the hellions pet. After that though the fight will break into different stages forcing the player and the others to have to battle separately. It won't have you actually playing the other characters, but the scene will be different based on their own private pet level. The higher the level the better chance they can beat their part on their own, if they can't then its just more work for you.]

[orc lair seed of pride:
Breeder Day:
Basically everyone there needs the hellfire in their veins. warriors, breeders, it doesn't matter they all need to be fucked and receive your "blessing". The first event for that would prolly be breeding boghrim in front of everyone and then proceeding to bless the others as well. The event would of course continue with you needing to do it will all the future demonic orcs and of course orc hybrids that we have already seen. Also taking those hybrids and really working on a hierarchy for example: orc centaurs or the wargs being used as mounts and things like that.

Private Lair:
Creating a choice point where the "important" orcs (mul, brothers, urik, val, boghrim) can all be recruited, but the rest are made to go create another lair and essentially it's up to you to breed a better orc army. This would mean knocking up all the main orcs, not turning them into breeders necessarily, yes they will give birth, but warriors are still warriors. This would also give you the chance to decide on what hybrids you want. Players would also get romance/family arcs with some of your favorite green hunks, this would include jason as well.
You will still be in charge of the new lair but it will have a different role as more of a war camp than breeding factory.
