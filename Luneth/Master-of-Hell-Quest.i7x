Or did you want to reclaim your worthless servant?' The demonic prince seems confused at first, but eventually attempts to figure out what's going on. 'Oh yeah, you're like one of my old hellguard right? So one of you guys are serving the super sexy [master] as well? Well, that's good. I mean like, if you do all the fighting, then [SubjectPro of Player] will have that much more time to ravage me hehe.' The airheaded prince's drunk like words shock Brutus and he's visibly taken aback by the fact that his prince just referred to you as [master]. 'My prince! What do you mean by ['][master][']? Aren't you gonna take me back from the mortal? Or make [ObjectPro of Player] serve you!'";

I mean as long as I stay a good boy, I will always be used to sate [PosAdj of Player] desires, just as a proper little muscle slut should and I wouldn't have it any other way!' Brutus stands up with a look of disdain on his face. 'You worthless whore! Unworthy of my obedience!' Turning his back on his at one point prince, Brutus regards you with even more rage in his eyes than usual, 'You made the old master into your brainless slut?! The hellguard is broken too then. No going back for me now.' For the first time, you see the closest thing to hopelessness enter the demon brute's eyes, all while the demon's erection keeps growing in size.";

Well, that's good. It will make me feel better knowing that [SubjectPro of Player] has a strong warrior by their side.'

		say "     You confidently walk up to Brutus and begin to stroke his abs with one hand, slowly snaking your way higher, feeling the hard muscles of his pecs. Allowing one of your nails to scrape against his dark-purple nipples causes a sharp intake of breath from the broken demon and what had appeared as despair in his eyes now starts to fill with both lust and rage. Looking down, you can see his uncut dick begin to harden even further. The firmer it becomes, the less human it appears. Thick bumps begin to form around his shaft from underneath the sensitive flesh while at the same time his foreskin pulls back over the head of his prick, revealing firm ridges hardening just beneath the crown.";
		say "     Reaching up to the side of his face with your other hand, you softly stroke his horned jaw, before hooking a finger behind one of the protrusions, pulling him closer to you. Brutus's expression looks aroused and at the same time leery. Pressing your mouth against the demon's, you can't help but smirk when his lips pull back, baring his fangs. You slip your tongue out and gently caress one of his sharp canines, and a weird sort of purr then starts to come from the demon's chest as his eyes flutter shut.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You can't help but want to continue stroking the demon's fangs to elicit that sound, your smile beginning to grow bigger the longer Brutus's purr lasts. You eventually pull back, and the demon's eyes slowly open to see you grinning at him. Oddly enough, his face changes color, becoming a much darker indigo, and you can only assume it's because of his lustful desires. However, without warning, he quickly turns his head away from you as an annoyed look forms on his face, and he attempts to stand up straighter. It finally clicks: could it be that he isn't just merely aroused? Could he actually be... embarrassed that you caught him purring?";
		say "     Having come to terms with this new development, you move around Brutus's body until you are once again face to face. The demon opens his mouth, more than likely to attempt to threaten you, however before he can say a word, you surge forward and press your lips against his own. At first, his mouth remains immobile, but slowly, he begins to return the kiss. The demon's powerful arms surround your waist in a crushing grip, his claws digging into your midsection and piercing you. You know that you could use the power of the amulet to control the brute and force him to stop, however you have other plans in mind. Brutus eventually pulls back from the kiss and with an oddly curious look in his eyes, gazes down at the red marks that he left on your body.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The demon brute's face morphs into one ready for a threat. 'Why?' That one word speaks volumes to the mindset of the hellspawn, and you can't help but return the question with a simple, 'Why not?' Brutus's chest quickly begins to puff up in an attempt to appear more intimidating. 'Gonna trick me? Break me? Forget it! I'll never bow to a pathetic mortal!' With rising confidence, you remind the demon that you have already broken his old master, and you have also broken him to your will. Raising one finger in the air, you silence the outburst of rage you know that is about to pour from the brute's lips and finally say something to make him pause.";
		say "     You explain to him that you don't want another broken toy, but a soldier, an ally, now that is something you have much more interest in. Brutus turns his gaze to the rest of the room, as if preparing himself for some sort of trick or trap. 'Think I'm a fool?! It's just another way to break me into some obedient pet!' Not allowing yourself to react angrily to the outburst from the demon, you calmly explain to him that with Skarnoth under your rule, you are technically now the new ruler of the hellguard, and effectively his new lord. Before Brutus can make more accusations, you continue speaking and inform him that you have no desire to break him further, or to change him.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You simply desire to have a powerful, handsome, and brutal general, one that will be loyal and force any and all to bend to your will no matter what. A dark guttural chuckle fills the room, and the demon looks at you with a manic expression in his eyes. 'I'm strong, dumb and convenient. That's what the old master always said! Don't call me 'handsome' just to fuck with my head! Just use me as a tool to break slaves with, like he did!' With that, he pushes his long, thick, forked tongue to slip past his fangs and wiggles it around in an obscene way. Leaning forward, you allow your own tongue to lick upwards against the demon's, apparently shocking him if the loud growl is anything to go by. 'I am tired of your games, mortal!'";
		say "     Reaching up, you begin to fondle with his meaty chest, paying special attention to circling and teasing the flesh around the base of each of the horns adorning his collarbone. With your face so close to his own, you lean in and whisper that every ruler needs a dark knight, a being of depravity that will destroy and consume anything in their path. Pulling back, you ask him in your most seductive voice if he won't be the hand that delivers terror and corruption in your name. 'What do I get out of that?!' You simply smile and tell him that he will get everything he wants. The only thing that will be off limits are your other allies, well unless you give permission, but the rest of the city can be his dark paradise, as long as he serves you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Silence fills the air between the two of you for a moment and in a surprisingly small voice Brutus asks, 'Can you make the pain stop?' You assure him that if he stands by your side, you will do everything you can to keep him both happy and sated. Brutus thinks on this for a few moments. Eventually though, an arrogant smile forms on his lips. 'Let's say I want to destroy something with my cock right now. Am I free to leave and snatch up the prey I want?' You can't help but laugh out loud at his request, before pointing behind him, and in a seductive voice, you ask him why go out hunting when the prey has come to him. Turning around, Brutus is met with the sight of his broken master of the past, laying upon his throne like a perfect little [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]himbo slut[else]subby pet.[end if]";
		say "     'You'll share your whore?' Rubbing your body up against the brute's, you tell him to consider the submissive fuck-meat as a gift for his initiation as your general of the new hellguard, the only requirement to obtain this title being that he needs to kneel and accept you as his new [master]. A long pause takes place. 'If you are deceiving me, I will destroy you. Somehow.' The words are said so casually that you don't doubt he means what he is saying. With a firm nod of your head, the demon lowers himself down on one knee, and you stroke one of your hands up one of the giant horns on his head and whisper to him that you vow to keep his depraved hunger sated.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Brutus rises back to his feet, his still hard dick bouncing around with his movement. You let your handle circle around the dark-purple shaft, stroking it firmly and asking the brute if he is ready to claim his reward for becoming your soldier. With a sadistic smile on his face, the demon gives you a nod of approval, and the two of you make your way over towards Skarnoth's throne. The [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]airheaded [else]submissive [end if]former prince of hell doesn't even acknowledge Brutus and simply looks to you either for praise or orders. You explain to your slut that since Brutus has chosen to follow you faithfully that you have decided to offer him as a reward for the brute.";
		say "     The look on Skarnoth's face is [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]giddy, '[Master], you really want to watch me get used by a brute? That's kinda sick, I mean like [else]mortified, '[Master], you can't be serious! I have never fucked a brute, I mean [end if]come on they're animals, just corruption fodder!' You silence the past royal with a raise of your hand, explaining to him that it has already been decided and that he should be careful of what he says in front of his future [']lover[']. Glancing over at Brutus, you can see that his hard cock is already starting to drip precum on the floor heavily, and you take a step back. Your new soldier takes this as your approval to begin his fun and quickly grabs hold of Skarnoth's massive horns and yanks ";

		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Your royal slave has his tirade ended quickly by Brutus quickly shoving his entire 18-inches of prick inside of the slutty demon's throat, causing his eyes to tear up as he gags and chokes on the immense amount of meat that he is being forced to take in. Brutus looks down at the pitiful sight his past master makes with a vicious grin. 'Shouldn't talk with your mouth full, whore!' As if to exert his own sadistic pleasure, the demon brute then begins to chuckle as he grabs Skarnoth's horns like handlebars and begins to power fuck the royal demon's throat as intensely as if he were screwing the royal slave's ass at full speed. The [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]himbo [else]submissive [end if]demon's whole body flops around like a ragdoll as he does all that he can just to stay upright.";
		say "     '[Master], I'm gonna destroy this slut's throat-cunt!' Looking down, you [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]are shocked to see that Skarnoth is doing everything that he can to swallow ever bit of cock he can, even at the expense of oxygen, [else]can see that Skarnoth's face is starting to gain a slight blue hue to it from the lack of oxygen being inflicted upon him, [end if]and you decide that it would probably be best if you intervene. Walking up to Brutus's side, you pull his face towards your own, and he quickly captures your mouth in a searing kiss, the whole time never letting up on the skull-fucking that is being delivered to Skarnoth's throat. Feeling his long, serpentine tongue swirling around your mouth is almost enough to make you forget why you actually came over. Yanking your head back, you allow your fingertips to travel down the chest of the muscular brute, feeling the immense heat burning from within.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Breathless, you ask Brutus why he doesn't make use of the subby demon's other hole. 'Good idea, [master]. Its suck-hole is getting loose anyway.' The brute forces Skarnoth's face against his pelvic bone one last time, looking down with a devilish smirk and watching the bitch choke on the cock that is fully encased in the former prince's esophagus. 'You think that this was fun, hell-slut? The best part comes next!' With that, Brutus pushes the [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]dumb [else]subby [end if]demon off of his prick, causing him to fall backwards and gasp for breath. [if SkarnothDrugStatus is 2]The slut quickly attempts to crawl back towards Brutus's dick. Shocked by his former master's actions, the brute quickly [else]Without giving your slave a chance to fully recover, [end if]reaches down and grabs one of Skarnoth's legs, pulling it up and moving the former prince into the position he desires.";
		say "     Being forced to balance on one foot while the other is stretched over Brutus's shoulder, Skarnoth looks more like he is attempting to do the splits across the whole length of the brute's body. You can see him look down at the infernal prince's ";
		if "Nude" is listed in traits of Skarnoth:
			say "fully-exposed hole";
		else:

			say "     You walk in a slow circle around the two screwing demons, taking in the sight that the pair make. While Brutus appears to be having the time of his life ramming into the demon below him, Skarnoth seems to have retreated into a state of constant pleasure. The infernal prince's brimstone-colored eyes having rolled up into his head, and his long forked tongue is hanging out of his mouth. The bliss-addicted whore's cock shooting a fresh load of cum with each punishing thrust to his prostate. As you inspect the former royal's prick, you notice a definite movement in his abdomen. Taking a closer look, you can't help the chuckle that escapes your throat at the realization that what you're seeing is the bulge of Brutus's 18-inch cock. Finally, he's actually able to focus on you and attempts to plead with the brute to fuck him harder, 'Come on you beast, is that all you got! I though you brutes were supposed to be like good at this!' The comment enrages Brutus, causing him to pound the himbo with such speed and powerful thrusts that you can't help but wonder if the slutty demon can even handle it.";
			say "     Opening your mouth you remind Brutus that if he breaks the toy he wont be able to use it anymore. The brute simply rolls his crimson-colored eyes. 'I won't break your toy, [master]. We are demons and heal faster than even those little machines make you do. That's why demons are always virgin tight, no matter how much you use them! Ain't that right, you little cum-slut?!' With that, he reaches up and wraps a clawed hand around Skarnoth's throat and tightens his grip, making Skarnoth release a mixture of gasping breaths and choking squeals. Before you can comment on his current actions, the brute explains, 'It's all about control [master], I know how much this thing can take, besides if you choke it out a bit, then its cunt tightens up real nice, hehe. Realizing that Brutus is right, well going by the demons that you have encountered anyway, you walk back up to his side as he continues to punch fuck his cock into Skarnoth's hole, which does look awfully stretched at this point.";

			say "     Watching as the prince's backside jiggles with each thrust, you can't help the playful side that wants to be let out from within you, and you reach over, spanking the dumb demon's ass every time the brute pulls his dick back. This causes Brutus to chuckle, and eventually, it becomes a game between the two of you, each trying to make the other mess up the tempo. You notice what feels like a snake trailing up your leg and look down to see that the brute's dark-purple tail has started to coil around your calf. Glancing at his face, you see that he now refuses to make eye contact and what appears to be a burst of rage passes over his features as the color of his flesh darkens.";
			say "     You notice that Brutus is mumbling something in between grunts, and you strain your ears to make out, 'Take it! You know you want to! Give into your instinct!' At first, you aren't sure if he is talking to either you or Skarnoth, but then you see the brute's throat being purposely exposed ever so slightly, and without thinking, you give in. Rushing forward, you clamp your mouth over the firm skin you find there and lightly bite down, feeling a surge of heat erupt within your body. 'I'm not some fucking pussy! I can take everything you got!' Those words spur you on, and you deepen the pressure on his neck, and for a moment, you feel as if magma has surged under your skin, and Brutus lets out an ear-shattering roar.";

While Brutus appears to be having the time of his life ramming into the demon below him, Skarnoth seems to be either in a state of shock, ecstasy, or agony, you can't be sure which. The infernal prince's brimstone-colored eyes having rolled up into his head, and his long forked tongue is hanging out of his mouth. The demon's cock leaking a copious amount of precum with each punishing thrust to his prostate. As you inspect the former royal's prick, you notice a definite movement in his abdomen. Taking a closer look, you can't help the chuckle that escapes your throat at the realization that what you're seeing is the bulge of Brutus's 18-inch cock. Finally, he's actually able to focus on you and attempts to plead with you to stop Brutus, '[Master], you have to stop him! His cock is way too thick! At this speed, he's going to destroy me! I can feel my ass breaking!'";

We are demons and heal faster than even those little machines make you do. That's why demons are always virgin tight, no matter how much you use them! Ain't that right, you little cum-whore?!'

Pulling your mouth away from the demon's throat, you look down as he begins to shoot inside of Skarnoth, the torrent of cum just seems to be never ending. Your eyes go wide as you notice that with his plugged up, Skarnoth's belly begins to expand, giving him a slightly pregnant appearance. Eventually though, Brutus rips his cock free from the vice-like grip that Skarnoth's hole had on him and allowing all of the stockpiled cum to shoot out from his extremely gaping pucker, however right before your eyes it begins to heal and tighten back up. Once Brutus is finished he casually allows the infernal prince to crumple to the floor. Turning to face you, the demon brute once again pulls you into a heated kiss, but when he pulls back, you are shocked to see the look on Brutus's face. While he doesn't look peaceful, he certainly does look content. Could it have had something to do with the claiming bite you left on him?";

Otherwise I would have knocked your pussy up past the point of no return, haha!' His laugh while still giving off evil vibes, actually sounds... happy. '[Master], I'm going to try out my new freedom. Call my name though, and I will be there to punish any you desire!' With that Brutus leaves, no doubt to go about checking out the library and the surrounding area without a [']handler['] present. Reaching down, you gingerly pick up Skarnoth and carry him over to his throne and set him down gently, you take a moment to pet and love up your passed-out demon slut, praising him for his efforts.";

You can't help but also think about Brutus's parting words to Skarnoth, the whole knocking up thing. The idea of using Brutus as a breeding stud does excite you, and what better way to build an army than through conception[if carried of orc pill case > 0]. Then again, you do have something that you could use to make it possible for Skarnoth and even Brutus himself to get knocked up as well..[end if].";

This causes the former royal to close his eyes and simply enjoy the feeling of being owned, the knowledge that he's viewed as a good boy causing a sigh of contentment to release from his lips. A possessive smile forms on your mouth at the thought of how far Skarnoth has descended into the role that you've placed upon him. Walking back over towards Brutus, you take note of his massive erection and decide to explain to him that he needs to learn to control his baser instincts, 'Why? I'm a weapon and this is my blade!' With that the demon grabs ahold of his massive tool. As he says this Brutus barely acknowledges your presence, too busy glaring daggers at what was once his lord.

Snapping your fingers in front of Brutus's face in an attempt to pull him back from whatever twisted memory he's lost in, you comment on the fact that crushing things is good, but maybe not always with his cock. Informing him that perhaps he should put some of the energy from his libido into training his body, after all the better he can fight, the bigger the prey he can catch. This causes the brute to pause and slowly a vicious expression forms on his face, 'Hmmm, I like that idea.

[you could go to check in on Skarnoth and find him in some sort of lazy moment, basically playing around with the idea that without being in power he's lost his purpose. this would cause the idea of training up his confidence as well as making him more useful, the training would be tied into two parts. one being servitude with a sexual (cleaning while being revealing and a little obscene) and non-sexual route (simply keeping the place in order). the second being some combat training with a sexual (focusing on tempting and seducing an opponent) and non-sexual route (pure violence). the end of the event would prolly be in the shower room where the ending would be either him simply washing you down, or well yeah you get it, ending in the bite.]

With a smirk of your own, you begin to question the demon about what he's been doing with his temporary freedom. At first the former master of hell just stares back at you like a deer in the headlights, but eventually he breaks the silence, 'Well... I've been thinking on how my life has changed and what that means for me.'

You continue forward, finally reaching the bed and can't help the feeling of power that courses through your veins as you loom over the unsuspecting Skarnoth. Reaching out, you slowly caress the demon's face and can't believe how innocent he appears while asleep.

He's the new leader of your hellguard, meaning that he should feel pride with all of your decisions.

Looking down into the normally magma-like eyes, at the moment, they appear to be closer to a warm amber color, more than likely due to the demon's sleepy state. '[Master]?' The fallen prince's groggy and questioning tone tells you that he's still not fully awake yet. Leaning down, your nose softly bumps into the man below you, and with no other warning, you quickly capture his lips in a searing kiss that tastes like smoke and chocolate.

It feels like you're touching me everywhere, please don't stop!' A dark chuckle reverberates through you as you promise that you have no intention of stopping. Your eyes land on where the incubus's throat meets his shoulder, and without warning, a sudden almost instinctual need rises up within you. Remembering your last encounter with Skarnoth and Brutus, you had the same desire to lay claim to the demon brute. The only question is do you really want to give into this instinct? You attempt to think of reasons why this would be a bad idea, but the only thing that keeps popping into your mind is that he is already yours, so why not give him what he needs.";

Laying on a large bed that could easily fit ten or more people is Skarnoth being waited on and entertained by the promiscuity of his demonic guests. Looking closer at the prince of hell, you are brought back to when you first met him. The arrogance and self entitlement the being before you still has all of those traits.

Seductively, she saunters over to Skarnoth. 'Lord Skarnoth, due to the chaos on Earth, a portal has opened up, connecting both heaven and hell to the mortal plane.'

To be honest, you are a bit shocked that Skarnoth still managed to keep his eyes closed during the claiming bite. '[Master], what was that? It was so... primal. I feel different, [master]. I mean, I already felt that I belong to you, but after that bite, it feels as if every fiber of my being is yours to do with what you want.' With affection in your voice, you agree that he's right, he does belong to you, down to his very core, and a happy smile spreads across the prince's lips.";

Reaching over, you rub and knead Skarnoth's thick thigh with your left hand, causing a grunt to rise from the prince's throat as he attempts to thrust his cock further into the tight grip of the demon brute's mist. Slowly, you dip your right into the purple smoke that is the demon brute's current form and swirl your fingers around, caressing the glowing entity. 'Feeling a bit playful, are you, [master]? I thought that you wanted us to focus on your little royal slut here?' Brutus's voice in your mind sounds teasing, but you can also hear the desire in his rumblings.";

You're not sure if your actions are having an effect on Brutus or if he is simply giving you what you want, but slowly, some of the smoke starts to corporealize before your eyes. You quickly pull your hand back, not wanting it to potentially be trapped within the solidifying mist, and in the wake of your excitement, you are presented with a dark-purple dick floating in mid-air. Oddly enough, the base is still connected to the mist via glowing tendrils. Watching the hardening cock, you can see the foreskin begin to pull back, revealing the hard ridges just underneath the helmet and the protruding bumps forming along the shaft.";

Pearls of precum form at the head of Brutus's prick and begin to overflow, and without paying much attention, they dribble down onto Skarnoth's abs. '[Master], you're being awfully naughty. Ya'know that I don't need lube. My body is always ready for you!' With a hint of mirth in your voice, you explain that you must have forgotten and order him to get into a more [']subservient['] position while reminding him to keep his eyes closed.

With a chuckle, you inform him that [if carried of orc pill case > 0]if he's a good boy, you will in fact make him into your personal breeding slut, making sure that he is filled up with so many babies that he will never know what it feels like to not be knocked up[else]he's your personal slut, and it's good for him to always be the answer to your desires[end if].";

I will give you the most powerful offspring you could ever imagine[else]I want my body to be a riddle that only your touch can unravel[end if]!' No sooner do those words leave the incubus's mouth than the demon brute's ghostly hands reach up and spread the royal's ass, exposing his small pink opening. Feeling wicked, you shoot your hand out in an attempt to grab one of Brutus's glowing incorporeal hands, and oddly enough, you're able to grab it as if it were solid. Pulling it back, you're rewarded with a full bodied demon brute forming from within the mist.";

The voice in your mind sounds both amused and proud all at the same time, and you rush your mouth forward to claim his smiling lips, however, before you can fully enjoy the taste of your dark knight, a pleading voice can be heard from the decent-sized cot. '[Master], stop teasing me. Just ram [if player is male]your cock[else]that toy[end if] in, I need it!' Not sure exactly what Skarnoth is talking about, you peer around the demon's large body and are shocked by what you see. Hotdogging the incubus's ass is Brutus's hard cock.

You can hear the hurt in the incubus's voice and inform him that you are simply happy. This seems to do the trick and causes a smile to cross the prince's mouth. Crisis averted, you are about to lean forward and kiss Brutus, only to have the demon hold his hands up in front of you. With a wink of his crimson-slitted eye, the brute's hands fade into smoke and travel over to Skarnoth once again, spreading his ass open and making it easier for his cock to rub up against the royal hole in front of it. 'See, [master], no body needed.' A smirk forms on your lips at seeing this new playful side to the normally rage-engulfed hellspawn.";

Stepping forward, you begin to back the demon up against the side of the cot furthest away from Skarnoth and push his large form down. The impact startles the incubus, who up until now thought that it was only the two of you in the room and believed that you were behind him. His gaze snaps open and takes in the sight of the two of you chuckling. '[Master], what's going on?!' Before you can respond, Brutus chooses that exact moment to penetrate his former prince, causing Skarnoth to release a guttural moan as his eyes roll into the back of his head. With a level of casualness that impresses you, the demon brute gets into a proper position with his back up against the wall as he tucks his feet under the groaning demon prince.";
	say "     Skarnoth's body starts to lurch back and forth quickly as Brutus begins to pummel his hole. The whole thing looks slightly odd as while the incubus is being fucked in the ass, his face is right over where the brute's cock [']should['] have been. '[Master], you certainly made the right choice in turning this thing into a dutiful hell slut. Its hole is so tight that it feels like it might break, haha!' While the demon's words arouse you, one thing sticks out in your mind. Ever since he was introduced to Skarnoth, he has referred to him as an it, never as a person. Walking behind the incubus, that at this point can't even keep his head up, your hand darts out and grabs the base of Brutus's cock. '[Master], what are you doing?! Let me fuck this dumb whore!' Those words call back to when you decided to break Skarnoth of his entitlement, however, if you had wanted him to be a dumb broken slut, you would have just destroyed his mind, but... you didn't.";

	say "     You demand that Brutus say the incubus's name. 'Haha, is that all? Its name is hell slut. Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?' You explain that while that may be fine during sex time, he needs to also have a level of respect for the demon prince. 'Why should I? He treated all of us like fodder. He wasn't like you. He was a horrible master.' A swell of pride fills your chest at hearing that you are the superior choice, but you also explain to Brutus that the being in front of him is no longer his prince, and since they both belong to you, this in fact makes them brothers. The brute looks slightly uncomfortable by your words. 'Brothers? We are born from the lava pits of Hell. We don't... that word has no meaning to me.' Through the connection that you share with Brutus, you can feel something empty, and you comment on the fact that may have been his past, but not his present.";

You nod your head in agreement. 'Fine! Can I continue turning Skarnoth's ass into a cunt?!' His choice of words cause you to laugh out loud, and while it's not exactly what you had in mind, it's progress. You release your grip on the hellspawn's cock, and without any hesitation, he once again begins to pummel Skarnoth's insides. Walking back over to Brutus, you realize that there is no more room on the cot for your form and instead decide to straddle the brute's torso. The demon refuses to look directly into your eyes. You can only assume it's due to embarrassment from your talk, so you lean forward, gently pressing your lips to his own and allowing your tongue to rub and massage one of the demon's sharp canines, causing a rumbling purr to echo throughout the room.";

'Does this mean that I can still just do whatever I want to the rest of the city?' With a smirk, you explain to the brute that you have no intention of trying to turn him into a being of virtue and that Skarnoth is different than those other toys out in the city who are just waiting to be used and broken. A huge smile spreads across the demon's fanged mouth. 'So I can still grab anything I want out there and destroy its holes, well, other than those that belong to you?!' Smiling at how much he sounds like a kid at Christmas, you lean down and before you capture his lips, you whisper that he had better make sure that those whores' holes never recover from what he does to them.";

Not one to be outdone, you quicken your pace, pushing yourself closer to orgasm until it finally tears through your body.

	say "     Glancing over with the intention of pulling Skarnoth onto the free side of your body, you are shocked to see the tan adonis huddled in a corner of the cot by himself. Calmly, you ask him why he doesn't come closer and lay with the two of you. 'Why would I come over there? I'm just a cumdump to be used and thrown away, aren't I?' The look of betrayal and sadness in the incubus's lava-like eyes pulls at your heartstrings, and you ask why he feels like that's the case. 'Well, I came here to spend time with you, but instead of what I was hoping for, you had that animal use me!' You can feel one of Brutus's claws tighten at your side either in rage or guilt. You attempt to reach out mentally but can't seem to get a good read, almost as if too many things are overlapping with each other. Not wanting to make Skarnoth any more frustrated than he already is, you inform him that it's a pity that he doesn't want to join because you were looking forward to some cuddle time with him.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With a huff, the incubus finally comes over and lays his head opposite the demon brute. 'Fine, well, here I am.' Wrapping your free arm around the fallen prince, you are surprised when it's Brutus that breaks the silence. 'So... it's me that made you feel that way?' Silence fills the room for a few tense moments. 'I don't see anyone else calling me nothing but an [']it[']? Do you? I mean, we are demons. It's not like we can ever do anything but try to beat down anyone that doesn't own us!' The venom in the incubus's voice is palpable, but you can't help but wonder if this means that Skarnoth didn't actually hear your earlier conversation with the demon brute. You slowly begin to rub the agitated demon's back in an effort to help comfort him, but before you speak your dark knight prevents you. 'Well... that's our past, not our present.'";
	say "     You're glad that neither of them are looking at your face at the moment. You're a bit blown away by Brutus using your own words, but even more so that he remembered. The brute must be feeling more confident in the conversation because he continues without pause, 'We both belong to the [master], and [SubjectPro of Player] chose us because we are the best at what we do. If you look at it that way, it makes us brother-in-arms.' Skarnoth is getting a bit jittery to your left, leading you to hold him tighter as he speaks, 'We're demons. We don't have brothers, and ya'know it.' The empty way that the former royal says those words forces you to speak, and you tell him that this is a new world for them both and that means that the old rules don't matter anymore. Finally, Brutus sends a solid feeling through the link that you share before he speaks out loud, oddly one of humor, 'Well, out of the two of us, it's a given that I'm the big brother anyway!'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The incubus prickles at those words. 'You dumbass. The older brother is always decided by who is older and that's me!' The brute seems to mull that over for a bit, until he finally voices his own opinion, 'Yeah, well, I'm bigger, and everyone knows that the bigger brother has to look out for the smaller one! Besides, everyone also knows that the sluttier bottom bitch one is always the little brother. I mean, why have one if you can't breed him?!' You can feel Brutus's face breaking out into a smile against your side. 'Oh yeah? Well why would I ever agree to that? That just makes it sound like I'm still just something to be used!' Skarnoth snaps. At this point, you begin to feel the warning signs of a headache from all of their bickering. Hopefully, the brute to your right can pick it up through the connection you share. 'How about this? You agree to be the lil bro, and I will sometimes bring you back some goodies from city?'";
	say "     You can feel Skarnoth start to shake next to you, but thankfully it's with laughter. 'Oh yeah, that's just what I've always wanted, someone to bring sweets, haha!' Brutus is silent for a moment, but eventually speaks up with a hint of darkness in his voice, 'Who said anything about candy? I meant toys. Ya'know the [master] gave me permission to use anyone out in the city I want, well, as long as they don't belong to them, right, [master]?' Wanting this conversation over so that you can rest, you simply nod your head in the affirmative. Unfortunately, this leads to debates on the best way to capture people, what sort of sluts are the best to turn into fuck toys, and finally what's the best method of shattering a person's will. If you weren't so tired, you may have been more scared by the things that were mentioned, but you still manage a smile before sleep finally overtakes you. The sight of your two demon boys huddled at your side while their tails are intertwined in sheer glee at the chaos they would unleash let you know that things would never be boring at least.";

	say "     Walking into the maintenance storeroom that now serves as your bedroom, the bed calls to you as the door closes, the stress of the day catching up to you. Tossing your bag onto the ground, you nearly collapse onto the small cot that now serves as your bed. Laying there and looking up at the ceiling, you start to feel the need for sleep almost like a heavy pressure behind your eyes. Listening to the familiar sounds of the library, you can make out someone softly having a conversation from above and a hard thud from outside your door, more than likely Brutus taking his place guarding you while you slumber. As your eyes begin to burn with the need to rest, you close them in an attempt to help hydrate them, however once you open them again, your vision is blurry, and you have to blink a few times to get your eyes to adjust. You quickly realize that something is wrong and sit up while looking around, The room was never very colorful to begin with, but now everything appears to be in shades of white, black, and gray, almost like one of those old-fashioned movies.";
	say "     Standing up from the cot, a lightheadedness sweeps through your mind causing you to grab onto one of the nearby shelves, and you wait for your equilibrium to finally settle. Once you feel alright to move, you begin to make your way for the door, each step feeling like gravity is pressing your body harder into the ground with much more intensity than it should. Finally at the door, you wrench it open, fully expecting to be met with Brutus's massive form, but instead you only see swirling black smoke beginning to creep through the open doorway. While investigating the anomaly, you stop just before the tendrils of smoke can make contact with your body. Contemplating on what to do next, you turn your head slowly and look behind you at the small storeroom. You notice that while its appearance may have changed, it's still somewhere that you've marked as your own, and it still has that air of safety to it.";

Laying your head down on the small pillow, you close your eyes and do your best to focus on trying to wake up. Your own personal scent surrounds you but underneath that you can make out the smell of both Brutus and Skarnoth. Slowing your breathing and allowing your mind to go back to that moment the three of you shared, a strange static sound starts to build from within your mind until finally it becomes almost painful and jolts you completely upright in shock. Glancing around, you realize that the colors are back to normal, and in your attempt to get up, you almost fall off the cot. Rushing to the door and wrenching it open, you almost run right into Brutus's firm back and quickly wrap your arms around the demon brute as he turns around to face you. Finally pulling back, you happily inform him how grateful you are to see him. The only response you are met with is a single raised eyebrow, followed by a look of confusion.";
		say "     'Why can't I reach into your mind, [master]? Have you finally learned how to keep others out?' Confused yourself, you just stare at Brutus with your mouth hanging open, that is until you notice something different about his throat... Your bite mark is gone. The brute's face quickly clouds over with something akin to fear, the facial expression looking alien and out of place on your dark knight's visage. A ear-splitting roar bursts from Brutus's mouth, causing you to take a reflexive step back. Before you're able to ask him what's wrong, he interrupts you, 'What did you do?! My whole body feels like it's on fire again! You promised that the pain would end!' You don't know what to say, your jaw hanging open as you think of how to respond. 'You are liar!' Watching as the demon attempts to formulate his words, it's almost like the pain is too great for him to focus. 'You're not [master], you prey!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A clawed hand swipes down at your face, but before you're able to duck down, it stops just short of colliding. The look of rage and betrayal never wavers from the demon brute's intense gaze. 'I... will... destroy... you!' With one final roar, Brutus bursts into a cloud of purple smoke and is sucked back into the pendant that you had promised that he would never have to return to. Trying to make sense of what exactly just happened, you're once again pulled from your thoughts as Skarnoth rushes down the stairs of the bunker. '[Master], what was that sound?! It sounded like Brutus was shouting about something.' Opening your mouth to explain what just happened, it quickly snaps shut as your eyes lock onto the royal incubus's throat... His mark is gone as well. '[Master], what's wrong? You don't look so good.' A strange flash washes over Skarnoth's face, just like it did with Brutus, causing his eyes to roll into the back of his head briefly. 'I... don't feel very well, [master].'";
		say "     The demon slumps to the floor and ragged breaths start to escape his chest. Remembering what happened with Brutus and how whatever gift that was passed onto him must have reverted somehow, you quickly leap into action and reach out to help the formal royal to his feet. Doing your best, you attempt to get the demon up the stairs of the bunker and back to his chair as fast as possible. Once he's seated, his breathing finally begins to return to normal, although he still appears slightly out of it. Not knowing what else to do, you start to explain to Skarnoth what had happened with Brutus and then to himself. 'Wait, Brutus? You mean that drooling beast that you enslaved?' You gape slightly and then proceed to ask why he would say that about someone that he apparently was able to form a bond of brotherhood with. 'A bond of brotherhood? You must be joking, [master]. I've never even talked with that animal.' It's almost as if the submissive demon somehow forgot everything that took place after you began to place those bite marks the hellspawn in your possession.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     While processing what all of this could mean, a voice calls out from behind you, 'Is everything alright?' It's Elijah, his expression warm while meeting your gaze, but quickly turns cold as he takes in Skarnoth. 'You had best be staying out of trouble, demon, because if I find out otherwise, I will put you down before you can do any further damage.' The exhausted incubus merely mocks the angel and waves him off. Just as it looks as if Elijah's about to retaliate, you step in and explain to the angel that everything is fine and that you were simply checking in on him. With a shake of his head, the divine being's only response is, 'Don't pay these demons any mind. Remember that they are nothing but monsters, incapable of actually feeling anything other than the desire to destroy everything that they can.' With that, the angel gives you a slight smile and exits the room, leaving you to wonder if what Elijah said is true. A darker thought is quick to follow. If that's true then what does that make you, someone who gave them hope and a possible reason to feel, only to somehow rip it all away and erase those moments...";

However, the further you walk into the seemingly endless darkness, the tighter the grip of the tendrils become, feeling almost as if they are attempting to halt your progress. After what feel like hours of walking, you finally are able to make out a light further ahead and using all of your strength, you push on, finally freeing yourself from the shadow tentacles that have slithered around your form. As you finally burst free, your eyes are hit with the dim light of the room, causing a grunt of pain to escape your lips. Bringing your hand up to offer them shelter from the brightness, you try to allow them to adjust to the contrast in light. Once you're able to look around without your eyes stinging, you can see that you're standing on what appears to be a strange plateau surrounded by swirling smoke. Turning back, you notice that the doorway that you came through has somehow vanished into thin air.";

A slight tingle starts at the base of your skull and progressively makes its way down the rest of your spine. It's a familiar feeling, almost as if you're being watched. Whirling around in an attempt to catch whatever was spying on you, you're met with a haunting chuckle, well if you can even call it that, the sound being somewhere between the sound of a lunatic's ravings mixed with the sound of a wounded animal screeching. What you're met with is a semi-transparent shadow. At first, you aren't sure what to make of this discovery. While it's shocking to see a sentient shade, your time in the city has also taught you to pay attention to your surroundings. Looking closer at it, there is no way to figure out what exactly it's supposed to be a shadow of or if this thing even has a gender. A mouth forms on what you can only assume must be the shade's face, sharp, jagged teeth protruding outward from the freshly formed orifice.";

The creature smiles at you, something that may have been intended to put you at ease, however it causes quite the opposite, and you enter a defensive position instead. 'Haha, well that's certainly rude, don't you think? Here I am, trying to help you be more comfortable and what's my thanks? You act as if you're going to attack me, buhaha.' The being looks absolutely giddy by your actions, meaning it either wants a fight, or it views your antics as hardly a threat and silly.";

The being rises higher off the ground, dark tendrils emerging from the base of its form, each with their own private mouths that seemingly propel the creature's movement. Before you can react, the tentacled shadow begins to circle around you, maniacal laughter coming from every angle. While it's hard to focus on the beast itself, what with all of that shrieking piercing your ears, you finally thrust a fist outward and it appears to connect with... nothing. Your hand simply moved through the shades body, 'There, see? Wasn't that a fun little game to play? It's always fun to make new friends, don't you think?' Returning to its original spot, the shade continues to speak, 'As you can plainly see, I can't be touched. I am a being of the void.

The term [master] catches you off guard, your thoughts instantly turning to both Skarnoth and Brutus. The two of them have both been using that term a lot recently. You are pulled from your thoughts by a deep guttural rumble. 'This goes deeper than your little pets. They are merely tools to achieve an even greater ambition, well if you're strong enough to claim it that is.' Knowing full well that the names of your demons, or even their existence, never passed from your lips, you raise an eyebrow at the shade. The only reply that you're given is simply more cackling.";

'The truth is, while dreams are tasty, each filled with the hopes of mortals, nightmares are far more... delicious. All that fear, the adrenaline just under the surface, screaming to break free...' A vile-looking white mucus begins to drip from the shade's mouth. 'But I digress. Right now, we shouldn't be talking about my feeding habits, instead we should be discussing a potential symbiotic relationship that could be formed.' The disbelief has to be evident on your face. The way this creature jumps from topic to topic seems to have no real reason to it, almost as if it were purposefully attempting to be confusing. For the first time, the shade actually appears as if it's becoming frustrated. 'I suppose that since [']I['] already know the score, I never really expected that I would have to explain myself properly. How tedious. Well, even I can admit when I should be helping a lesser being to understand what should be obvious.'";

The liberator asked my [']name['], you fool... No, I already told you that you can watch, but no touching!' Taking a step backwards, you can't be sure whether this thing is simply crazed, or if there is something else here that you simply can't see. Your movement however pulls the creature's attention. 'Ah yes, a name. Well I don't particularly like the idea of names. They are simply a method of control. You see, knowledge is power, and I don't much care for the thought of anyone having that sort of power over me. However, perhaps a different type of transaction can be made, hmm?'

The way that the shadow talks makes it sound as if it already knows [']exactly['] what it plans on saying. 'This place is my own personal creation, somewhere that has a pull all of its own. You see, when mortals close their eyes, enter dreamland, and are full of intense emotions, their essence can find its way here.' Looking around at the vacant area, you aren't sure that you're able to hide how unimpressed you are by the place's appearance. 'Well what do you think of this space? I'm sure that it's a little bland by mortal standards, but maybe something could be done about that. If you could have a domain of your very own, what sort of residents would you enjoy watching?";

'What I mean is that if I were to simply give you this realm, purely as an example mind you, what sort of dreamers would you want to see visit?' The condescending tone of the shade's voice causes your hackles to raise. 'I mean in simple terms, would someone like you prefer a world filled with beautiful females? Perhaps a paradise of manliness and testosterone? Or maybe you're someone that can find the pleasure in a little bit of everything, hmm?'

A feeling of embarrassment washes over you at the idea that you actually played into this thing's game, but the shadow doesn't seem to be judging your choices, instead finding the whole situation more amusing than anything. Growing tired of the games that this creature is playing, you quickly shout at the shade to get to the point, demanding to know exactly why you're here! 'Tut-tut, that's a rather rude way to ask a question, don't you think? Besides, why should I tell you... when I can simply show you!' With lightning speed, the creature rushes at you, however rather than the impact that you're expecting, it fades into your body instead.";

Shaking your head and taking a few deep breaths, you stand up and brace yourself for whatever trick that shadow has planned. A light behind you catches your attention. Spinning around, you are met with a very familiar sight, although you have never seen it quite from [']this['] perspective. Looking forward, you can see a battlefield frozen in time. Both you and Skarnoth are in the heat of battle, grimaced mouths shouting out in silent rage. From inside your head, a voice vibrates through your skull 'I see that you remember this battle. The moment that you chose to get involved in things that were not your concern, and in doing so, decided the fate of this city... and perhaps much more.' Glancing at Skarnoth, it's almost like looking at someone totally different than the demon you've become used too. 'The demon prince was well on his way to claiming your realm. He had amassed his entire army in preparation.'";
		say "     The image hardens into ash, only to crumble and reform with the scene of you clasping the slave collar around the former royal demon's throat. 'The way leadership works in Hell is that when one master falls, the next in the bloodline absorbs the discarded energy and is able to take the throne. However, by sparing and enslaving him instead, you trapped his power.' Everything around you fades to black, until a scene unfolds: a huge hall filled with more demons than you can count. They all appear to be cheering and celebrating, however at the far back of the room is a large throne. A demon that looks surprising like Skarnoth is slumped over the side and judging by the wound to his throat, he's already dead. 'So now there are leaderless demons raging against the barrier to your realm and an empty throne that your pet's younger sibling could never properly fill.' Hearing that Skarnoth has a little brother shocks you since the last time you talked on the subject, he claimed that demons didn't have any brothers, but then again perhaps he didn't even know. Taking a deep breath at the thought of having to tell Skarnoth about his brother, you realize that you can't seem to suck in any oxygen.";

The demons will break the barrier and swarm the city. Left unchecked, they will spread like a plague across your world... and it's all your fault, haha.' Without thinking, you rush at the shadow, your fist already pulled back and ready to strike. A single clawed hand rises, causing your entire body to freeze in place. 'You really are going to learn how to keep that rage in check, besides there is one other option. You see, fate had already decreed that the current Master of Hell would have won, or that he would have been killed by a being of light. You know what that means, right?' Your mind starts trying to piece the information together. Basically, what this thing is saying is that someone should have died, either Skarnoth or Elijah.";
		say "     'This is why I hate mortals. They always think about [']people['] rather than the big picture... You! You were not part of fate's design and thus you changed it!' Turning to the side, the shade once again mutters something to someone that you can't see. 'I know, I know, it can't help that it's a lower life form.' The creature finally calms down again and turns back to address you. 'Let me try to explain. Let's say that fate is a riddle, alright? The riddle is something like, what walks on four legs in the morning, two during the day, and three at night? Any normal person would answer that it's obviously the victim of a killer that is adding and removing parts for fun, but you might answer something ridiculous, like the life stages of a human being. That's what you are: an anomaly that makes no sense!' Personally, you think the shadow's answer is the more idiotic one, but you don't say anything, instead waiting for it to continue.";

By breaking the former Master of Hell, you've somehow inherited a part of his power. I brought you here to guide you in how to help it grow.' Finally you open your mouth to speak, the question on your tongue being why you would want their help, or better yet why they would want to help you. 'Oh, that's simple, either your power grows, or the beings that you seem to care so much about, yourself included, will be destroyed. As to your other question... I'm just a helpful sort of demon, that's all, haha!' The comment is made so simply, as if the creature is commenting on nothing more than the weather. 'Oh come now. If anything, you should be thrilled that I'm saying there is a shred of hope, hehe! Then again, saying a shred is still overselling your abilities by a great deal.'

The ground erupts as a huge stone monolith rises up with something already written on its surface. Taking a closer look, you can make out the roman numeral for one and next to that is the list of genders you seem to be interested in. 'Ah yes, well I know that you mortals are suckers for a good theme, so why don't we choose one for this little dark sanctum of yours, haha. Be warned though, only one can be chosen, well for now at least. These things take up a lot of energy to maintain, and you will need to amass much more energy to gain more.

The shade turns its attention back towards the monolith, its long clawed fingers clicking together in a contemplative manner as it seems to be analyzing the huge stone tablet. 'Hmm, there are only two other topics that are in need of immediate attention. The first is a power base: you are going to need somewhere to build up your strength, somewhere with a natural connection to darkness.' Opening your mouth to speak, you comment on the fact that there is a burnt out church nearby that already has demons dwelling within. 'No, that simply won't do. Remember that this path will lead to you gaining many new enemies, and as such, you will need a much more defensive position. Lucky for you, I have already found the perfect location!' The creature's excitement puts your nerves on edge, but just the same, you ask the shadow to continue.";
	say "     'It just so happens that a huge demonic relic has arrived in the east part of the city, an ancient citadel that is the very incarnation of evil. It must have risen out of Hell from underneath the lava beds there. A word of warning though, it did not arrive alone... It would seem that a few demons must have been attempting to ride it as a means to breach your realm.' Rolling your eyes, you ask the shade if they are expecting you to fight your way through an army of demons to claim this relic? 'Well of course, but like all things in this world, it shall be easier said than done. The demons that [']were['] inhabiting the citadel well... they're all dead. Which is great news for you, however something much more dangerous has decided to claim the building for itself.' The shade comes closer and wraps its arm around you, and an extreme feeling of nausea floods throughout your stomach.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The creature quickly pulls its hand back and retreats a bit further away. 'Sorry about that, little [master]. I always forget that mortals don't do well with my touch. Anyways, as I was saying, there are many different types of hells, each with their own unique outlook on the world of mortals. The beast that has claimed our citadel is from one such place. His name is Shuten Dōji, an oni of considerable power. Thankfully for you though, his name says it all as he is quite the drunkard. You will have to approach this enemy with slightly different methods than you're probably used too. The truth is that this beast can't be outright killed... well it can, but he would simply pop right back up. Trust me, he's been killed before and that didn't stop him in the slightest. Also something to keep in mind is that he will be guarded by his troops of fellow oni and kijo, so don't underestimate this endeavor.'";
	say "     Rising high up into the air, the shade begins to explain the next aspect of what you will need for victory. 'Besides claiming the citadel, you will be needing to... acquire five very important allies to our cause. The first two are already in your possession, that brute and his former master will do nicely, however you will also need to find another [']natural['] demon. That should be your first goal since they will most likely prove useful in taking the relic. Afterwards though, we will need two demons that were born human, so keep an eye out on your travels. You will also have to force ascension onto the five at some point. Think of it as a form of... demonic evolution that will increase their power. To do this, you will need to share your strength with them, either by blood or sexual fluids, your choice. As each one awakens, they will become your lords of Hell, an essential piece of the puzzle.' Gliding down, the shade floats right in front of your face 'So, what do you think? Do we have a deal?' Somehow, everything about this question, makes it feel as if this is a moment that you will never be able to take back.";

'Yes, of course I remember, but I wanted to make sure that the mortal was willing to play the role intended for them.' Straightening back up, the shade looks directly at you, its normally wobbly eyes now completely still. 'I have been watching you for a while now, and I have seen the way you deal with situations. To be honest, it leaves much to be desired, so I have one final question for you. If you are able to claim the mantle of Master of Hell, what type of master do you think that you will become?'";

You miserable little insect! I offer you power, the ability to forge a new world and this is my thanks!? Consider yourself lucky that I don't simply trap you here and allow your physical body to rot and die!' With that, you are flung backwards into the darkness, the feeling of tentacles all around you, their harsh grip making it hard to breathe. A strange static sound starts to build from within your mind until it finally becomes almost painful and jolts you completely upright in shock. Glancing around, you realize that the colors are back to normal, and in your attempt to get up, you almost fall off the cot. Rushing to the door and wrenching it open, you almost run right into Brutus's firm back and quickly wrap your arms around the demon brute as he turns around to face you. Finally pulling back, you happily inform him how grateful you are to see him, but the only response you are met with is a single raised eyebrow followed by a look of confusion.";
		say "     'Why can't I reach into your mind, [master]? Have you finally learned how to keep others out?' Confused yourself, you just stare at Brutus with your mouth hanging open, that is until you notice something different about his throat... Your bite mark is gone. The brute's face quickly clouds over with something akin to fear, the facial expression looking alien and out of place on your dark knight's visage. A ear-splitting roar bursts from Brutus's mouth, causing you to take a reflexive step back. Before you're able to ask him what's wrong, he interrupts you, 'What did you do?! My whole body feels like it's on fire again! You promised that the pain would end!' You don't know what to say, your jaw hanging open as you think of how to respond. 'You are liar!' Watching as the demon attempts to formulate his words, it's almost like the pain is too great for him to focus. 'You're not [master], you prey!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A clawed hand swipes down at your face, but before you're able to duck down, it stops just short of colliding. The look of rage and betrayal never wavers from the demon brute's intense gaze. 'I... will... destroy... you!' With one final roar, Brutus bursts into a cloud of purple smoke and is sucked back into the pendant that you had promised that he would never have to return to. Trying to make sense of what exactly just happened, you're once again pulled from your thoughts as Skarnoth rushes down the stairs of the bunker. '[Master], what was that sound?! It sounded like Brutus was shouting about something.' Opening your mouth to explain what just happened, it quickly snaps shut as your eyes lock onto the royal incubus's throat... His mark is gone as well. '[Master], what's wrong? You don't look so good.' A strange flash washes over Skarnoth's face, just like it did with Brutus, causing his eyes to roll into the back of his head briefly. 'I... don't feel very well, [master].'";
		say "     The demon slumps to the floor and ragged breaths start to escape his chest. Remembering what happened with Brutus and how whatever gift that was passed onto him must have reverted somehow, you quickly leap into action and reach out to help the formal royal to his feet. Doing your best, you attempt to get the demon up the stairs of the bunker and back to his chair as fast as possible. Once he's seated, his breathing finally begins to return to normal, although he still appears slightly out of it. Not knowing what else to do, you start to explain to Skarnoth what had happened with Brutus and then to himself. 'Wait, Brutus? You mean that drooling beast that you enslaved?' You gape slightly and then proceed to ask why he would say that about someone that he apparently was able to form a bond of brotherhood with. 'A bond of brotherhood? You must be joking, [master]. I've never even talked with that animal.' It's almost as if the submissive demon somehow forgot everything that took place after you began to place those bite marks the hellspawn in your possession.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     While processing what all of this could mean, a voice calls out from behind you, 'Is everything alright?' It's Elijah, his expression warm while meeting your gaze, but quickly turns cold as he takes in Skarnoth. 'You had best be staying out of trouble, demon, because if I find out otherwise, I will put you down before you can do any further damage.' The exhausted incubus merely mocks the angel and waves him off. Just as it looks as if Elijah's about to retaliate, you step in and explain to the angel that everything is fine and that you were simply checking in on him. With a shake of his head, the divine being's only response is, 'Don't pay these demons any mind. Remember that they are nothing but monsters, incapable of actually feeling anything other than the desire to destroy everything that they can.' With that, the angel gives you a slight smile and exits the room, leaving you to wonder if what Elijah said is true. A darker thought is quick to follow. If that's true then what does that make you, someone who gave them hope and a possible reason to feel, only to somehow rip it all away and erase those moments...";

You attempt to struggle against the invisible force restraining you, but even then, the particles of darkness begin to seep into every orifice you have.

The shade seems to find your reaction amusing at the least, well if its cackling is to be trusted. 'Buhahaha, what did you think that evil was just something that happened? While yes, you did technically decide to follow the path of evil, all Masters of Hell must receive a small infusion of the original Heart of Darkness!

Like, I don't know, convincing a [']natural['] demon to join your cause? You did mention something about a burned up church if memory serves, but don't worry, we will have much more to discuss later, after you have adapted to the darkness within you a bit more.' With that, the shade gives you a final maniacal smile, and with its boney hand opening up and facing you, you're immediately slammed backwards.

Brutus emerges from within the pendant, the large demon giving his whole body a violent shake as soon as he is once again fully formed. With the demon brute's back to you, it's hard not to notice the way his huge purple ass shakes and jiggles. Glancing over at Skarnoth from the corner of your eye, you notice that his gaze is transfixed on what could be confused with an impromptu twerking moment. When Brutus finally turns around to face the two of you a strange look of confusion passes over his face at the expressions on your faces, 'What's wrong [master]?' Looking over at the former royal you can see the mirth in his lava eyes and the two of you burst into a fit of laughter that has you holding your sides.

However, this is not the smartest choice as you and Skarnoth are embracing the moment of immaturity. With your heads hanging over his back you are presented with the source of your amusement and eventually start a mini competition of reaching down and forcing each cheek to jiggle every time the demon takes a step. Brutus hardly seems to understand what is so funny about your antics, well at least going by his growls... and the fact that his tail will randomly whip around smacking each of your hands. Sadly this devolves into a new game, the name being: make the brute spank himself.";

Obviously noticing that your eyebrows raised at that information, he continues talking, 'The magic used on the pendant was made to lower my strength, at first the miasma was in the air constantly surrounding me, but after you marked me, it started to become a light powder that could easily be shaken off.' Well that's definitely something that you should have known about sooner, but there will be time to get into that later. Calmly you tell the demon that after stressing about having to deal with Elijah, your adrenaline was a little higher than usual and when he appeared in front of the two of you, he did a short impromptu twerking show.";

The look on his face his hard to read, but it definitely doesn't look please. You attempt to calm your dark knight down and explain that it was just a silly moment, however Brutus brushes your assurances aside and comments on the fact that your group really should be heading to the church instead of just standing around.

Since you like, own them and everything, is it alright if I use them?' A laugh erupts from your chest at how truly insatiable your offspring is, 'Tell ya what, how about I go deal with your mother, and I'll think on it?'

Brutus though, you can't remember ever seeing such a look of pride on his demonic visage, while most would probably assume that he was furious, you know better, this is the look of one truly ecstatic demon. Atticus begins to poke and prod the other two hellspawn, which the demon brute doesn't seem to mind, even going so far as to awkwardly pat the much smaller incubus on the head, which is rewarded with a beaming smile from your son. The demon brute's fanged mouth opens in a smile and his voice comes out as a soft growl, '[Master], your offspring is certainly a curious one isn't he?'";

A vein begins to pulse on the formal royal's forehead, '[Master], there is no way that this annoying little creature could share your bloodline!' This however causes Atticus's smile to disappear and become replaced with a vicious snarl, 'Oh yeah?! Well at least I don't have some huge set of horns that make me look like some big dumb cow slut!'

You can tell that the topic got under your sons skin, Atticus then walks back over to you and without thinking much on it you wrap him up in your arms.

And not a hair on his head had better be out of place when I come back out. Also keep your dicks to yourselves got it?' Brutus looks mortified that you would even feel the need to mention that last part, but Skarnoth simply inspects his claws and comments that he has higher standards. Before you can reprimand the former royal for his response, Atticus comes running back with a large box... filled with an ungodly amount porn.

Stars are for people that would be decent cumdumps and hearts are for ones with harem potential.' With that your son peels a heart sticker off and with a smile places it against Brutus's pec, 'See like that?' Brutus's expression is priceless, the normally dangerous and clawed hand gently feels the pathetic sticker on his skin, but treats it like it's something precious.

Skarnoth looks ready to spit bullets, but Brutus nods his head in a sage like way, either because he is humoring your son, or because now he is actually starting to wonder if Atticus is right about Skarnoth being some sort of demonic cow.

Eventually you're able to catch a glimpse of candlelight just ahead of you and make your way towards it, finally entering the inner sanctum of the building, you are surprised by the sight that awaits you. You see Lilith standing off to the side, her stance and posture reminding you more of a regal queen, rather than just a simple succubus. Then again, just with what little you have learned about her through the memories that you've experienced, it's doubtful that there could be anything really [']simple['] about her. That's not the surprising part though, that would be what is laying on the ground a few feet away from her. Looking down at the... [']object['], it's basically just a huge cock laying on the ground, the only movement from it is an occasional throb. At first it appears to be one of those creepy cock cannon creatures, but as you peer closer, you realize that this thing still has a body underneath it's massive prick.";
	say "     The look on Lilith's face is one of annoyance and she leisurely strides over to the person on the floor, her heels clicking with each step towards... well as much of a person as is left that is, 'What's wrong stud? I thought you were going to come in here and claim some slut as your concubine, at least that's what you told my son...' The man starts to struggle from underneath his oversized appendage, while slightly muffled you are still able to make out the words of his screaming voice, 'You fucking psycho bitch! Change my dick back to normal, right goddamn now!' The succubus giggles slightly into the back of her hand, most likely at the simple fact that a mortal would make demands of her. She gracefully raises one leg up and plants her heel on top of one of his massive testicles, 'But I thought you wanted to be larger? Your mind revealed your true desire and I quote, [']I wish I had a bitch-breaker dick, then I could I could show everyone what a real man I am and how I deserve all of their sluts for my harem['].

While the building is still pretty dark, you can make out the face of a darker skinned demon, the only parts of him that really stand out are his horns, and the multiple piercings across his face that glisten in the candlelight. Before you can respond though, Lilith's lyrical voice can be heard, 'Come in Kev, you [']do['] realize that your late don't you?' Well if she knows that he's here then she must have also realized that you had arrived as well. The two of you step further into the room, finally within the circle of candles everything does seem a bit brighter, oddly enough the demon attempts to discreetly sniff you as he walks by.";

'Sorry Lilith, but your message said that I would need a wheelbarrow? And those aren't exactly easy to find, haha. By the way, can you find a new way to get messages to me? Those [']thralls['] of yours are fucking weird, like seriously. I mean yeah, they sell pretty decently, but braindead sex zombies... creepy!' The succubus acknowledges what he said with a slight nod of her head, but her attention seems to be fixed on you, 'I'm going to assume that you being here isn't a social call, am I right?' With a firm nod of your head you tell her that it's pretty important, 'It always is isn't it? Well just let me wrap up this business arrangement and then I'm all yours.'

Her voice sounds almost vacant, like a practiced line that has been repeated time after time. Kev seems a little uncomfortable by her reply, 'Umm, yeah sure, that sounds like a decent enough reason. So uhh, lets talk payment.' The succubus rolls her eyes at his change in topics, 'You can just have him Kev, there is no need for payments.' The crimson demon pulls out a ratty looking notebook, 'Actually, I mean what your gonna pay for taking him. I mean it's nice of you to think of me for slaving needs, but I can already tell just by looking at this thing it's going to require a lot of extra work to take care of it. So either you gotta sell why I should take it.. or simply keep it. Sorry Lilith, you know how much I appreciate everything that you've done for me, but this is business.'";

With the stage set Lilith starts her pitch with a completely fake cheerful enthusiasm 'So first things first, look at this massive cock and balls, the perfect companion for any buyer than enjoys aromatic cum-baths for them and their friends, but wait there's more, are you tired of having to sleep on that hard cold ground? Well this model can also be used as a makeshift heated bed!' Kev drops his book on the ground as he bursts into laughter, 'Haha, alright Lilith come on be serious, there's no need to be a smart ass.'

The man once again starts struggling and attempts to inform Lilith that her mother was a whore, little does he know demons don't usually procreate in hell. The demoness quickly moves around towards his head and leans down, grabbing the head of his massive cock, she jams as much of it as she can inside of his mouth, 'Now be quite, the more you attempt to make a big scene the more pain you will be inflicting on yourself... not to mention I could simply make you blow your load down your own throat and if that happens, well then you could drown in a sea of your own cum, hehe.' The smile on her face could almost appear sweet, however the look of pure terror in the mans eyes causes both you and Kev to once again burst into a fit of laughter.";

I can spread a slight demonic taint to this thing, meaning that no matter what anyone does to it, it will remain pure human... well at least on the outside, hehe. And since I do appreciate you coming out all this way to take out the trash for me, I will also double the payments that you can receive from it, I just need you two to roll the thing over.' You have no idea how you got dragged into helping Kev, but it's probably better to do as she asks, after all you will be asking for her help later.

The skinny boy has no real muscle or meat on his bones, leaving him to look more like he's just laying there on a huge cock pillow. The succubus walks over to a table just outside of the candlelight and quickly returns with a vial of liquid and offers you a wink, 'My own special blend.' With that she pours a liberal amount into her delicate looking hands and quickly rubs them together. You don't know what you expected to happen next, but it certainly wasn't for Lilith to begin smacking the kids flat ass as hard as she can. With every strike of her hand you can hear the man's muffled screaming at the pain being inflicted on his backside, however as you watch what is happening you quickly realize that this isn't just about hurting the guy, his ass is actually becoming larger and more round with each hit.";

Not one to really follow the rules, the succubus offers one final hit to the already dark-red rear before backing off. At that moment you're able to hear the man sobbing into his dick head, while some small part of you may feel bad for what's happening to him, the larger part of you understands that this is his just reward for his arrogance. Finally catching her breath, Lilith swirls around on her heal to face you, 'Well I mean some people actually like a big ass I'll have you know, besides with the proper concoction you can alter any body parts size to suit the needs of a proper [master].'

With a snap of her fingers, the boys legs are instantly spread as far as they can, fully exposing him to the gaze of his viewers.

Looking around, you notice that neither of the demons have readied anything for your trip out to the burned out church, [if Morale of The-Voice is 2]'Are you two almost ready? We move out as soon as possible.' [else if Morale of The-Voice is 3]'Come on boys and move your asses, we've got places to be' [end if]Turning around to leave, intending to finish your own preparations, you come to a halt as neither demon makes any move to follow your orders.";

Raising a single eyebrow, you proceed to ask the demon why he shouldn't [if Morale of The-Voice is 2]have to follow orders. [else if Morale of The-Voice is 3]have to do as you command. [end if]'It isn't that I'm trying to go against your orders [master], but please understand where I'm coming from. Without my powers I'll be marked as a easy target... I have accepted my place under your ownership, but there are things out there that you have never encountered, things that...' Finally understanding what has Skarnoth acting so skittish, you think for a moment on the best way to handle the situation. Seeing the conflict on the demon's handsome tan face, you feel the need to reassure [if Morale of The-Voice is 2]him from his fears, [else if Morale of The-Voice is 3]your property of his fears, [end if]but the question is how to go about it.";

Even though the demon attempts to shrink away from your touch, you don't release the grip on him, '[Master]?' The look of fear in his eyes spurs you to speak, 'Skarnoth, you need to trust in both me and Brutus. I know that there are things in this world that we have yet to see firsthand, but we shall face them head-on, together.' Glancing over at the demon brute, he acknowledges your words with a firm nod of approval before his voice fills your mind, [italic type]'Wise words [master].'[roman type] Skarnoth seems to calm down slightly at your declaration and brings his own hand up to cover your own in an act of camaraderie. 'Alright [master], you're right. We can handle this, I just wish I knew how to be of use now that I'm so much weaker than I used to be.'";

	say "     Walking up to Skarnoth with a smoldering look in your eyes, you quickly pull him flush against your body and lay a searing kiss against his full lips. As the former master of hell finally leans in and begins to respond with an almost hungry desperation, your tongue quickly dominates the meeting of your two mouths. While this moment is about the intimacy between the two of you, it is also about showing the demon that it's alright to rely on you and trust in your judgement. Pulling back, you look deep into his lava colored eyes, within them you can see both devotion, but also a question. '[Master], what was that for?' Raising your hand up, you cup the side of his tan face and allow your fingertips to caress his crimson hair, 'Skarnoth this is my way of showing you that I care, and that I would never allow anything to happen to you.

to say EchiphonMpreg01:
	say "     Not really liking where this is going, you open your mouth and mention to the demoness that you have a pill that could keep the being male while still making it possible to knock him up. This seems to upset Lilith, as a frown soon graces her face, 'Why wouldn't you want it to have a pussy? I mean I guess it still gets the job done, but personally I think this pig could use a little bit more sow inside of it to truly understand the mistakes that it made.' Snickering softly to yourself, you make your way over towards the mans head. Crouching down, you grab him by his short jet-black hair and yank his dickhead from his mouth. Staring deeply into the blue tear-stained eyes of the boy, you proceed to ask him his name, 'My, my name is Arn-' You quickly interrupt him and explain that he no longer has a name, whatever or whoever he was before no longer matter, he will now live as the property of others. This of course leads the man into a fresh burst of tears, 'But... but I don't wanna be anyone's property!' You lightly caress the youth's pale face before softly cupping his cheek.";
	say "     You ask him if he remembers the demon that he met outside? 'You mean that fag that tried hitting on me? Yeah I remember him... Hey why don't you enslave him instead! I mean those animals like that sorta thing right?!' Your hand tightens around the boy's face causing his eyes to squinch up in pain and you slowly explain to him that the [']fag['] outside is your son... Realization dawns on his face at what this must mean for him, 'Please, I'm sorry and I swear I wont ever do it again, just please let me go!' Glancing over at Lilith, she is glaring daggers at the man and you would be lying if you were to say that you didn't agree with her rage. Calming yourself, you explain to him that even though he's wronged you, you intend to take pity on him and give him a gift. Pulling out one of the orc pills that you have, you show the youth the small light-green pill and tell him that this capsule is his only option to stay fully male.";

	say "     'Wait, but didn't you say something about it making it possible for me to still get knocked up? I don't wanna get pregnant! Besides, without a pussy no one can even have a baby!' You chuckle to yourself and explain to him that he has another hole that will grow a womb, 'Another hole! Wait you mean my ass! No you can't do that, I'm a virgin, you wouldn't do that to a virgin would you?!' The man's struggles begin anew, however this also gives you a proper opening and you jam the pill as far down his throat as you can. Quickly covering his mouth and nose, you inform him that it would be best to simply swallow his medicine, or he can try to fight you and be fed it while he's unconscious. While still crying the boy obediently swallows the pill, however you don't want him to forget the lesson that is meant to be learned here and leaning closer to his ear, you ask him how it feels to be a fag now? Standing up, you return to your earlier position with the others, a wicked grin on your face.";
