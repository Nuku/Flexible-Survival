	try looking;
	say "     Walking into the maintenance storeroom that now serves as your bedroom, the bed calls to you as the door closes, the stress of the day catching up to you. Tossing your bag onto the ground, you nearly collapse onto the small cot that now serves as your bed. Laying there and looking up at the ceiling, you start to feel the need for sleep almost like a heavy pressure behind your eyes. Listening to the familiar sounds of the library, you can make out someone softly having a conversation from above and a hard thud from outside your door, more than likely Brutus taking his place guarding you while you slumber. As your eyes begin to burn with the need to rest, you close them in an attempt to help hydrate them, however once you open them again, your vision is blurry, and you have to blink a few times to get your eyes to adjust. You quickly realize that something is wrong and sit up while looking around, The room was never very colorful to begin with, but now everything appears to be in shades of white, black, and gray, almost like one of those old-fashioned movies.";
	say "     Standing up from the cot, a lightheadedness sweeps through your mind causing you to grab onto one of the nearby shelves, and you wait for your equilibrium to finally settle. Once you feel alright to move, you begin to make your way for the door, each step feeling like gravity is pressing your body harder into the ground with much more intensity than it should. Finally at the door, you wrench it open, fully expecting to be met with Brutus's massive form, but instead you only see swirling black smoke beginning to creep through the open doorway. While investigating the anomaly, you stop just before the tendrils of smoke can make contact with your body. Contemplating on what to do next, you turn your head slowly and look behind you at the small storeroom. You notice that while its appearance may have changed, it's still somewhere that you've marked as your own, and it still has that air of safety to it.";

	say "     [bold type]Do you want to lay back down in the safety of your cot?[roman type][line break]";

	if Player consents: [This will eliminate the Master of Mell quest from continuing]
		LineBreak;
		say "     Taking a single step away from the swirling darkness, you turn around and make your way back to the small cot. Laying your head down on the small pillow, you close your eyes and do your best to focus on trying to wake up. Your own personal scent surrounds you but underneath that you can make out the smell of both Brutus and Skarnoth. Slowing your breathing and allowing your mind to go back to that moment the three of you shared, a strange static sound starts to build from within your mind until finally it becomes almost painful and jolts you completely upright in shock. Glancing around, you realize that the colors are back to normal, and in your attempt to get up, you almost fall off the cot. Rushing to the door and wrenching it open, you almost run right into Brutus's firm back and quickly wrap your arms around the demon brute as he turns around to face you. Finally pulling back, you happily inform him how grateful you are to see him. The only response you are met with is a single raised eyebrow, followed by a look of confusion.";
		say "     'Why can't I reach into your mind, [master]? Have you finally learned how to keep others out?' Confused yourself, you just stare at Brutus with your mouth hanging open, that is until you notice something different about his throat... Your bite mark is gone. The brute's face quickly clouds over with something akin to fear, the facial expression looking alien and out of place on your dark knight's visage. A ear-splitting roar bursts from Brutus's mouth, causing you to take a reflexive step back. Before you're able to ask him what's wrong, he interrupts you, 'What did you do?! My whole body feels like it's on fire again! You promised that the pain would end!' You don't know what to say, your jaw hanging open as you think of how to respond. 'You are liar!' Watching as the demon attempts to formulate his words, it's almost like the pain is too great for him to focus. 'You're not [master], you prey!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A clawed hand swipes down at your face, but before you're able to duck down, it stops just short of colliding. The look of rage and betrayal never wavers from the demon brute's intense gaze. 'I... will... destroy... you!' With one final roar, Brutus bursts into a cloud of purple smoke and is sucked back into the pendant that you had promised that he would never have to return to. Trying to make sense of what exactly just happened, you're once again pulled from your thoughts as Skarnoth rushes down the stairs of the bunker. '[Master], what was that sound?! It sounded like Brutus was shouting about something.' Opening your mouth to explain what just happened, it quickly snaps shut as your eyes lock onto the royal incubus's throat... His mark is gone as well. '[Master], what's wrong? You don't look so good.' A strange flash washes over Skarnoth's face, just like it did with Brutus, causing his eyes to roll into the back of his head briefly. 'I... don't feel very well, [master].'";
		say "     The demon slumps to the floor and ragged breaths start to escape his chest. Remembering what happened with Brutus and how whatever gift that was passed onto him must have reverted somehow, you quickly leap into action and reach out to help the formal royal to his feet. Doing your best, you attempt to get the demon up the stairs of the bunker and back to his chair as fast as possible. Once he's seated, his breathing finally begins to return to normal, although he still appears slightly out of it. Not knowing what else to do, you start to explain to Skarnoth what had happened with Brutus and then to himself. 'Wait, Brutus? You mean that drooling beast that you enslaved?' You gape slightly and then proceed to ask why he would say that about someone that he apparently was able to form a bond of brotherhood with. 'A bond of brotherhood? You must be joking, [master]. I've never even talked with that animal.' It's almost as if the submissive demon somehow forgot everything that took place after you began to place those bite marks the hellspawn in your possession.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     While processing what all of this could mean, a voice calls out from behind you, 'Is everything alright?' It's Elijah, his expression warm while meeting your gaze, but quickly turns cold as he takes in Skarnoth. 'You had best be staying out of trouble, demon, because if I find out otherwise, I will put you down before you can do any further damage.' The exhausted incubus merely mocks the angel and waves him off. Just as it looks as if Elijah's about to retaliate, you step in and explain to the angel that everything is fine and that you were simply checking in on him. With a shake of his head, the divine being's only response is, 'Don't pay these demons any mind. Remember that they are nothing but monsters, incapable of actually feeling anything other than the desire to destroy everything that they can.' With that, the angel gives you a slight smile and exits the room, leaving you to wonder if what Elijah said is true. A darker thought is quick to follow. If that's true then what does that make you, someone who gave them hope and a possible reason to feel, only to somehow rip it all away and erase those moments...";

		say "     Steeling your nerves, you take a confident step forward, allowing the shadows to twist and wrap around your body, caressing your form. However, the further you walk into the seemingly endless darkness, the tighter the grip of the tendrils become, feeling almost as if they are attempting to halt your progress. After what feel like hours of walking, you finally are able to make out a light further ahead and using all of your strength, you push on, finally freeing yourself from the shadow tentacles that have slithered around your form. As you finally burst free, your eyes are hit with the dim light of the room, causing a grunt of pain to escape your lips. Bringing your hand up to offer them shelter from the brightness, you try to allow them to adjust to the contrast in light. Once you're able to look around without your eyes stinging, you can see that you're standing on what appears to be a strange plateau surrounded by swirling smoke. Turning back, you notice that the doorway that you came through has somehow vanished into thin air.";
		say "     Looking out across the vast emptiness, you can't help but wonder if passing through that door was the right choice. A slight tingle starts at the base of your skull and progressively makes its way down the rest of your spine. It's a familiar feeling, almost as if you're being watched. Whirling around in an attempt to catch whatever was spying on you, you're met with a haunting chuckle, well if you can even call it that, the sound being somewhere between the sound of a lunatic's ravings mixed with the sound of a wounded animal screeching. What you're met with is a semi-transparent shadow. At first, you aren't sure what to make of this discovery. While it's shocking to see a sentient shade, your time in the city has also taught you to pay attention to your surroundings. Looking closer at it, there is no way to figure out what exactly it's supposed to be a shadow of or if this thing even has a gender. A mouth forms on what you can only assume must be the shade's face, sharp, jagged teeth protruding outward from the freshly formed orifice.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Two bright-yellow orbs begin to travel up the being's form, passing by the long tentacles of darkness all around its body, eventually becoming lifeless-looking eyes that wobble back and forth, making this thing appear even more unsettling. The creature smiles at you, something that may have been intended to put you at ease, however it causes quite the opposite, and you enter a defensive position instead. 'Haha, well that's certainly rude, don't you think? Here I am, trying to help you be more comfortable and what's my thanks? You act as if you're going to attack me, buhaha.' The being looks absolutely giddy by your actions, meaning it either wants a fight, or it views your antics as hardly a threat and silly.";

'I see that your arrogance is certainly something to be admired, especially considering the fact that you have no idea who or what I am... or what I may be capable of, and still you think that you can just pummel me into submission.' The being rises higher off the ground, dark tendrils emerging from the base of its form, each with their own private mouths that seemingly propel the creature's movement. Before you can react, the tentacled shadow begins to circle around you, maniacal laughter coming from every angle. While it's hard to focus on the beast itself, what with all of that shrieking piercing your ears, you finally thrust a fist outward and it appears to connect with... nothing. Your hand simply moved through the shades body, 'There, see? Wasn't that a fun little game to play? It's always fun to make new friends, don't you think?' Returning to its original spot, the shade continues to speak, 'As you can plainly see, I can't be touched. I am a being of the void. Think of it as a place that exists between the dream world and the real one.'";
			say "     Long clawed hands creep up from the being's side and cover its mouth as it continues to giggle. 'More power will be needed before you can beat anything into submission, little [master].' The term [master] catches you off guard, your thoughts instantly turning to both Skarnoth and Brutus. The two of them have both been using that term a lot recently. You are pulled from your thoughts by a deep guttural rumble. 'This goes deeper than your little pets. They are merely tools to achieve an even greater ambition, well if you're strong enough to claim it that is.' Knowing full well that the names of your demons, or even their existence, never passed from your lips, you raise an eyebrow at the shade. The only reply that you're given is simply more cackling.";

The being rises higher off the ground, dark tendrils emerging from the base of its form, each with their own private mouths that seemingly propel the creature's movement. Before you can react, the tentacled shadow begins to circle around you, maniacal laughter coming from every angle.

		say "     A slimy purple tongue emerges from between serrated teeth, licking the thing's non-existent lips. 'The truth is, while dreams are tasty, each filled with the hopes of mortals, nightmares are far more... delicious. All that fear, the adrenaline just under the surface, screaming to break free...' A vile-looking white mucus begins to drip from the shade's mouth. 'But I digress. Right now, we shouldn't be talking about my feeding habits, instead we should be discussing a potential symbiotic relationship that could be formed.' The disbelief has to be evident on your face. The way this creature jumps from topic to topic seems to have no real reason to it, almost as if it were purposefully attempting to be confusing. For the first time, the shade actually appears as if it's becoming frustrated. 'I suppose that since [']I['] already know the score, I never really expected that I would have to explain myself properly. How tedious. Well, even I can admit when I should be helping a lesser being to understand what should be obvious.'";
		say "     Finally finding your voice, you ask the creature for its name. 'Name?' The shade quickly looks down at one of its tentacles and half whispers in anger, 'No, not your name! The liberator asked my [']name['], you fool... No, I already told you that you can watch, but no touching!' Taking a step backwards, you can't be sure whether this thing is simply crazed, or if there is something else here that you simply can't see. Your movement however pulls the creature's attention. 'Ah yes, a name. Well I don't particularly like the idea of names. They are simply a method of control. You see, knowledge is power, and I don't much care for the thought of anyone having that sort of power over me. However, perhaps a different type of transaction can be made, hmm?' The whining sound that it ended its question with sends a chill down your spine, along with the fact that apparently this thing thinks that you're some kind of liberator.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The shade either doesn't notice, or simply doesn't care about the effect that it is having on you. 'Now, what could I offer you?' The way that the shadow talks makes it sound as if it already knows [']exactly['] what it plans on saying. 'This place is my own personal creation, somewhere that has a pull all of its own. You see, when mortals close their eyes, enter dreamland, and are full of intense emotions, their essence can find its way here.' Looking around at the vacant area, you aren't sure that you're able to hide how unimpressed you are by the place's appearance. 'Well what do you think of this space? I'm sure that it's a little bland by mortal standards, but maybe something could be done about that. If you could have a domain of your very own, what sort of residents would you enjoy watching?";
		say "     Silence fills the air between the two of you, as you're not really sure what they mean or how you should answer them. 'What I mean is that if I were to simply give you this realm, purely as an example mind you, what sort of dreamers would you want to see visit?' The condescending tone of the shade's voice causes your hackles to raise. 'I mean in simple terms, would someone like you prefer a world filled with beautiful females? Perhaps a paradise of manliness and testosterone? Or maybe you're someone that can find the pleasure in a little bit of everything, hmm?' A shudder goes through you before all of what the creature said sinks in. A world of your own choosing?";

Truth be told, I suppose I could see how adding a bit of [']flavor['] could help this place be less boring for a mortal.' A feeling of embarrassment washes over you at the idea that you actually played into this thing's game, but the shadow doesn't seem to be judging your choices, instead finding the whole situation more amusing than anything. Growing tired of the games that this creature is playing, you quickly shout at the shade to get to the point, demanding to know exactly why you're here! 'Tut-tut, that's a rather rude way to ask a question, don't you think? Besides, why should I tell you... when I can simply show you!' With lightning speed, the creature rushes at you, however rather than the impact that you're expecting, it fades into your body instead.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A shrieking laugh fills your head until it is the only thing that you can focus on, causing you to become dizzy, and you drop to your knees with nausea. Shaking your head and taking a few deep breaths, you stand up and brace yourself for whatever trick that shadow has planned. A light behind you catches your attention. Spinning around, you are met with a very familiar sight, although you have never seen it quite from [']this['] perspective. Looking forward, you can see a battlefield frozen in time. Both you and Skarnoth are in the heat of battle, grimaced mouths shouting out in silent rage. From inside your head, a voice vibrates through your skull 'I see that you remember this battle. The moment that you chose to get involved in things that were not your concern, and in doing so, decided the fate of this city... and perhaps much more.' Glancing at Skarnoth, it's almost like looking at someone totally different than the demon you've become used too. 'The demon prince was well on his way to claiming your realm. He had amassed his entire army in preparation.'";
		say "     The image hardens into ash, only to crumble and  reform with the scene of you clasping the slave collar around the former royal demon's throat. 'The way leadership works in Hell is that when one master falls, the next in the bloodline absorbs the discarded energy and is able to take the throne. However, by sparing and enslaving him instead, you trapped his power.' Everything around you fades to black, until a scene unfolds: a huge hall filled with more demons than you can count. They all appear to be cheering and celebrating, however at the far back of the room is a large throne. A demon that looks surprising like Skarnoth is slumped over the side and judging by the wound to his throat, he's already dead. 'So now there are leaderless demons raging against the barrier to your realm and an empty throne that your pet's younger sibling could never properly fill.' Hearing that Skarnoth has a little brother shocks you since the last time you talked on the subject, he claimed that demons didn't have any brothers, but then again perhaps he didn't even know. Taking a deep breath at the thought of having to tell Skarnoth about his brother, you realize that you can't seem to suck in any oxygen.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Hacking and coughing, black smoke starts to pour out of every orifice that you have, centering in a single spot until it coalesces into the shade's original form 'So now you know the truth. The demons will break the barrier and swarm the city. Left unchecked, they will spread like a plague across your world... and it's all your fault, haha.' Without thinking, you rush at the shadow, your fist already pulled back and ready to strike. A single clawed hand rises, causing your entire body to freeze in place. 'You really are going to learn how to keep that rage in check, besides there is one other option. You see, fate had already decreed that the current Master of Hell would have won, or that he would have been killed by a being of light. You know what that means, right?' Your mind starts trying to piece the information together. Basically, what this thing is saying is that someone should have died, either Skarnoth or Elijah.";
		say "     'This is why I hate mortals. They always think about [']people['] rather than the big picture... You! You were not part of fate's design and thus you changed it!' Turning to the side, the shade once again mutters something to someone that you can't see. 'I know, I know, it can't help that it's a lower life form.' The creature finally calms down again and turns back to address you. 'Let me try to explain. Let's say that fate is a riddle, alright? The riddle is something like, what walks on four legs in the morning, two during the day, and three at night? Any normal person would answer that it's obviously the victim of a killer that is adding and removing parts for fun, but you might answer something ridiculous, like the life stages of a human being. That's what you are: an anomaly that makes no sense!' Personally, you think the shadow's answer is the more idiotic one, but you don't say anything, instead waiting for it to continue.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'I'm sure that you have noticed certain marks appearing on your pets, almost like a brand? Well that's your personal mark. By breaking the former Master of Hell, you've somehow inherited a part of his power. I brought you here to guide you in how to help it grow.' Finally you open your mouth to speak, the question on your tongue being why you would want their help, or better yet why they would want to help you. 'Oh, that's simple, either your power grows, or the beings that you seem to care so much about, yourself included, will be destroyed. As to your other question... I'm just a helpful sort of demon, that's all, haha!' The comment is made so simply, as if the creature is commenting on nothing more than the weather. 'Oh come now. If anything, you should be thrilled that I'm saying there is a shred of hope, hehe! Then again, saying a shred is still overselling your abilities by a great deal.' The warped smile on the being's face makes you want nothing more than to bash in each and every tooth.";
		say "     'The first act of generosity on my part is that I will give you this space for your own personal use, well as long as you understand that I will still be feeding from your pool.' You ask what they mean exactly by [']feeding[']? 'Only their energy. They may wake a little more tired than usual, but will be otherwise unaffected. Now, what was the next question I had planned?' The ground erupts as a huge stone monolith rises up with something already written on its surface. Taking a closer look, you can make out the roman numeral for one and next to that is the list of genders you seem to be interested in. 'Ah yes, well I know that you mortals are suckers for a good theme, so why don't we choose one for this little dark sanctum of yours, haha. Be warned though, only one can be chosen, well for now at least. These things take up a lot of energy to maintain, and you will need to amass much more energy to gain more. Before you start asking questions, yes, I can do anything within this space, regardless of the genders that you desire.'";

The shade turns its attention back towards the monolith, its long clawed fingers clicking together in a contemplative manner as it seems to be analyzing the huge stone tablet. 'Hmm, there are only two other topics that are in need of immediate attention. The first is a power base: you are going to need somewhere to build up your strength, somewhere with a natural connection to darkness.' Opening your mouth to speak, you comment on the fact that there is a burnt out church nearby that already has demons dwelling within. 'No, that simply won't do. Remember that this path will lead to you gaining many new enemies, and as such, you will need a much more defensive position. Lucky for you, I have already found the perfect location!' The creature's excitement puts your nerves on edge, but just the same, you ask the shadow to continue.";
	say "     'It just so happens that a huge demonic relic has arrived in the east part of the city, an ancient citadel that is the very incarnation of evil. It must have risen out of Hell from underneath the lava beds there. A word of warning though, it did not arrive alone... It would seem that a few demons must have been attempting to ride it as a means to breach your realm.' Rolling your eyes, you ask the shade if they are expecting you to fight your way through an army of demons to claim this relic? 'Well of course, but like all things in this world, it shall be easier said than done. The demons that [']were['] inhabiting the citadel well... they're all dead. Which is great news for you, however something much more dangerous has decided to claim the building for itself.' The shade comes closer and wraps its arm around you, and an extreme feeling of nausea floods throughout your stomach.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The creature quickly pulls its hand back and retreats a bit further away. 'Sorry about that, little [master]. I always forget that mortals don't do well with my touch. Anyways, as I was saying, there are many different types of hells, each with their own unique outlook on the world of mortals. The beast that has claimed our citadel is from one such place. His name is Shuten Dōji, an oni of considerable power. Thankfully for you though, his name says it all as he is quite the drunkard. You will have to approach this enemy with slightly different methods than you're probably used too. The truth is that this beast can't be outright killed... well it can, but he would simply pop right back up. Trust me, he's been killed before and that didn't stop him in the slightest. Also something to keep in mind is that he will be guarded by his troops of fellow oni and kijo, so don't underestimate this endeavor.'";
	say "     Rising high up into the air, the shade begins to explain the next aspect of what you will need for victory. 'Besides claiming the citadel, you will be needing to... acquire five very important allies to our cause. The first two are already in your possession, that brute and his former master will do nicely, however you will also need to find another [']natural['] demon. That should be your first goal since they will most likely prove useful in taking the relic. Afterwards though, we will need two demons that were born human, so keep an eye out on your travels. You will also have to force ascension onto the five at some point. Think of it as a form of... demonic evolution that will increase their power. To do this, you will need to share your strength with them, either by blood or sexual fluids, your choice. As each one awakens, they will become your lords of Hell, an essential piece of the puzzle.' Gliding down, the shade floats right in front of your face 'So, what do you think? Do we have a deal?' Somehow, everything about this question, makes it feel as if this is a moment that you will never be able to take back.";

Straightening back up, the shade looks directly at you, its normally wobbly eyes now completely still. 'I have been watching you for a while now, and I have seen the way you deal with situations.

Glancing around, you realize that the colors are back to normal, and in your attempt to get up, you almost fall off the cot. Rushing to the door and wrenching it open, you almost run right into Brutus's firm back and quickly wrap your arms around the demon brute as he turns around to face you. Finally pulling back, you happily inform him how grateful you are to see him, but the only response you are met with is a single raised eyebrow followed by a look of confusion.";

A ear-splitting roar bursts from Brutus's mouth, causing you to take a reflexive step back. Before you're able to ask him what's wrong, he interrupts you, 'What did you do?! My whole body feels like it's on fire again! You promised that the pain would end!' You don't know what to say, your jaw hanging open as you think of how to respond. 'You are liar!'

Trying to make sense of what exactly just happened, you're once again pulled from your thoughts as Skarnoth rushes down the stairs of the bunker. '[Master], what was that sound?! It sounded like Brutus was shouting about something.' Opening your mouth to explain what just happened, it quickly snaps shut as your eyes lock onto the royal incubus's throat... His mark is gone as well. '[Master], what's wrong? You don't look so good.'

Remembering what happened with Brutus and how whatever gift that was passed onto him must have reverted somehow, you quickly leap into action and reach out to help the formal royal to his feet. Doing your best, you attempt to get the demon up the stairs of the bunker and back to his chair as fast as possible. Once he's seated, his breathing finally begins to return to normal, although he still appears slightly out of it. Not knowing what else to do, you start to explain to Skarnoth what had happened with Brutus and then to himself. 'Wait, Brutus? You mean that drooling beast that you enslaved?' You gape slightly and then proceed to ask why he would say that about someone that he apparently was able to form a bond of brotherhood with. 'A bond of brotherhood? You must be joking, [master].

The exhausted incubus merely mocks the angel and waves him off. Just as it looks as if Elijah's about to retaliate, you step in and explain to the angel that everything is fine and that you were simply checking in on him. With a shake of his head, the divine being's only response is, 'Don't pay these demons any mind. Remember that they are nothing but monsters, incapable of actually feeling anything other than the desire to destroy everything that they can.' With that, the angel gives you a slight smile and exits the room, leaving you to wonder if what Elijah said is true. A darker thought is quick to follow.

With the demon brute's back to you, it's hard not to notice the way his huge purple ass shakes and jiggles.

Looking over at the former royal you can see the mirth in his lava eyes and the two of you burst into a fit of laughter that has you holding your sides.

However, this is not the smartest choice as you and Skarnoth are embracing the moment of immaturity. With your heads hanging over his back you are presented with the source of your amusement and eventually start a mini competition of reaching down and forcing each cheek to jiggle every time the demon takes a step.

While Brutus is definitely a being of darkness, it's refreshing to see that even [']he['] still has a small amount of innocence... at least in this particular situation.

Obviously noticing that your eyebrows raised at that information, he continues talking, 'The magic used on the pendant was made to lower my strength, at first the miasma was in the air constantly surrounding me, but after you marked me, it started to become a light powder that could easily be shaken off.' Well that's definitely something that you should have known about sooner, but there will be time to get into that later.

Brutus however doesn't seem to be enjoying the new information, 'So you both were laughing at me? At the fact that you think my butt is too big?' The look on his face his hard to read, but it definitely doesn't look please. You attempt to calm your dark knight down and explain that it was just a silly moment, however Brutus brushes your assurances aside and comments on the fact that your group really should be heading to the church instead of just standing around.

Brutus eventually speak up, '[Master], didn't you say that the succubus was needed to claim the relic? If so, then I recommend we hurry, that scream didn't sound like a good sign.'

Before you can open your mouth to respond, you're immediately grappled with a tight bear hug, 'Daddy, I'm so glad you came to visit me! You have no idea how boring it is to have to guard the door while [']she's['] busy in there and doesn't wanna be disturbed.'

'Of course not! This guy wishes that he could be like one of those studs haha. No, he looked like one of the guys in those machine magazines, ya'know where they build stuff? He even had those really big glasses and suspenders! Although the cape he was wearing was kinda strange.'

You ask him why exactly was he trying to be nice to this guy in the first place? 'Oh, cuz if he can build stuff, then he could prolly build me a super sweet fuck machine!' You don't have the heart to tell him that it still sounds like he has sex on the brain, 'Can I finish my story now without all the questions?' Making a motion of zipping your lips, you nod for him to continue, 'So yeah, he was an asshole, he went in, there was a lot of screaming and then [']she['] came out and told me to keep people from bothering her... mphtch' While it's muffled and you can't quite make out the last word that was said, it sounded an awful lot like bitch.

Atticus begins to poke and prod the other two hellspawn, which the demon brute doesn't seem to mind to much, however the former Master of Hell is less than happy about all the touching. 'Hey daddy? Since you like, own them and everything, is it alright if I use them?' A laugh erupts from your chest at how truly insatiable your offspring is, 'Tell ya what, how about I go deal with your mother, and I'll think on it?'

The look on your son's face is an odd mix of excitement and fear, you pull the young man close to you and whisper in his ear, 'Maybe I would, I bet that you'd be pretty tasty!'

Atticus responds with a roll of his eyes, 'Dad, you know I'm an adult right? I can take care of myself!' With a chuckle you send out a mental message to your demons, [italic type]'You two keep him safe, and one wrong move in touching him... will not go unpunished.'[roman type] Brutus nods firmly while Skarnoth scoffs, but you can tell that he knows that you're not joking.";

Skarnoth has an annoyed look on his face, but the reddening of his cheeks betrays his true feelings about being seen as family. Brutus though, you can't remember ever seeing such a look of pride on his demonic visage, while most would probably assume that he was furious, you know better, this is the look of one truly ecstatic demon. Atticus begins to poke and prod the other two hellspawn, which the demon brute doesn't seem to mind, even going so far as to awkwardly pat the much smaller incubus on the head, which is rewarded with a beaming smile from your son. The demon brute's fanged mouth opens in a smile and his voice comes out as a soft growl, '[Master], your offspring is certainly a curious one isn't he?'";

A vein begins to pulse on the formal royal's forehead, '[Master], there is no way that this annoying little creature could share your bloodline!' This however causes Atticus's smile to disappear and become replaced with a vicious snarl, 'Oh yeah?! Well at least I don't have some huge set of horns that make me look like some big dumb cow slut!'

You can tell that the topic got under your sons skin, Atticus then walks back over to you and without thinking much on it you wrap him up in your arms. Glancing back at Skarnoth you see an almost pained smile form on his lips and through the mental link ask him if he's alright, [italic type]'Of course [master], he just... reminds me of someone is all.'

And not a hair on his head had better be out of place when I come back out. Also keep your dicks to yourselves got it?' Brutus looks mortified that you would even feel the need to mention that last part, but Skarnoth simply inspects his claws and comments that he has higher standards. Before you can reprimand the former royal for his response, Atticus comes running back with a large box... filled with an ungodly amount porn. Once the incubus is closer he finally sets the box down, he rushes over to his [']uncles['] and begins to pull them closer.

The stickers are obviously old and covered in dust, some are hearts and others are stars, you can't stop yourself from asking if their is a difference, which leads to the incubus's face gaping like a fish 'Of course there's a difference daddy! Stars are for people that would be decent cumdumps and hearts are for ones with harem potential.' With that your son peels a heart sticker off and with a smile places it against Brutus's pec, 'See like that?' Brutus's expression is priceless, the normally dangerous and clawed hand gently feels the pathetic sticker on his skin, but treats it like it's something precious.

Skarnoth looks ready to spit bullets, but Brutus nods his head in a sage like way, either because he is humoring your son, or because now he is actually starting to wonder if Atticus is right about Skarnoth being some sort of demonic cow. Shaking your head at the image they all make, you can't keep the smile off of your face and tell them, 'You boys be good while I take care of business alright?'";

Eventually you're able to catch a glimpse of candlelight just ahead of you and make your way towards it, finally entering the inner sanctum of the building, you are surprised by the sight that awaits you. You see Lilith standing off to the side, her stance and posture reminding you more of a regal queen, rather than just a simple succubus. Then again, just with what little you have learned about her through the memories that you've experienced, it's doubtful that there could be anything really [']simple['] about her. That's not the surprising part though, that would be what is laying on the ground a few feet away from her. Looking down at the... [']object['], it's basically just a huge cock laying on the ground, the only movement from it is an occasional throb. At first it appears to be one of those creepy cock cannon creatures, but as you peer closer, you realize that this thing still has a body underneath it's massive prick.";
	say "     The look on Lilith's face is one of annoyance and she leisurely strides over to the person on the floor, her heels clicking with each step towards... well as much of a person as is left that is, 'What's wrong stud? I thought you were going to come in here and claim some slut as your concubine, at least that's what you told my son...' The man starts to struggle from underneath his oversized appendage, while slightly muffled you are still able to make out the words of his screaming voice, 'You fucking psycho bitch! Change my dick back to normal, right goddamn now!' The succubus giggles slightly into the back of her hand, most likely at the simple fact that a mortal would make demands of her. She gracefully raises one leg up and plants her heel on top of one of his massive testicles, 'But I thought you wanted to be larger? Your mind revealed your true desire and I quote, [']I wish I had a bitch-breaker dick, then I could I could show everyone what a real man I am and how I deserve all of their sluts for my harem['].

While the building is still pretty dark, you can make out the face of a darker skinned demon, the only parts of him that really stand out are his horns, and the multiple piercings across his face that glisten in the candlelight. Before you can respond though, Lilith's lyrical voice can be heard, 'Come in Kev, you [']do['] realize that your late don't you?' Well if she knows that he's here then she must have also realized that you had arrived as well. The two of you step further into the room, finally within the circle of candles everything does seem a bit brighter, oddly enough the demon attempts to discreetly sniff you as he walks by.";

'Sorry Lilith, but your message said that I would need a wheelbarrow? And those aren't exactly easy to find, haha. By the way, can you find a new way to get messages to me? Those [']thralls['] of yours are fucking weird, like seriously. I mean yeah, they sell pretty decently, but braindead sex zombies... creepy!' The succubus acknowledges what he said with a slight nod of her head, but her attention seems to be fixed on you, 'I'm going to assume that you being here isn't a social call, am I right?' With a firm nod of your head you tell her that it's pretty important, 'It always is isn't it? Well just let me wrap up this business arrangement and then I'm all yours.' The wink that she sends your way, on anyone else would seem corny, but for some reason coming from her it's charming.";

Her voice sounds almost vacant, like a practiced line that has been repeated time after time. Kev seems a little uncomfortable by her reply, 'Umm, yeah sure, that sounds like a decent enough reason. So uhh, lets talk payment.' The succubus rolls her eyes at his change in topics, 'You can just have him Kev, there is no need for payments.' The crimson demon pulls out a ratty looking notebook, 'Actually, I mean what your gonna pay for taking him. I mean it's nice of you to think of me for slaving needs, but I can already tell just by looking at this thing it's going to require a lot of extra work to take care of it. So either you gotta sell why I should take it.. or simply keep it. Sorry Lilith, you know how much I appreciate everything that you've done for me, but this is business.'";

With the stage set Lilith starts her pitch with a completely fake cheerful enthusiasm 'So first things first, look at this massive cock and balls, the perfect companion for any buyer than enjoys aromatic cum-baths for them and their friends, but wait there's more, are you tired of having to sleep on that hard cold ground? Well this model can also be used as a makeshift heated bed!' Kev drops his book on the ground as he bursts into laughter, 'Haha, alright Lilith come on be serious, there's no need to be a smart ass.'

The man once again starts struggling and attempts to inform Lilith that her mother was a whore, little does he know demons don't usually procreate in hell. The demoness quickly moves around towards his head and leans down, grabbing the head of his massive cock, she jams as much of it as she can inside of his mouth, 'Now be quite, the more you attempt to make a big scene the more pain you will be inflicting on yourself... not to mention I could simply make you blow your load down your own throat and if that happens, well then you could drown in a sea of your own cum, hehe.' The smile on her face could almost appear sweet, however the look of pure terror in the mans eyes causes both you and Kev to once again burst into a fit of laughter.";

I can spread a slight demonic taint to this thing, meaning that no matter what anyone does to it, it will remain pure human... well at least on the outside, hehe. And since I do appreciate you coming out all this way to take out the trash for me, I will also double the payments that you can receive from it, I just need you two to roll the thing over.' You have no idea how you got dragged into helping Kev, but it's probably better to do as she asks, after all you will be asking for her help later.

The skinny boy has no real muscle or meat on his bones, leaving him to look more like he's just laying there on a huge cock pillow. The succubus walks over to a table just outside of the candlelight and quickly returns with a vial of liquid and offers you a wink, 'My own special blend.' With that she pours a liberal amount into her delicate looking hands and quickly rubs them together. You don't know what you expected to happen next, but it certainly wasn't for Lilith to begin smacking the kids flat ass as hard as she can. With every strike of her hand you can hear the man's muffled screaming at the pain being inflicted on his backside, however as you watch what is happening you quickly realize that this isn't just about hurting the guy, his ass is actually becoming larger and more round with each hit.";

Not one to really follow the rules, the succubus offers one final hit to the already dark-red rear before backing off. At that moment you're able to hear the man sobbing into his dick head, while some small part of you may feel bad for what's happening to him, the larger part of you understands that this is his just reward for his arrogance. Finally catching her breath, Lilith swirls around on her heal to face you, 'Well I mean some people actually like a big ass I'll have you know, besides with the proper concoction you can alter any body parts size to suit the needs of a proper [master].' Her gaze bores into you for a moment as those words pass her lips.

With a snap of her fingers, the boys legs are instantly spread as far as they can, fully exposing him to the gaze of his viewers. A muffled sob can be heard as the man once again attempts to struggle to get away. Sensuously, the succubus drops down to her knees and begins to lightly caress the area right behind his testicles, 'What if I a place a tight little virgin cunt right here?

	say "     Walking up to Skarnoth with a look indignation on your face, with a single hand you grab one of his horns and push the former master of hell down to a kneeling position. Looking down into the demon's fearful eyes you allow a cruel smile to form on your lips, 'Listen up slut, I keep you around because you're a decent [if player is male]cocksleeve, [else]dildo, [end if] it's past the time that you have learned your place. Let's be honest here, I beat you, the master of hell and then enslaved you as my bitch, so whatever is out there I think I can handle.' From behind you a snicker can be heard from Brutus. Tears start to form in Skarnoth's lava colored eyes, 'Yes [master], I understand and your right. Just... please don't hurt me.'";

Part 7 - Echiphon's Mpreg Gain Scene
[add trait for him being Mpregable]

to say EchiphonMpreg01
	say "     Not really liking where this is going, you open your mouth and mention to the demoness that you have a pill that could keep the being male while still making it possible to knock him up. This seems to upset Lilith, as a frown soon graces her face, 'Why wouldn't you want it to have a pussy? I mean I guess it still gets the job done, but personally I think this pig could use a little bit more sow inside of it to truly understand the mistakes that it made.' Snickering softly to yourself, you make your way over towards the mans head. Crouching down, you grab him by his short jet-black hair and yank his dickhead from his mouth. Staring deeply into the blue tear-stained eyes of the boy, you proceed to ask him his name, 'My, my name is Arn-' You quickly interrupt him and explain that he no longer has a name, whatever or whoever he was before no longer matter, he will now live as the property of others. This of course leads the man into a fresh burst of tears, 'But... but I don't wanna be anyone's property!' You lightly caress the youth's pale face before softly cupping his cheek.";
	say "     You ask him if he remembers the demon that he met outside? 'You mean that fag that tried hitting on me? Yeah I remember him... Hey why don't you enslave him instead! I mean those animals like that sorta thing right?!' Your hand tightens around the boy's face causing his eyes to squinch up in pain and you slowly explain to him that the [']fag['] outside is your son... Realization dawns on his face at what this must mean for him, 'Please, I'm sorry and I swear I wont ever do it again, just please let me go!' Glancing over at Lilith, she is glaring daggers at man and you would be lying if you were to say that you didn't agree with her rage. Calming yourself, you explain to him that even though he's wronged you, you intend to take pity on him and give him a gift. Pulling out one of the orc pills that you have, you show the youth the small light-green pill and tell him that this capsule is his only option to stay fully male.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Wait, but didn't you say something about it making it possible for me to still get knocked up? I don't wanna get pregnant! Besides, without a pussy no one can even have a baby!' You chuckle to yourself and explain to him that he has another hole that will grow a womb, 'Another hole! Wait you mean my ass! No you can't do that, I'm a virgin, you wouldn't do that to a virgin would you?!' The man's struggles begin anew, however this also gives you a proper opening and you jam the pill as far down his throat as you can. Quickly covering his mouth and nose, you inform him that it would be best to simply swallow his medicine, or he can try to fight you and be fed it while he's unconscious. While still crying the boy obediently swallows the pill, however you don't want him to forget the lesson that is meant to be learned here and leaning closer to his ear, you ask him how it feels to be a fag now? Standing up, you return to your earlier position with the others, a wicked grin on your face.";

	say "     Lilith begins to talk to Kev about trivial things such as color, shape, the size that the clit should be, basically things that would matter to potential buyers. You watch as the words of their conversation seem to make the youth's body tremble in fear, snickering softly to yourself, you make your way over towards the mans head. Crouching down, you grab him by his short jet-black hair and yank his dickhead from his mouth. Staring deeply into the blue tear-stained eyes of the boy, you proceed to ask him his name, 'My, my name is Arn-' You quickly interrupt him and explain that he no longer has a name, whatever or whoever he was before no longer matter, he will now live as the property of others.

Calming yourself, you explain to him that what he has done was wrong and how when people do bad things, they must also be ready to pay the price. With a cruel smile on your lips, you ask the youth if he's excited about gaining a tight little virgin cunt? 'Noooo! I don't want to have a pussy, I haven't ever had sex before and now your telling that I have to get a vagina?!'";
