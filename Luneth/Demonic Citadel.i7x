The path of the citadel will originally be a dungeon that will follow a strict line that will cover 4-6 zones. There will be multiple ways to go about this from subterfuge all the way to violence. the subterfuge route will involve Atticus and Lilith teaming up for seduction, where the violent path will have them more akin to assassins with knocking people out rather than outright killing someone. At the end of the quest it will end with either Atticus or Lilith ascending as a new lord of hell. The scene will be completely different depending on your choice, you will have either the broodmother Lilith route or the incest corrupting Atticus route. These will leave you with very different yet mutually exclusive content, thankfully they are very self explanatory. The main point of this is to separate which type of content you will be encountering more. Most of the MoH content that will be in game will have varying levels of exclusive content so its a good intro to that.


Demonic Citadel ends here.]
