after going to Half-Renovated Room while (Skarnoth is in Half-Renovated Room and Loyalty of Skarnoth > 4 and Nala is booked and "Unchained" is not listed in Traits of Skarnoth):

	say "     As you make your way through the library, you hear some cackling laughter coming from the direction of the half-renovated dining room. Deciding to check it out, you enter the large doors that lead into the dreary room. Once inside, you notice Skarnoth relaxing on his [']throne['], though in all honesty, it's nothing more than a simple comfy chair that he treats like one. What surprises you the most, however, is that the muscular demon isn't alone. You can't tell who exactly is with him, except that the individual is small and zipping through the air quickly, curving past Skarnoth in teasing approaches. Curiosity raised about what's going on, you attempt to keep yourself concealed while you listen in on their conversation, hoping to gain some insight into what is going on.";
	say "     You can of course tell which voice is Skarnoth; however, the other voice is quieter and clearly very feminine. 'So, what did you do that got you all tied up? I mean, with your looks and all of the chains, you really are coming across as some super slutty demon slave fantasy come to life!' A soft growl is his only response at first, but eventually, the demon prince composes himself enough to answer. 'Why don't you come a little closer, imp, and I will show you who the true demonic slut is.' A fit of giggles erupts throughout the room. 'Yeah, I think I'll pass. I'm not really in the mood to use a living dildo at the moment.' Judging by the sounds your slave is making, you are going to go out on a limb and say that Skarnoth doesn't appreciate being compared to a mindless sex toy.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Deciding that you have done enough snooping, you come out from where you were hiding and make your presence known. A lighting fast blur instantly rushes at you and wraps its small arms around one of yours. '[if Player is not defaultnamed][name of Player]! [end if]Were you looking for little ol['] me?' Glancing down, you are hardly surprised to see Nala hanging off of you. Without waiting for a response, the little purple imp just continues talking. 'So, is this big lug yours? Hehe, I didn't know you were into tying up helpless li'l demons! You're a kinky one, that's for sure.' Skarnoth is obviously tired of listening to what the imp has to say about him and begins to violently pull at the chain holding his collar. 'Helpless?! I am a prince of hell, you worthless little cocksleeve! I hold dominion over you, and I demand that you show proper respect to me!'";
	say "     Nala looks over at Skarnoth while he has his outburst, then rolls her eyes and turns her attention back to you. 'He's a noisy one, isn't he? I'm surprised that you haven't muzzled him by now. Then again, I guess that he does have a pretty mouth. Too bad all that comes out of it is that bile. What's his deal, anyways?' Glancing between the two demons, you can't help but feel a little surprised by Skarnoth's response. The usually cool and in control prince apparently has no tolerance for being mocked by other hellspawn. Focusing back on Nala, you begin to explain to her about how Skarnoth came into your possession. 'Wait... so Elijah was gonna kill him and then you stopped him, but the only way to do that was by enslaving a demonic prince?' The purple imp lets out a snort of laughter. 'Wow, you sure know how to live a complicated life, don't you? Aren't you worried that our little mister pure of heart might just... I don't know, come in here and decide to go all stabby-stabby when you're not around?'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You are about to defend Elijah when you hear a squeal come from Nala. 'I know exactly what to do!' The little imp ends up flying alongside a slightly pouty Skarnoth. Apparently, he doesn't much care for being ignored. 'I learned this trick from this chick I met named Lilith. She was kind of a manipulative bitch, but damn did she have a great pair of tits.' For a moment, Nala's eyes glaze over, almost like she is lost in a memory. You snap your fingers in front of her face to capture her attention and ask her what she's going on about.";
	say "     Shaking her head Nala comes back to the conversation. 'Well you see, Lilith has a thing for slaves as well. I mean, she usually just takes over their mind and like completely breaks their will, but for some, she actually seems to enjoy the struggle. That's where I learned how to use these nifty li'l glyphs!' Using one of her sharp claws, the imp pricks her own finger causing a small amount of blood to well up at the tip. With a whimsical motion, Nala quickly writes a small symbol on Skarnoth's collar and another on the side of his chair. After the imp finishes both of the symbols, they glow a bright-red before fading into black. You are about to ask her what was the point of all that, but before you get the chance, Nala simply unhooks the end of the chain from Skarnoth's collar and lets it drop.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You're eyes widen as the demon prince rises from his chair, a dark chuckle coming from his throat. 'That was a very stupid choice you just made, little imp.' Skarnoth begins to laugh and strut around the room enjoying his freedom, however Nala doesn't seem to be worried in the slightest. 'Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that the glyph I placed on his royal bitchiness locks him in this location.' This information definitely gives the demon prince pause. 'And how exactly are these symbols supposed to lock me in place?' Skarnoth's question is a good one, the threat posed by the hellspawn is too important to ignore. 'Well basically, you are going to have to return to the chair to [']recharge['] every couple of hours. The twist is that you can't move the chair. So yeah, you're locked down hehe.'";
	say "     While that bit of info is interesting, it doesn't exactly make you feel any safer. Apparently, your thoughts show on your face as Nala turns to you and explains further. 'You don't have to worry about prince creampuff here. See, the fun thing about dealing with demons is that they need people to survi-' With a loud roar, Skarnoth yells at the little purple imp for referring to him as a dessert. 'Hey, I just call [']em like I see [']em! Anyway as I was saying, so demons need people to survive. Like not just for kinky fun, but they also feed on actual life essence. That's why most demons don't stay in our reality for very long before returning to their own realm... well at least that's what Lilith told me anyway.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Nala ends up flying over to you and landing on your shoulder. 'You also shouldn't have to worry about him attempting to shatter anyone's mind here either, since apparently mortals without free will don't offer up enough nutrition.' You aren't sure if that's really meant to make you feel better or not, and then without any warning, Nala jumps off of your shoulder. 'So yeah, no murder or mindbreak! Well unless I was given bad info... nah I'm sure that the stuff is solid, but anyway, I gotta run!' The little imp makes a mimicry of attempting to run in midair, and with a peal of laughter, gives you one final boop on the nose before zipping out of the room.";
	say "     Your attention is pulled away from the door Nala flew out of by the tantrum that Skarnoth is having at the moment. Not sure on how exactly to deal with pissed off demonic royalty you simply watch him for a bit. The muscular hellspawn starts to stomp loudly as he walks back and forth in a line, grumbling the whole time about vengeance. Oddly enough, your name is never mentioned on the list of people that deserve punishment, however Elijah, Nala, and even Lilith are threatened for their involvement in his imprisonment. You decide that it would be best to allow the infuriated demon to calm down a bit. At least he can move around now, rather than being strapped down to that chair. Hopefully, he will attempt to focus on the positives rather than just the negatives.";

'Then there was this one time that my army attacked another hell realm. Of course we won, but the best part was when it came to the spoils! My imps brought in these two captives from the enemy, a guy and a girl who apparently were the prince and princess of their realm. They both had some choice words for me, ya'know the usual [']You will never get away with this!['] mixed with a little [']You will be destroyed by our forces, a disgusting thing like you has no chance of victory![']. Well, with one look, I knew exactly what needed to be done! So I grabbed the girl and slammed her down on my cock mid-sentence, her eyes looked like they were gonna bulge out of her skull, haha!";
	say "     Then again, I guess it's not everyday that you lose your virginity to a Master of Hell, so maybe I shoulda cut her some slack, but her words were still fresh in my mind. So I pounded her pussy right there in front of her brother, and you should have seen the look on that boys face, a perfect mixture of shock, disgust, and arousal. Pretty soon, her screams turned into nonstop moaning, and I shot my load right into that little condescending bitch haha! Being the nice ruler that I am though, I wasn't about to let her brother feel left out, so while she was passed out, I bent him over my throne. Damn, that slut was a squealer! By the end of the day, I had both of them worshiping my cock like they were born for it.'";

Slowly, you take a seat in his chair and make yourself comfortable as a few snickers come from the spectators.

As he forces his anger down and calms his expression, the magic of the collar fades from sight once more, leaving behind nothing more than a somewhat reddened band around his neck and the faint smell of burned flesh. Sullenly, the demon steps up to stand before you, his head bent as he says, 'Alright, [italic type][master][roman type], what do you want?'

You decide to attempt to calm the demon down after his outburst with a few soft kisses along his throat before traveling down to his chest. Sliding out of the chair and placing yourself between Skarnoth's spread legs, you resume your assault on his chest. Allowing your tongue to gently scrape along the demon's nipple, you hear a sharp intake of breath from above you. 'I didn't ask for a goddamned bath, bitch.

The scent of his maleness is intoxicating, and you can't help but feel your arousal growing as you take in his aroma mixed with the act of submitting to such an impressive male. Eventually, all of your attention is too much for his dick to handle, and it pops out of the top of his thong. You can make out the precum already starting to bead up at the tip of his cock just waiting to be tasted. Lifting his muscular bubble butt off of the chair for a moment, Skarnoth pulls his thong down lower. 'I don't need you damaging my things while attempting to get at my dick, slut. Now get on with it. All of these nice people are waiting for a show!'";

With that, his clawed hands grab ahold of the back of your head, pushing you down further at a very fast pace as he continues to try and ram the crown of his cock down your throat without giving you a chance to adjust to his size.

You start to pull off of his dick a bit in an attempt to make yourself more comfortable. Well that was your plan, until you start to feel something slithering around your neck. Skarnoth's tail wraps itself snugly around your throat, and you feel it tightening as it begins to move you up and down. You quickly learn to take a breath when you can as the demon prince uses his tail to essentially force you to skull fuck yourself.

You have no doubt that Skarnoth would stay true to his word, so you quickly begin to swallow as fast as you can to keep up with the torrent that he is shooting.

Laughing at the wide-eyed expression that your little show draws from most of the watchers, you praise your subby slave and ready yourself for one final smack on his hole.

Waving to the others and telling them that the show is over for now, you wait for the crowd to disperse, then lightly tap Skarnoth's ass and tell him to get up. 'Yes, [master]. I should get back to my place, shouldn't I?' he replies in a newly submissive tone that you reward with a smile. Before he can leave though, you inform him to clean up the mess he made on your leg.

Raising an eyebrow at Skarnoth's flirty tone, you decide to try and one up the demon and inform him that whatever tricks he has to offer you are more than capable of handling them.

You're surprised by the slight crack forming where you just landed your hit, without turning to face the demon you ask him what, if any is the main rule that beings from hell live by. 'That's easy, I mean our world isn't the most... habitable, so we follow the creed of might makes right.' Finally turning to face the hellspawn you can see the pride on his face, more than likely due to the fact that as he was the previous master of hell, he viewed himself as the most powerful of his species. Opening your mouth to speak, you follow up your question with another and ask him what that makes you as the one that bested him. The look on his face shifts from his normally cocky appearance to something more akin to shame, 'That's what makes you my [master]...'";
	say "     The heaviness of the discussion finally hits you, and you find yourself wanting to have the fun back from a few moments ago. Shaking your head to clear it a bit, you smile at the demon and tell him that yeah you're his [master] now, but that doesn't mean he can't still be a badass. The puzzled expression on Skarnoth's face could be described as cute, almost like a puppy trying to figure out how to get a treat out of a box bigger than itself. The entire room is still filled with your glowing blue smoke, the fog wrapping around the two of you like a blanket. '[Master] I don't kn-' You cut the hellspawn off by swinging your fist backwards, nowhere near his face, but close enough to get his attention. 'What the fuck?! Alright I definitely don't think the nykrata should be smoked by humans now!' He's still not getting it, with a touch of cockiness of your own, you tell to him that yes he's right you're the [master] here.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'So what, having a slave isn't good enough? Now you want a punching bag as well?' The look of hurt on his face pulls at some strings inside you, but as the [master] you have to think of the big picture. Continuing where you left off, you follow up by explaining to him that you have no need for a punching a bag, but even if he's your slave, there is no reason for him not to be the second scariest thing in this city. Adjusting to a fighting stance you tell him to bring it, 'So you want me to beat you in a fight?' With a smirk on your lips, you tell him that you'd like to see him try. Where your stance is a more opportunistic one born from your time in the city, Skarnoth's is one built for raw power. As the two of you exchange blows, you are quickly reminded of your last fight with the former master of hell and comment on his lack of evolution in combat. 'Why fix what's not broken!' The smile on his face at this small show of carnage lets you know that you made the right choice.";
	say "     As his fists start to rain down on you, they are easy to dodge by simply jumping backwards and you joke that his reach is severely lacking, this rewards you with what you were hoping for and a taloned foot cuts the air right in front of you. While the hit still doesn't connect, you can feel the demon's annoyance grows at missing his target. While he's certainly keeping you moving, he's also tiring himself out by putting so much force into each individual hit. Commenting on the fact that he's overexerting himself for reach, you ask the demon if he has any other part of his body that could match the distance with a fraction of the effort. Skarnoth stops moving for a moment and his eyes scan your little field of battle for any type of opening. Deciding that a little push might help, you ask him if his huge ass is just to let everyone around him know that he's a true bottom slut.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The fire that erupts in his eyes is exactly what you'd expected and almost on instinct the demon whirls around using his thick and massive tail to finally land his first real hit. The impact is enough to send you flying across the room and colliding with one of the walls, while you know you should writhing be in pain... for some reason you don't feel any. 'How's that for a true bottom slut!' Getting up from the floor, you joke that it could be useful having an ass that can bite back. The two of you burst into laughter at your lame joke, the effects of nykrata and the adrenaline from the fight still flooding both of your systems. Without warning the behemoth of a man rushes you and slams your body into the air, however with one well placed landing step you flip your positions. Landing on top of Skarnoth, you look down seeing that due to the force of the rush he knocked the wind out of himself and with a smirk on your lips you explain to him how helpless he looks now.";
	say "     While his pained face is looking up at you with rage you continue to mock him, about how if this were out in the city he would already be being used as a cocksleeve or dildo, something to be used and then thrown away. If looks could kill you would definitely be history at this point, the demon raises a single clawed fist to swipe at you, but you easily restrain him. You can see that Skarnoth's fury is starting to fade and a sense of acceptance for his fate is washing over him... that just won't do. Leaning forward, you whisper into the hellspawn's ear that the [']normal['] means of combat that he relies on are out and unless he has any [']tricks['] up his sleeve, he will always be the bottom bitch. Seeing the flames in his eyes light up again, you aren't surprised when he quickly pulls his hand out of your grasp, but rather than taking another swipe, he grabs one of his own nipples and twists... hard. A plume of flames erupt from within his throat and if you hadn't anticipated this very attack, well rather than just getting another face full of soot you probably would have just lost your head.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The look of arrogance on his face is short lived as you begin to laugh, 'Hey what's so funny?! I could have just destroyed you!' With a wink you explain to him that he's right, funny how evolution can make all the difference. 'Wait... you mean you weren't just making fun of me? Goddammit!' The look of complete defeat on his features doesn't really fit with what you planned for this little sparring match. 'So I guess I was meant to be a slave huh? Weak, pathetic... a joke.' Wanting to shut down this trail of thought right away, you tell him that yeah you would have won, but by learning new ways to fight he was able to give you a run for your money and those are skills he will be able to use in the future to defend himself. Proof that sometimes it's best to think outside the box after all. 'Money? Wait we were betting on that match? Uhhh, you know I don't have money right?' Rolling your eyes, you explain it's just a figure of speech.";
	say "     Over the next hour the sparring continues with you mentioning pointers on how Skarnoth can become a more effective fighter. Surprising the demon takes the rest of your comments to heart, even going so far as attempting to throw you off balance with his own fighting creations. Eventually Skarnoth drops his fighting stance for a moment and looks you dead in the eyes, '[Master], I will become stronger... and when I do, I will beat you and earn my freedom.' The words aren't a threat, they are simply a fact as far as the hellspawn is concerned. Your own reply is in the same tone and you tell him if he's able to beat you one day he will have earned his freedom, but you don't plan on making it easy. Without skipping a beat, the two of you get back into your fighting stances to resume your sparring.";

You want to argue, but either due to the nykrata or simply just some part locked away deep down inside of you, you just can't. The harsh grip on your arms finally begins to soften as the demon gently places your hands on his abs, you can feel the hard lines of muscle flex and tighten under your fingertips, 'Worship and learning can be two sides of the same coin, you don't have to choose.'

Once you learn to properly give into your instincts that's when you can finally find paradise.' The two of you finally begin to relax, while you're still alternating from rubbing against the hellspawn's body and licking him, a moment of realization passes over the both of you and the feeling of change that has surrounded the dynamic that you share...";

A plume of flames erupt from within his throat and if you hadn't anticipated this very attack, well rather than just getting another face full of soot you probably would have just lost your head.

Wanting to shut down this trail of thought right away, you tell him that yeah you would have won, but by learning new ways to fight he was able to give you a run for your money and those are skills he will be able to use in the future to defend himself.

A silence hangs in the air between you both, in your mind though you try to figure out what he could mean by [']breeding papers[']. Finally you break the silence and ask him if they were supposed to be about him knocking someone up, or if it's something different.

You never really thought of Skarnoth having brothers or sisters and ask him why he never mentioned it before. 'There isn't really a point in talking about the dead now is there.' Everything goes quite for a bit, you aren't really sure what to say, part of you wants to know what happened, but another part of you doesn't really wanna know. 'My mother and father... or well I guess my older brother and sister would be a better term to use, they would go over the potentials and decide which ones were worthy.' Without thinking you ask him what were they supposed to be worthy of, ruling? 'If they were worthy of life. See, all demons are born in different ways. Some are born from tainted souls and others like my bloodline are born from the very essence of hell itself in these little pod like sacks.'";
	say "     Looking over at Skarnoth, you can see the cracks starting to show through his cocky mask. Wanting to see a smile return to his face if only for a moment, you comment on how you bet he was adorable when he was little. 'Haha, I wouldn't know, I mean they didn't think so. As soon as I was born I was placed inside a cloister of torment, only the strongest have the right to live ya'know? And that I did, I lived through everything they threw at me. Always coming out stronger, more resilient... more sadistic, just like they wanted.' Getting up, you aren't sure if it's the right choice or not, but you take a seat right next to the demon, showing that at this very moment he wasn't alone. 'Then when I was about, I don't know ten or so, they allowed another to be born. He wasn't placed in the cloister like I had been, not gonna lie, I despised him for that. I wanted him to hurt like I had, I wanted him to I don't know, be able to understand what I had survived.'";

I stalked him in the palace one night and waited till he was all alone, then I made my move. I attacked him and beat him repeatedly, the whole time he cried and begged me to stop, jeez he was always such a crybaby... but I didn't. At least until something that he said finally filtered through my mind, he called me his brother and said that he loved me. A feeling overtook me that I wasn't used to, I mean demons aren't supposed feel things like love right?' While not wanting to interrupt what Skarnoth is telling you, you can't help but mutter that anything can feel love. The demon still looks a bit broken, but nods his head in agreement. 'Everything changed for me that day, as I looked down him, he was bleeding and bruised, but rather than looking at me with hatred there was something else there. I decided then and there that he was something precious... something I had to protect.'";
	say "     Skarnoth goes silent for a bit and you allow him to take his time in telling you want he needs to. 'I couldn't let anyone know how I felt besides him, caring about something was just another weakness and would exploited by our caretakers. But I used to secretly bring him little presents, I quickly learned that bringing him trophies from my hunts was not the way to go though. You should have seen the look on his face when he saw me show up in his room in the middle of the night with a kill, covered in blood and yeah lets just say that was the first time I actually understood the term [']projectile['] vomit, haha!' Talking about his brother, a calm seems to fall over Skarnoth and a real smile finally forms on his lips. 'Eventually, I figured out he liked soft things. I would bring small beasts to play with and... all the different colored nykrata I could find, he loved to weave them into little wreaths. I can't even imagine the look on my face when he placed one on my head and dubbed me [']Prince Skarnoth['].'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Your mind goes to the nykrata you smoked with Skarnoth earlier and you can't help but wonder if it was actually something he had on his person to bring back for his brother. 'A few days after that, I had to leave the palace. A war had broken out on the outskirts, an uprising and it was decided that I was needed on the frontlines. Nothing seemed different or out of place, but after I had been on the battlefield for a few weeks, my spymaster approached me and informed me of some... problems back at the palace. She was a bitch, but damn if she wasn't good at her job, haha. Most would say that I had a moment of weakness, but I didn't care I rushed back home. See the fact is my brother was far weaker than me physically... but he was able to manipulate energy like no other, unfortunately he was also an incredibly beautiful creature.' You don't really like where this is going, but you decide that if the truth is going to be presented the least you can do is keep listening. 'My spymaster informed of a ritual that was in place, it would allow our... caretakers to absorb his energy.";
	say "     This would make them young and powerful again, and it would shatter his mind in the process, leaving them with a compliant toy. As I broke through the palace doors I could see the ritual had already begun, my brother was crying begging them to stop, but they were just laughing at his pain and I snapped. I don't really remember what happened after that, I just know that I killed them both and I saved my little brother, and to be honest that was enough for me. That's also how I became the master of hell, by taking their lives, I rose up. The funny thing is, even though I was the badass that had come to his rescue, the first thing he did was run up and start to check me for wounds. When he realized that I was fine, he just wrapped his arms around me and started sobbing about how we were finally free.' The story leaves an odd feeling in the pit of your stomach that only gets worse when your eyes land on the collar around his throat, the same one that makes you his [master]. 'Hey, demon remember? I will live thousands of years after you croak, so this is only temporary, haha.";

	say "     Besides you beat me and because that, when I do claim my freedom back I fully intend on taking you back with me as my own personal slave.' The wink he sends your way is playful rather than potentially terrifying like his words. You give the demon a light punch in the shoulder and thank him for telling you his story, 'I felt it was time, besides you kinda walked in on me destroying the last remnants of pain that I had in past, so yeah, haha' Finally at the doorway, you stop and turn around. You aren't sure if it's the right thing to ask or not, but you decide to go for broke and ask Skarnoth what his brother's name is. The demon stops cleaning up his area and you in the eyes with a playful smile spreading across his lips, 'His name is Aernarus and because you seem so curious, yeah I think he'd like ya' With a smile all your own, you make your way back out into the city, wondering if one day you might meet this Aernarus.";

Slowly walking up to the demon as to not awaken just yet, you notice that the hellspawn must be having a [']very['] happy dream, well if the massive erection is anything to go by. Slowly reaching over with a smirk on your face, you touch his thick demon dick and enjoy the way that the slight amount of friction causes it to pulsate. Applying a bit more pressure causes Skarnoth to moan out in his sleep, oddly enough the word that he moaned out was your name. Leaning in close to his ear, you ask the demon what does he want you to do? 'Mmm I want you to use, I want to please you!' You smile at how much Skarnoth has grown from the... acquired taste that he used to be. 'You freed me [master].' That last comment catches you off guard and you remove your hand from the hellspawns morning wood.";
	say "     Apparently that was enough to rouse Skarnoth from his slumber and the demon looks at you with bleary eyes, a soft smile on his lips. '[Master], what are you doing here?' More than likely looking similar to a dear in the headlights, you quickly comment on the fact that you just came to check up on him. What was before a small smile instead turns into a huge grin as you are tackled by the large former prince, 'Aww [master], you're so good to me!' Well this isn't exactly how you imagined your day going that's for sure. 'So [master] what do you wanna do now that you're here?' The flirty tone in the hellspawn's voice gives you a few ideas of what exactly he would like to do, you are still a bit off put by his earlier comment of you freeing him and instead say that you would just like to relax and chill a bit.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     For a moment a sad expression falls over Skarnoth's face, but it's swiftly replaced with a content one, 'Alright, that seems a bit boring, but if that's what you want then I live to serve, haha!' The two of you both sit down and just sit there taking in the atmosphere, but eventually you look over at Skarnoth, you're surprised to see the demon's eyes closed and his body moving rhythmically from side to side. You watch him like that for a few moments, taking in the fact of how incredibly handsome the hellspawn actually is and how at the moment he actually looks like he doesn't have a care in the world. While part of you wants to just watch him for a few more minutes, another part of you sees this as an opportunity to learn more about the fallen prince. Opening your mouth you decide to ask Skarnoth if he's a big fan of music, your question obviously startling the demon. 'Oh umm... well I guess I do. I know that it's not very becoming of a leader, but you're my master now so I don't really have to worry about it anymore, do I?'";
	say "     A forced smile forms on your lips as you nod your head in agreement, the thought of his freedom still on your mind, but now he has you curious and you choose to ask if his interest in music is purely a new experience thing? The fallen prince's face takes on a soft pink color as he's obviously embarrassed by your question, either because he's never been asked, or simply for a reason that you don't know quite yet. 'Well, I mean it's not exactly a new thing. When I was younger I would sometimes indulge myself in private.' The worried look on Skarnoth's brows doesn't sit well with you, so with a single snap of your fingers you call the demon closer. Raising up, the hellspawn crawls towards you on all fours, his massive muscles rippling as he gets closer to you. Once he's within reach, you extend one of your hands and grasp one of the adonis's horns, pulling him flush with your body. While at first his body is rigid, more than likely not knowing what exactly you have planned, he slowly begins to relax though as you allow your fingertips to caress up and down his back.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Feeling his warm body pressed so close to your own, you ask him to tell you a bit more about his youth, 'You mean like with the music stuff?' You simply tell him that he can talk about anything that he wants to. Although since he did just mention music, maybe that would be a good place to start. Skarnoth is still for a moment before he finally decides to speak, 'I guess I was always attracted to music, especially the beats. Believe it or not hell has it's own music industry... well it's more of something people do in the streets than a career thing like on earth. Sometimes I would listen to the sounds in the streets below from my bedroom, at first I saw it as nothing more than annoying noise, but eventually I started to realize that music is actually a... I don't know, physical manifestation of emotions.' The demon goes silent again as a slow but steady purr begins in the back of his throat at your continued caresses.";
	say "     Wanting to get him back on topic, you stop your ministrations and instead just lay your hand on his soft skin, 'Hey, why did you stop that? I liked it.' Jokingly, you comment on the fact that you realized that, but you want him to continue. However if he's a good boy, then he may get more later. You don't even need to see his face to just know that your comment is being met with rolled eyes, 'Uhg... fine. So like the first time that I realized the connection that I had with music was when I was pissed off about... something. I was wanting to destroy something, anything, but instead I just sat there. I had been trained to never let emotions play a role in my life, but on that day I heard those screeching melodies and eventually they started to sink below the surface. It reminded me of the battlefield and those notes were like blades slicing me open. Past the flesh, fat and bone, to my very core. And well, I blew up... by the end of that day my quarters were completely decimated, heh.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You comment on the fact that the demon is making it sound like music was just a destructive force for himself, 'Well in that situation it was, but there was more to it. It was a sense of liberation, for the first time I knew what freedom tasted like and I would secretly indulge myself when no one else was around.' With a bit of a laugh in your voice, you joke about not really thinking of him as a rocker boy before now, 'Ah you mean genre stuff? Well I mean I listened to other stuff too, it just depended on my mood really.' The hellspawn actually snuggles up closer to your body, 'I would also rely on music when I wanted to feel sexy ya'know, I could show you what I mean if you like?' A smile forms on your lips and you comment on the fact that you would like to see that. Skarnoth pulls back and looks at you with a wicked glint in his eyes.";
	say "     Siding himself over your waist to straddle you, Skarnoth closes his eyes again and begins to slowly gyrate to beat that only he can hear. You place both of your hands on his meaty waist, enjoying the feeling of his flesh and he continues to give you a small lap dance. While you are definitely enjoying what's taking place, you can't help but wish that you could hear the beat in the hellspawn's mind, feeling that it would make the dance be even more effective. Apparently something may have clued Skarnoth into the fact that something was not right as he stops his movements, 'Everything alright [master]? You don't seem to be having as much fun as I'd hoped you would.' Wanting the sad expression removed from the handsome demon's face, you comment on the fact that what he was doing was very nice, you just wish there was some music in the background to hear that's all.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The demon seems to think on this for a few moments, before a fanged smiled spreads over his lips, 'I know! I could just ask my personal servants to play something for us!' Well... that comment was the last thing you expected to hear. While you're about to comment on the fact that the demon doesn't have any servants anymore, Skarnoth instead proceeds to lean further back and a bright light forms over his chest. You can hear the demon mumble some words under his breath that you can't quite make out, but then the light grows even brighter and with a final blinding explosion you see a few imps floating in between the two of you facing the former prince. Your mouth drops open and you're left gaping a bit like a fish at this turn of events. Looking at the four small beings, one appears to be a portly middle-aged imp in fancy attire, almost looking like a little butler. The other three though seem to be much younger and their attire is... well nothing more than simple low-hanging loincloths, but other than that you can't really see a difference between them. The older imp is the first to speak up, 'Master is there something that you required of us?' However, before Skarnoth can actually answer one of the three smaller imps quickly interjects with, 'Yeah, I thought you wanted us to stay hidden until the right moment, that way we could disembowel that mortal?!'";
	say "     You raise an eyebrow at Skarnoth who now looks completely embarrassed, 'Heh, umm yeah that kinda was the plan, but I've decided to stay with the mortal as his slave, so that plans a bust!' It's at that moment that the little imps finally realize that you're right behind them... well under them to be precise and quickly flutter over and behind the much larger demon. Right now you have so many questions it's not funny, but the fallen prince acts as if having a plot to kill you wasn't that big of a deal. Seeing the look of anger on your face, Skarnoth quickly cuddles up to you, '[Master] that was before I realized that I wanted to be by your side and saw just how great you are!' Still mildly confused and annoyed, you decide to comment on the imps that he just... you don't even know, gave birth to? Your comment causing the demon to snort in laughter, 'I didn't give birth to them, Haha! Alright maybe some introduction are needed here. Sephtis come here.' The middle aged imp quickly flies over and lands on Skarnoth's open hand, 'This is Sephtis, he was my first servant that I managed to capture when I was a kid.' Not knowing what else to do, you just utter a slightly uncomfortable 'Nice to meet ya.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The older imp offers up flourishing bow in response, 'It is a pleasure to meet the new [master] of both the previous master and of ourselves!' Skarnoth looks a bit confused at first but then realization flashes over his features, 'Oh yeah, I guess technically they now belong to you don't they, since I do as well, haha!' Without skipping a beat, the former prince then continues, 'So as I was saying, I captured Sephtis and instead of deciding to just throw him into the pleasure pits as fuck meat, I decided to keep him as a servant. Then over time I decided that I wanted more, so I worked out a contract with a local breeder. That didn't work out as well as I had hoped though, see I was thinking I would just get a single cute little imp, but instead ol['] Sephtis here turned out to be like hyper virile and knocked that bitch up with a set of headache inducing triplets.' The older imp quickly interjects with, 'I'm still very sorry about that young master.'";
	say "     Skarnoth just laughs and waves it off, 'It's alright, I mean it was your first time after all, besides I knew the challenges that I would have to go through when I decided to not shatter your mind.' The calm smile between the two of them makes you a bit uncomfortable, as if they were discussing a fond memory rather than talking about breaking a creatures mind. The fallen prince's attention is brought back to you and he continues, 'So yeah, he knocked her up with Tano, Tino, and Talo.' The smaller imps fly over, one simply waves, another just gives a nod of his head with a wicked smile on his face, and the last one just flicks you off while looking bored. While the little creature that waved seems a bit curious about you, the other two however seem to act as if you're nothing new. Once again your mind going back to when you first started hunting Skarnoth and the two imps that you had to fight on your way to find him. You just send an uneasy smile their way, and not knowing what else to say you just ask Skarnoth if these are supposed to be his sex slaves or something?";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     This causes all of the demons in the room to crack up, 'Of course not [master]! I mean certain beings just aren't supposed to mix, I mean by human standards they would prolly be considered more like... pets ya'know? Sephtis here has only bred someone once! And the triplets... well I did consider getting them breeding contracts, but the breeder I was going to use didn't like the fact that they still had their minds, so she backed out.' The triplet that had simply smiled at you was swift to interject, 'Well that was a good thing for them, cuz I would have totally destroyed that bitch's imp, haha!' Skarnoth simply rolls his eyes, 'Spoken like a true virgin-boy Talo.' The imps brothers are quick to laugh at the fallen prince's comment, while the imp that you now know to be Talo just flutters there and pouts. This is all a lot to take in at once and decide to bring the conversation back to the original reason that the large demon summoned them, commenting on if the imps can actually play any music.";
	say "     The whole room goes silent for a bit, that is before Skarnoth addresses the older imp, 'Sephtis, I need you and the boys to do that stuff I had you all practice in private got it?' The older imp looks a bit nervous at first, 'Young master, I thought that was only meant to be used when no one else but us was around?' Skarnoth looks a bit annoyed at the comment, 'Number one, we are in the mortal world now so we can do whatever we want. Number two, stop calling me master, you belong to my [master] now!' All four of the imps simply nod their heads and go over to the table. Instantly odd little instruments appear before them and they each take their places and begins to play. The former prince allows his head to bop to the beat a bit before turning back to look at you, 'There we go [master], now you have a beat to follow while I dance for you!' Once the beat starts harden, you can immediately feel the sexual undertones. Skarnoth slowly start to slide his hands up his own torso, tweaking his own nipples as he goes.";

With a smile on your face, you give one of Skarnoth's juicy ass cheeks a slap.

Shockingly, the little imps attempt to avoid looking at the meaty ass that you've just exposed, instead focusing on continuing to play their music. Not wanting to be left with egg on your face, you pull your arm back and slam your palm against one of the large hellspawn's jiggly buttocks. The loud noise causes the imps to quickly look over and a smile forms on your lips at the range of expressions on their faces, from fear to desire. Maybe once the imps have been in the mortal world a bit longer they will become more open to new experiences and a little less held back in their past training in hell. Once the beat starts up again, you are quick to comment on the fact that you're still waiting for that dance.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     At first nothing happens and you're about to give Skarnoth's butt another spanking to get him moving, but as the bass finally hits the demon's hips finally begin to undulate. As the former prince finally rights himself up to get better leverage, you notice that his eyes are closed. The demon seems to be focusing purely on the beat, and while normally you would want his attention completely on yourself, you can't help but be curious on what he will do next. A small smirk on his mouth is the only warning you are given as he begins to speed up his gyration. The demon's molten eyes finally open and meet your own, a bit of mirth in them at seeing that you're enjoying his efforts. While still riding you, Skarnoth opens his mouth to speak, '[Master] I know that for whatever reason, you're still going to be going out into the rest of the city...' A look of conflict passes over his normally seductive features.";
	say "     Feeling generous, you ask the demon what's on his mind, 'Well, I was thinking about how boring it is in this run down old building, and how it might be fun to go out with you into the city!' Chuckling a bit, you bring up the fact that you are usually gone for awhile and how he requires his [']battery throne['], 'That's true, but we could also connect you to the chair, spiritually of course! Not like a weird chair person hybrid... although now that I'm thinking about it, I wonder if their are any of those in this city, haha!' Wanting to get Skarnoth back on track, you ask him what exactly that would entail, 'Well normally my throne pours spiritual energy into me that it absorbs from the area, this would basically make it so that you can absorb the same energy. That way I could go out with you and still get powered up, well as long as I stay really close to you!'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Feeling a bit playful, you comment on the fact that it seems like that would only be to his benefit, what exactly would you get out of this arrangement? 'Well, being able to absorb spiritual energy would effect your body a bit. Ya'know make you stronger, faster, that whole thing. But I would also be able to help you fight on the frontlines!' The hellspawn seems excited by this idea, but as his [master] you have to at the very least pretend to mull it over. When you don't agree him right away his face drops a little bit and his rhythmic grinding stops as well, 'I mean I understand if you don't think that I'd be much help, I just thought that it would be something fun that we could do together.' Not being able to hold it back anymore, you finally burst out in laughter and explain to Skarnoth that you think this could actually be one of his best ideas!'";
	say "     'Really?!' The look of happiness on his face actually wins you over completely to trying this out and you nod your head in agreement. 'That's great! All you have to do is form a pact with me, kinda like what I did with the imps.' You ask how exactly you're supposed to form this pact and Skarnoth eyes light up, 'Just tell me what I am and them lay your claim!' Smiling, you tell the demon that he's yours and pull him down by one of his horns and claim his lips. Your whole body feels like it's being engulfed in fire at first, but eventually it begins to die down and you are left with a feeling of warmth in your chest. Skarnoth quickly rises off of you in excitement, 'It worked! Alright so where should we go!? Should we go beat someone up?! Ooo or maybe try and take on some major league demon?!' You roll your eyes at the hellspawn's antics, but one thing is for sure, this will definitely be an adventure.";

Part 1 - Dom Skarnoth

after going to Half-Renovated Room while (Skarnoth is booked and SkarnothMasterSlave < -1 and "Unchained" is listed in Traits of Skarnoth):
	say "     Walking into the half-renovated room, you can instantly feel something different in the air, something that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. Looking over towards where Skarnoth's chair in located and find the former master of hell sitting there[if SkarnothThongStatus is 1] naked as sin [else] naked as sin with his black thong wrapped in one hand[end if], his hard cock throbbing intensely. Raising your eyes to meet his gaze, you are surprised to the normally dark-red eyes have changed to a brighter shade of red, the new color mixed with his natural skin tone creating an illusion of blood across a sunset sky. A smile spreads across the demon's lips, showcasing just a hint of his fangs and slowly he raises his hand and with a singe finger beckons you closer.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     [bold type]Should you approach Skarnoth in his current state?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yes, you can't help but feel a compulsion to follow his request.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - No, this is all wrong, you need to get out of here.";
	if Player consents:
		say "     Once you take that first shaky step, you begin to feel more confident in your choice and your steps become steadier. Stopping just in front of the horned demon you begin to feel a bit uneasy, he hasn't said anything and is just simply watching you at this point. It seems that this was just another one of Skarnoth's mind games and you turn to leave, 'Take another step and it will be your last.' Turning your head back to look at the hellspawn, you are surprised to see him with that same calm yet amused look on his face. Opening your mouth to comment on his threat, you are quickly silenced by one of his clawed digits as it presses firmly against your lips. 'There's really no need for you to talk is there [master]? Besides, I think that it's high time you listened to someone else... someone that's clearly your superior, don't you agree? Now... strip.'";
		say "     You are caught off guard by both what Skarnoth just said to you and the fact that he attempted to give [']you['] an order. A mischievous thought enters your mind and you take a step backwards, your eyes never leaving the demons. With a wicked smile of your own, you prepare to put on a show to have the hellspawn remember who exactly is in charge here.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		if player is male: [flat pecs]
			say "     Slowly, you allow your hands to caress over your pecs and begin to slide down your abs. As your palms rise up your chest again the hem of your top raises with it, exposing only the smallest hint of flesh underneath. Skarnoth's expression shows interest, however his posture shows a certain level of boredom, 'Well [master], that's a very... cute little dance you're doing there, but perhaps I should just go out and find someone else that has the necessary [']skills['] to entertain me.' Skarnoth's words instantly get under your skin and you redouble your efforts, although you can't help the feeling in the back of your mind that something here is off. Grabbing the hem of your top, you quickly pull the garment over your head, the slight chill in the air causing your nipples to harden.";
			say "     With a smile on your lips you toss the fabric straight at the demon, but right before it's about to smack him in the face he sends it flying in another direction with a single finger, his only comment on your actions is a single raised eyebrow.";

Your surprise must be evident by the deep chuckle that reverberates through the hellspawn's chest, 'You look a little shocked by my actions, but is it so strange for a slave to want to be closer to their master? You would never deny me that would you?' You aren't able to poke any holes in his logic and slowly begin to nod your head in agreement, but you're stopped by a hand wrapping around the side of your throat with lightning speed, 'You have a beautiful throat my pet, although... perhaps its fragility is what gives it its allure.' Out of the corner of your eye you can see the demon lean forward and then feel the wet tip of his tongue slowly rising along your artery feeling like a trail of liquid fire.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You can't help the shudder that runs through your body at the former master of hell's touch.";
	else:
		say "     Turning on your heel, you quickly make your way out of the room as fast as you can. Once you're back in the main part of the library you rest your back against a nearby wall and will your thumping heart to calm down, however at that same moment you hear an inhuman roar echo from the direction of the half-renovated room. Looking back at the doorway, you know that you made the right decision.";
