Section 1 - Location

Table of GameRoomIDs (continued)
Object	Name
Zephyr Storeroom	"Zephyr Storeroom"

West of Zephyr Lobby is Zephyr Storeroom.
Zephyr Storeroom is a room. Description of Zephyr Storeroom is "[zephyrstoreroom desc]".

to say zephyrstoreroom desc:
	say "     Entering the storeroom you can see boxes going all the way up to the ceiling. Along the walls in black paint someone has also done measurements, going by those, the room tops out at around twenty feet. The containers are grey and massive, obviously they must have a forklift stashed away somewhere in here as well. Color wise the room is a mixture of grey, white, and... off white, a very drab look to be sure. Off to the side in the back is a single desk with mountains of paperwork covering it, you can only assume that this mess belongs to Barret.";

Barrett	"Barrett"

Barrett is a man. He is in Zephyr Storeroom. The HP of Barrett is usually 0.
Description of Barrett is "[BarrettDesc]".
Conversation of Barrett is { "Arrg" }.

to say BarrettDesc:
	say "     Barret is a hispanic man that appears to be in his early to mid forties. He is around 6[']3 with a large build that at first glance could be confused as heavy set, however upon further inspection he appears incredibly muscular. His green eyes compliment his darker complexion giving him a slightly exotic look and his jet black hair is styled in a crew cut with a trimmed goatee to match. At the moment he is wearing a white tank top that shows off his massive arms and round belly, with a pair of black cargo pants that showcase his stockier legs and huge behind. A pair of silver dog tags hang from around his neck, in all honesty he looks more like a soldier or a mercenary than a guy that deals in stock taking.";

The scent of Barrett is "     Barret smells of clean sweat with a hint of cologne.".

Section 3 - Events

after going to Zephyr Storeroom while HP of Barrett is 0:
	if "Stealthy" is listed in feats of player:
		say "     Wanting to find out what is on the other side of the door, you watch Larissa, waiting for the receptionist to turn away and give you a chance to get inside. After a few minutes, a window of opportunity arises. Larissa appears to be completely consumed with some documents on the desk, and you decide to make use of this opening. Drawing from your nanite enhanced reflexes and embracing the inner ambush predator instincts that you have gained, you stealthily move towards the door with both speed and grace, like a shadow. Wrapping your hand around the handle, you quickly pull the door open and slide inside, softly tugging the door close before anyone can be the wiser. Gently placing your ear to the door, you listen intently for any sound that Larissa might have seen you, but you hear nothing but silence. Feeling a little more certain that you had made it in without being noticed, you turn around to take in your surroundings.";
		say "     It appears to be a warehouse of sorts, with huge crates and containers littering the floors and shelves. Truth be told, you were expecting some little shoddy office or something, not a two story room. Moving closer to one of the containers, you are about to lift the lid when you hear a booming voice come from off to the side. 'Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing in here?!' Quickly turning to face the direction the voice is coming from, you prepare yourself for a fight. The man before you is huge, and while he looks like a completely human hispanic man, he is still well over six feet tall. The first thing that you take in to gauge him is his age and build. He appears to be in his forties, and while at first he seems to be a heavyset man, you quickly think different as he gets ready for a fight as well, flexing a bit and cracking his knuckles.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The two of you begin to have a stare off, neither of you looking away from each other. His green eyes, while beautiful, have a fire in them, almost like this man was born to fight. Cracking his neck, the man eventually relaxes a bit. 'So, I take it you planned on sneaking in and running off with some stuff? Well that's not gonna be happening, and if you try, well, I will just pummel you into the ground, tie you up, and leave you outside for the natives to play with, capisce?' You nod your head in understanding and relax your own body. 'Now, the name's Barret, and this is one of the Zephyr storerooms, just in case you hadn't already figured that bit out. It's my job to move this shit around in here, but most of the stuff that makes its way inside is eventually thrown out, so I have a deal for you, if you're interested that is?' Instantly, you feel a bit wary of what kind of deal he wants to make, but ask him to make his offer anyway.";
		say "     'It's simple really, you can have anything in here you want, but your gonna pay me for it.' Opening your mouth to ask him why he is willing to do this, he quickly silences you. 'No questions asked. I ain't asking why you want this stuff, you ain't asking why I'm selling it.' You nod your head, letting the man know that you agree to his terms. 'Right, well I don't have a lot to offer right now, but that will change. Basically, the more shit they shove in here, the more you can get your mitts on.' Turning his back to you, Barret makes his way over to his desk. 'You just come see me when you want something, got it?' Well this little venture didn't go exactly how you planned, but at least it seems that you got something out of it. Maybe this place will have something you need.";
		now HP of Barrett is 1;
	else:
		say "     Wanting to find out what is on the other side of the door, you watch Larissa, waiting for the receptionist to turn away and give you a chance to get inside. After a few minutes, a window of opportunity arises. Larissa appears to be completely consumed with some documents on the desk, and you decide to make use of this opening. Trying to be as sneaky as possible, you edge closer to the door and reach out, taking the handle in your grip. 'What exactly do you think you're doing?' Turning your head quickly, you see Larissa looking at you with a single eyebrow raised. 'Can't you read what the door says? Employees only, and since you aren't to my knowledge working for Zephyr, that means you can't go in there.' Retracting your hand, you attempt to act as if you hadn't looked at the sign on the door. While the receptionist seems a bit annoyed, Larissa quickly goes back to work and paying you no mind. If you want to get in this door, you're going to have to find a way to become more [bold type]stealthy[roman type].";

Black Market ends here.
