Section 1- Orc Researcher

Orc Researcher is a situation.
The sarea of Orc Researcher is "Warehouse District".

Instead of resolving a Orc Researcher:
	say "     As you make your way around the buildings in the Warehouse District, you stop in front of a dilapidated building that more than likely wasn't doing very well long before the nanite incident began. You notice a flickering light in one of the rooms on the second floor. Wondering if it might be a potential survivor hiding out, or at the very least a place that might have some supplies, you start heading to the front door. Sadly, the front door is a crumbling mess, almost as if someone or something smashed their way in. You step back and glance around to look for another potential entrance. However, you wonder if you should even attempt to enter this building after seeing the state of the door.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     [bold type]Should you still attempt to find a way in?[roman type][line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Your gut tells you that something is here.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Something bad obviously happened here and should be avoided.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Despite the fact that something very... large and powerful came through here at some point, you don't let it deter you from your goal, and you cast a glance around to find another point of entry. Circling around to the side of the building you find a broken window. [if scalevalue of player <= 3]You easily just slip inside with no problems thanks to your small size. [else]With some difficulty you are able to get inside, shattering the window in the process. [end if]Looking around the room that you are in, you see that it is a disaster with broken furniture and shattered glass littering the floor, and come to the conclusion that this must have been a condemned apartment building, or at the very least it should have been. As you turn down the hallway outside of the main door, you are able to make out the stairwell leading up to the second floor.";
		say "     Keeping an ear out for any sounds that could mean a potential threat, you finally reach the top of stairs. Directly in front of you is a door with that same flickering light blinking underneath it. As you approach an aroma exudes from within the room. It smells ";
		if facename of player is "Orc Breeder" or facename of player is "Orc Warrior":
			say "sweet and makes your mouth begin to water. ";
		else:
			say "musky. Almost how a locker-room smells. ";
		say "You push the door open slowly, preparing yourself for an attack from either a survivor or what destroyed the entrance. Your eyes take in the room or what's left of it. Papers are scattered all over the floor, covered in what appears to be mathematical equations, along with what you assume to be many broken beakers. The room also has quite a few computers as well as other technical equipment, the computer monitors seemingly having been shattered by something very powerful throwing them around the room. Just judging from the state of the room you assume that a huge fight took place here.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Glancing down you see some strange marks left on the floor. Going for a closer inspection, you softly touch the lines, only then realizing they aren't simply marks, but scratches made by someone being dragged away against their will. You close your eyes, thinking what could have done this, at the same time, wondering how terrified this person must have been to leave gashes in the wooden floor. Walking up to what used to be a desk, before it was smashed down the middle, you check its drawers. Maybe there were some snacks hidden away inside or something. Sadly, the only thing that you find is a slender metal case that rattles a bit when picked up. Upon opening it your gaze is met with what must be between one-hundred to two-hundred small pills. Closing the case and setting it down, you notice that one of the computer monitors on the floor still is in working order. You lift it up and place it on a counter.";
		say "     Among all of the garbage on the floor, you find a working mouse, as long as you didn't need the right button which has been splintered off. Opening file after file, the only thing that really stands out is the fact that this person must have been a scientist of some sort and that they seemed very interested in the orc strain of the infection. Besides all of the files, there is a video clip. Double clicking it you are met with what must have been the poor guy that was dragged out of here, and he begins a rant about how if you are seeing this then he must be dead. Rolling your eyes, you get ready to abandon this venture. Opening the door again to leave, you catch part of what the guy is still saying in the video. 'I found the solution! I have discovered a way to extract what is needed from these freaks without having to become one!' Finally hearing something that may prove interesting you return to the monitor.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Listening to his manic laughter, you have a feeling that he lost it long before he was attacked, or maybe he always had a screw loose, who knows. 'I have been going out every day collecting samples from these green-skinned monsters, disgusting savages that they are. But all of my hard work has now paid off. I have found a way to steal the properties the nanites have activated within the infection strains' He continues on, basically repeating himself every so often. Finally, he appears to calm down, a fearful expression on his face.";
		say "     'I think they have been catching on though. Yesterday, I went out like normal but had to run back in when I noticed a few of them outside the building, just... standing there. That's why I'm making this video for the scientists that arrive after all of these beasts have been purged, so they know that I was the one! I was the first! The one that showed these creatures that they are inferior beings that can be used and thrown away like waste!' His manic laughter once again fills the room. 'I had found them exciting on an evolutionary level. The fact that these brutes are able to reproduce in a male only environment is extraordinary! That is the focus of my research: a way to replicate that ability, to keep homo sapiens superior in this conflict!' You can't help but feel that maybe he got what was coming to him, and after more raving, he finally gets to the point. 'I have manufactured pills by distilling the essence of the orcs, hidden inside of their ejaculate, to create pills that will grant anyone who takes them the same ability that the orcs possess except that they will remain pure and untainted.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "      You look back over at where you set the metal case of pills down, wondering exactly how he got a hold of his ingredients, as well as how effective they are. 'These pills and my research are going to be my legacy! As fellow scientists, you may posthumously revere me as the man who began a new world order! Like I said, they are going to make the name Liam Crescator famous world wide!' As he stands there cackling you can't help but be reminded of a villain rather than a man of science. Then again you doubt they are mutually exclusive either. Just as you are about to click stop on the video to finally silence the demented man, the video itself shakes as you now see that the scientist was right about the orcs being onto him, and you see him running around trying to keep away from the orc in the room, but at the same time, yelling at him to stay away from his research.";
		say "      The guy might have stood a chance if his priorities were straight, but he obviously placed his research over his own life. The video continues with the orc throwing one of the monitors above the human's head, missing him by a few inches, and all the while, the man continues his verbal assault, referring to the orc as a savage and brutish cretin. Apparently, the orc didn't really like being talked down to, if him punching the human square in the jaww and knocking him out cold is any indicator. Not knowing that he is technically on candid camera, the orc begins to remove the lab-coat and shirt from the previously belligerent man. When he finally gets down to the belt and starts to pull at it, unintentionally lifting the man up as well and accidentally dropping him on the floor hard.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "      The scientist groans at the crash and regains consciousness slowly. The orc, having grown tired of dealing with him, simply drags the man away by his foot, informing him, 'You will make a decent, if mouthy, breeder, and you will be very happy belonging to me. Just think, you will be gettin['] dicked every day. Doesn't that sound nice?' The man shouts and screams 'NO!' as he attempts to gain a purchase on the floor, but instead, just leaves the gouges in the wood that you saw earlier. With that, the video ends, and you can't figure out whether or not to feel bad for the scientist. While being a speciesist and a xenophobe he still deserved a choice in what you know inevitably happened to him. Going back over to the table where you set down the case of pills, you decide to grab them and hold on to them, since the case is so small it takes up almost no space. You decide that you have had enough of being in this room, not to mention the building.";
		say "      [if scalevalue of player <= 3]You walk quickly back downstairs to the window that served as your entryway into the building and hop out, landing softly on the cement outside. [else]Having destroyed the window that you used to get inside, you will need an alternative route out. Looking around the room, you notice that a window and decide that it's better than nothing, making your way over. It's a tight squeeze, but you make it through the window, though unfortunately not before destroying it just like the one downstairs. Huffing, you drop to the street below, causing your feet to sting for a moment after landing, but there is no serious damage done. [end if]Looking back at the building for the last time, you continue on your way. Hearing a strange sound in the distance, you look towards a crumbling wall in the direction of the noise. Only to see a pair of glowing eyes watching you in a calculating way, before their owner runs of.";

		increase score by 20;
	else:
		say "      Deciding against exploring the strange flickering light, you turn your back to the building and continue on your way. Hearing a strange sound in the distance, you look towards a crumbling wall in the direction of the noise. Only to see a pair of glowing eyes watching you with disappointment, before their owner runs of.";
	Now Orc Researcher is resolved;

Section 2 - Orc Pill Case

"orc pill case"	"You had found this slender metal case in a makeshift lab in the Warehouse District. Based on the research found with it, the pills inside were made by distilling the essence of orc cum into an untainted form. With the help of them, a male could impregnate another male without having to worry about being infected with the orc nanite strain."	0	orc pill case

orc pill case is a grab object.
the usedesc of orc pill use is "[OrcPillCaseUse]".

Wondering what this will do to you since you already have a womb in your ass, you begin to feel a tingle in your abdomen, and you wait for what comes next. After a minute or two of nothing, you wonder if the pill will even have any further effect on you. As you put the slender case back in your pocket and begin to go on about your business, you are hit with an overwhelming heat like a freight train. Growing light-headed and dizzy, you can't help but slump to the floor, your equilibrium completely shot. As you try to get your bearings, the whole world feels as if it's spinning around you. Regretting taking that pill, you attempt to wait out its effects, only to find that there are still more weird sensations to come. A shock wave of arousal floods through your body, making you seize up in a futile attempt to escape the burning lust growing from within you.";
		say "     Fear begins to creep into your mind by the fact that you can't move, nor focus, as this intense heat commences to cook your brain. A light buzzing sound builds within your cranium, then without warning your vision erupts in a bright light. As you lay on the ground, not being able to move or see, orgasm after orgasm ripples through your whole body, leaving you bathed in sweat and your own fluids. After the sixth consecutive climax overcomes your body within only a minute or two, you are left a sweaty, sticky, drooling mess - the very image of a slutty breeding bitch. Finally, your breathing begins to stabilize, and your eyesight starts to return. Unfortunately, you're still unable to move your body, and it takes a much longer amount of time to get control of your faculties.";

		say "     After a minute or two, you begin to rise on shaking legs, then stumble around to clean up your sticky clothes and get presentable again. Wiping the sweat off of your brow, you can't help but hold your head as the buzzing subsides. You definitely don't think that you should take any of those pills again. You almost lost your mind to the effects that it caused in your body. Still, you also can't deny the little voice in the back of your mind saying that you might just be happier as a virile males breeding bitch.";

Maybe the pills don't work after all? Then without any warning, your entire body heats up, causing you to drop to your knees with sweat beading your brow. It feels like your insides are moving around inside of your abdomen. Sweating profusely, you begin to tear your clothes off in an attempt to lesson the sweltering heat that you feel, all the while thinking that maybe just taking a strange pill that you found somewhere wasn't such a great idea. Throbbing muscle twitches begin to center on your back entrance, and you reach behind your back with trembling fingers.";
		say "     The first light touch of your opening leads to an immediate orgasm, with you flopping around like a beached fish, spilling your juices and whimpering in pleasure. Losing all ability of self-control, you jam your fingers inside of your asshole, pistoning them in and out to try and ride the high of unspeakable lust and heat that you are feeling. During one of the inward thrusts, you feel your fingers graze against a second opening at the back of your rectum. Trying to regain at least a little bit of your faculties, you focus your wild masturbation along the lines of finding out what happened there. As your exploring finger pushes against, then through, a ring-muscle, you feel a cavity beyond. That must be the pills intended effect. While your gender hasn't changed and have not sprouted any orc features, you have gained a womb within your backside!";
