Version 1 of TFTG Feats by Luneth begins here.

Section 1 - Artemis's Disciple/Apollo's Disciple
[These two feats main focus is creating both good and bad game ends focused on males becoming permanent females and vice versa with no chance of going back. This will also be paired up with the Brutalist/Worthless feats eventually. Side note: once the appearance content is added to descriptions this will also effect that.]

Divine Twins is a situation.
the sarea of Divine Twins is "Museum".
when play begins:

instead of resolving Divine Twins:
	say "     Continuing to explore the Museum, your attention is drawn to what sounds like a heated argument. Choosing to listen in on what they are fighting about, you identify that one voice is male while the other is female. The woman has a regal voice, but at the same time, there is an edge to it that speaks volumes about how it would not be wise to cross her. 'Brother, we both know that women should be the ones that should be in control. Looking at the state of this world is proof enough of this fact!' Her sibling has the same regality in his voice, however he seems to be far quicker to anger. 'The only reason that this place has advanced as far as it has is strictly because men have been the ones in charge! Females are built for nothing more than serving males and procreation!' The disagreement is clearly over gender superiority.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     [bold type]Do you really want to get involved in this situation?[roman type][line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - It could be interesting to hear.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - You have better things to do with your time.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Deciding that this could at the very least be an interesting use of your time, you slowly make your way towards the hallway that the voices seem to be coming from. Turning around the corner, you're left confused. You swear that this is where the voices were coming from, but all that you can see around you are ancient statues. Tentatively, you start to check around the effigies made of stone and marble, finding no one. Calling out in frustration, you ask if anyone is here, but all you're met with is silence, that is until you hear what sounds almost like something is vibrating. Following the sound leads you to two sculptures. One is of a beautiful huntress, wielding a great bow with the bowstring pulled back all the way, and a tiara adorns her head in the shape of a crescent moon. The other is a handsome young man, holding a lyre in one hand while the other makes a move to pluck the strings, and a chain hangs from his wrist emblazoned with a sun sigil.";
		say "     Analyzing the statues further reveals that oddly enough both of their faces seem almost eerily similar. The eyes are what catch your attention the most. Even though they are simply made of marble, they both show that same look of grim determination. The presence alone of these sculptures is almost overwhelming, and on more than one occasion, you have to stop yourself from kneeling down to bow at their feet. With everything you have seen around the city, it shouldn't be surprising that ancient statues would be affected. The nanites seem to latch onto organic material, and with everyone touching them, leaving behind skin flakes and body oils on their surfaces, it would explain how even lawn ornaments came to life. You once again feel the overwhelming desire to prostrate yourself.";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]Should you give in and kneel before these beings encased in marble?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - It can't hurt, and who knows, you may learn something if it works.";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Submitting to some random potential beings seems like a bad idea.";
		if player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     Figuring that you have nothing to lose, you settle yourself down on your knees and lean forward, placing your forehead on top of your outstretched palms. After a few minutes of nothing, you prepare to rise, feeling a bit foolish for thinking that something would happen. No sooner then when that thought enters your mind, a bright flash of light floods the room as you're thrown backwards across the room by a powerful force. You slowly begin to rise, shaking your head carefully in an attempt to clear your mind. Looking up, you see that the effigies are now glowing with a light that seems to vibrate. That must be part of what you thought you were hearing. Cautiously, you walk up to the them, not sure whether the choice you made was a good one or possibly a mistake.";
			if player is puremale:
				say "     The masculine voice that you heard earlier returns, and it seems to be coming from the statue of the man wielding the lyre. 'Ah, a handsome young man has come to pay homage. This pleases me greatly! Do you have a name, boy?' Still not sure about what exactly is going on, you introduce yourself [if player is not defaultnamed]as [name of player] [end if]and ask what you should call him. 'I have gone by many names throughout the ages, but you may refer to me as Apollo. Allow me to introduce my sister as well-' You finally hear the female speak up, cutting Apollo off. 'I do not need you to introduce me! I am hardly some lady in waiting that needs a man to be her voice! You may call me Artemis, that is if you must call me something at all.' You are speechless at first. You remember back when you were a kid in school and learned about the ancient Olympians, and here you are possibly talking with two of them!";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Looking back and forth between the siblings, you can't help but feel that while Apollos is being very friendly, Artemis doesn't seem to be very pleased with your presence. So many questions flash through your mind. Finally after taking a moment to collect yourself, you ask the most obvious one: why are they here? Apollo is the one to answer you. 'We were awoken by the screams of the dead. As deities, we are able to pick up on the sounds of mortals. When these machines were released, many were killed indiscriminately. Man, woman, child, they matter little to creations without a soul. The sounds of so many dying all at once, while tragic, are hardly rare in this world, but we came to inquire as to the reason anyway.' Taking in what Apollo just told you, your mind flashes to other times in history when so many were killed. If this has happened before, does that mean this is part of a cycle that is doomed to be repeated?";
				say "     That thought is sobering. While you are still excited by the chance to meet not one but two deities, you can't help but think about how many had to perish for this opportunity. 'Do not allow yourself to take on the burden of these crimes,' Apollo says, as if reading your mind. 'Humans with much more power bear that responsibility. While I am here though, you may ask me anything that you like.' Attempting to push down the depressing thoughts, you ask if they are here, could other divine beings be here as well? 'Of course they are! However a word of warning for you, any being that makes the [']claim of a god['] is actually attempting to assert a dominion. While some may be peaceful, others are not, and will attempt to use the chaos to return to power. This area is a prime target actually. When death and chaos swirl around each other to this extent, it is common for realms and dimensions to merge and become one.'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     This whole conversation is becoming incredibly depressing, so you attempt to bring up a topic that while probably will not be a happy one, will at least be far from sad. You bring up the argument that you had heard earlier, asking what it was about. 'Oh... that. Well as I'm sure you have heard, my sister believes that men are at fault for the state of the world, rather than blame only those who are actually responsible.' While that sounds good, you also seem to remember someone mentioning how women are only good serving men and procreation, and decide to bring that up. 'While it is true that I said those words, they were spoken out of anger. I do not actually believe them. I mean look at my twin sister, she is one of the strongest individuals that I have ever known, and she is a woman!' You are about to comment when you hear a growl come from the statue of Artemis. 'It doesn't erase what you said. How many males throughout time have said something similar!'";
				say "     You had almost forgot Artemis was still there, since she has been silent since introducing herself. Listening to both of them arguing back and forth, you begin to become frustrated. While yes siblings often fight, they are also just going around in circles. Finally, you can't take it anymore and snap, shouting out that you had enough! Both voices fall silent, and at that moment, you realize what exactly you have just done. Before you can try to apologize, you are stunned to hear Apollo laughing, his deep baritone voice sending slight shockwaves through you with each breath. 'HA! Said with no fear. You're a man after my own heart! You are right. We shouldn't be fighting as we are, especially out in the open, and since you were not afraid to let us know that, how about I offer you a boon?'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     A boon? If memory serves, that should be some sort of gift. 'The boon I offer is to become one of my disciples. With this, you will always have masculine energy surging through you, and while it may not always lead to keeping you male, it will raise the chances in dire situations.' Truth be told, you don't really know how to respond, but before you can ask any further, Artemis cuts in 'What a waste offering him that ability! Why, so he can remain as part of the problem? Male, I have a boon as well, one that is a far better choice. With mine, I can make it so that feminine energy always flows within you, and while it may seem like simply the opposite effect of my brother's gift, I'm sure that you can see why it would be far superior.'";

Doing as you are instructed, you let out a hiss as the string cuts into your palm. Pulling your hand back, you inspect it, only to find no blood, but instead a golden glow. The rest of your body begins to change slightly as well, some of your features starting to take on a more masculine appearance. 'The pact is made.

You comment on how that sounds like a fancy way to say that they couldn't be bothered. 'Hardly, it means to help yourself with the tools we have left you with. The plants, animals, metals, water, all of it. Those are a part of us, use them to survive.'

The rest of your body begins to change slightly as well, some of your features start to take on a more feminine appearance. 'The pact is made. You are now my disciple, [if player is not defaultnamed][name of player][else]hybrid[end if]. May my gift serve you well, and don't forget the gods remember those that serve them.'";

The busts that take their place are still of the same deities, but of a much more simple design. Glancing down at the mark, you can't help but feel better, like you're not alone in this fight anymore. Slowly, but with confidence, you make your way out of the hall that held the sculptures, a huge smile on your face as you leave.";

Thinking back to your youth, you remember how the gods used to play tricks on humanity, offering gifts that came with a heavy price. Rather than make a choice, you instead ask another question. If things were as bad as they are, why didn't the divine beings help everyone? Apollo is the one that answers. 'The divine only help those that help themselves.' You comment on how that sounds like a fancy way to say that they couldn't be bothered. 'Hardly, it means to help yourself with the tools we have left you with. The plants, animals, metals, water, all of it. Those are a part of us, use them to survive.' Still not happy with the answer, you turn your back to the statues and leave, telling them that you don't want a boon. You will do what has to be done all on your own.";

Section 2 - Artemis Disciple Bad Ends

Part 1 - Broken Husky Slut
[This bad end will trigger if you have the artemis disciple feat and are fully male genital wise. You must also lose to the alpha that has captured sarah, it will not activate if you lose to the regular female huskies though since the alpha will then view you as a worthless addition to his pack. WARNING: this will also overwrite the male preferred feat.]

to say BrokenHuskySlutBadend:
	say "     Falling down on one knee before the alpha husky, your bruised and battered body quickly begins to mend itself, however that does nothing to restore your will to fight. With deep shaky breaths you look up into the arrogant eyes of the beast that bested you, a cocky grin on his muzzle and a dark glint in his gaze. The girl takes advantage of the fact that you beat all of the female huskies and that the alpha seems to be focused on you at the moment to make her escape. Watching as she runs away, you are able to hear her yelling that she is sorry, but never once looking back. Oddly enough the alpha husky remains calm, not even sparing a glance for his escaped captive. 'Alright you sluts, that bitch we came for... we can always get her back later, we'll grab this one instead.' Before the female huskies can act, the male gets down on your level. 'I like your attitude, it'll be fun to break you in little bitch.'";
	say "     Your eyes widen in surprise, while you had realized that the rescue attempt failed, it hadn't occurred to you that the alpha would want more than just the girl. A flurry of white fur fills your sight as the group of husky bitches grab and restrain you. Forced to your feet, the last thing you see is the alpha's huge fist coming towards your face before everything fades to black. You slowly come back to conscious, at first you are confused and can't figure out exactly where you are. Your head is hanging upside down, all you can see at the moment is a white furred bubble butt lightly swaying with each step and a fluffy tail swinging back and forth. Starting to become much more aware of your surroundings, you realize that your body is completely naked and you begin to struggle to escape. The alpha releases a deep chuckle and as you open your mouth to speak he quickly gives a few hard smacks to your ass.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'You woke up a bit too early bitch. You're definitely a fighter I'll give you that, I knew I made the right choice, unfortunately I need you to sleep a little longer.' With that your head is rammed into the wall he is walking past, effectively knocking you out once again. Eventually you wake up once again, although this time you have a splitting headache. Looking around at your surroundings you find yourself in a pitch black room, attempting to get up you are quickly pulled back to the ground choking and coughing. Reaching your hand up you feel along your neck only to find a metal collar wrapped around your throat, following the chain attached shows it has been impaled into what feels like a cement wall. Taking a few shaky breaths in an attempt to calm yourself down, a sound manages to catch your attention, it sounds like voices.";
	say "     'Keep an ear out you sluts, I'm going to go check on our newest recruit, if you see or hear anything just shout.' A door opens allowing a bright light to enter the room, being surrounded by nothing but darkness since you awoke you can't help but be blinded by it until your eyes finally start to adjust. Standing in the doorway watching you is the same large male husky that you encountered before, the cocky smirk on his muzzle is a dead giveaway. 'Morning princess, I hope your enjoying my hospitality and got yourself some beauty sleep.' The canine enters the room and with an air of indifference he slowly makes his over, eventually coming to kneel in front of you. 'Don't worry girl, it's ok now, I won't let any of those bad monsters near you again. You're gonna make a real pretty husky slut, I can tell.' You can't help your body from shaking as you shout at the large canine that you aren't a [']girl[']!";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Without skipping a beat, the muscled alpha backhands you across your face. 'Don't you ever, and I mean ever, talk to your master like that again! Here I am being a nice guy and welcoming some worthless little wannabe whore like you into my home, only to have my generosity thrown back in my face!' You crawl backwards as far as you can in an attempt to put some distance between yourself and the angry dog, however the collar around your neck only allows so much movement. The husky reaches out with one furred hand, wrapping it around your jaw, forcing you to look him in the eye. 'I think that I deserve an apology, don't you?' The cruel face of the canine morphing into one of tenderness, almost as if the rage he just went through never happened. Although it comes out with a slight stutter, you apologize to the alpha in an attempt to buy some time and hopefully keep his anger in check. 'Good girl, see I knew you weren't bad, just needed some direction is all.'";
	say "     Without thinking, you mutter under your breath once again that you're not a girl. Realizing what you just said you look at the husky, hoping that he didn't hear you, however glancing at his powerful ears, you doubt that is the case and fully expect another backhand across the face. 'Aww, look how scared the little bitch in training is. I didn't punish you earlier for what you said, I punished you for the way you talked to your master.' Before you can react the canine reaches down, grabbing ahold of your cock and caressing your balls. 'And don't you worry darlin, I see exactly what you have between your thighs. It might look like your a man, but I see the truth, that your pussy just got turned inside out, didn't it my lil slut? Don't you worry, we'll get it back on the inside where it belongs.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A surge of endorphins course through your veins and you instantly attempt to struggle against the collar around your throat, but the alpha pays little attention to your desperate movements and simply rises to his feet. 'Truth be told I got a bit spoiled with this new world, I mean when I first changed it was like a party! I would go out, find some random dumbass on the street, fuck a few loads into them and [']BAM['] instant fuck toy. Unfortunately, a mind broken slut can never really be an ally or trusted in general to be honest, nah the only loyalty they know is to the next load that gets shot inside them. That's where you come in my newest little bitch, I realize the mistakes I made with these other cum sluts, but with you I'm gonna start fresh and train you up right.' At this point you aren't even sure if the well built husky is even talking to you anymore, or if he is simply talking to himself.";
	say "     The canine finally whips around and is once again on the floor next to you, with one paw petting you and the other holding your face, forcing you to look him in the eye. 'The others changed in a matter of hours, I think that was the mistake, they changed to fast and their pathetic minds couldn't take the strain. With you I plan on making sure we go nice and slow, making sure that you change the way I want you to and when I want you to.' The expression on his face softens for a bit, allowing you to see through the tears in your eyes that if he wasn't completely batshit crazy, he would definitely be seen as an extremely attractive male. 'Y'know when I was a kid I always wanted a puppy, sucks I had to wait so long to get a proper one.' You aren't able to hold back the sob that breaks through you, 'welcome to the family, cunt!'";
