	say "     Making your way through the campus grounds isn't as difficult as the rest of the city, but you make sure to keep your guard up. A couple of half-dressed stags stumble out of a nearby building, antlers locking together as they wrestle for dominance and move onto the front lawn. It's a situation that isn't exactly strange these days, but two bucks in rut is still something that you'd rather avoid. Crossing the street, you plan to keep moving forward, but you pause when you hear a loud yelp and a short scuffle. Something's going on around the back side of the building, and unless the collectively sixteen points of buck back there lose interest in each other long enough to hear what's going on, you're the only one that might be able to help.";

	if Player consents: [INVESTIGATE]
		LineBreak;
		say "     Crouching low and getting ready for a fight, you creep around the building into a back alley, where you find quite the scene. Two short brown mice stand leering over a muscled hunk of a golden retriever with a letterman jacket slumped against a dumpster. One of the mice is clothed in a graphic tee and baggy jeans while the other is wearing glasses and a cute little suit that has definitely seen better days. You stop, hesitating. Even two-on-one, this dog should have knocked these little guys senseless, but the mice don't even look winded. In fact, they look positively pumped, practically bouncing with excitement. The jock, however, appears a bit... spaced out, almost like he is lost in a daydream. You sneak in closer, hiding behind a broken-down car in order to hear their quiet murmurs.";
		say "     'Perfectus, you were right! Look, he's practically drooling! Oh, Arthur, I knew you had the brains for this operation!' the mouse on the left pushes up his glasses as he squeaks with giddiness to his companion. The second one proudly hoists a small box-shaped device with a grin. 'I told you it would work! Dad was a genius! Now... what shall we do with our old friend Landon, hmm?' Both of the rodents turn their attention back to their quarry, and with a dark chuckle, the one with the device hands it over to the spectacled mouse and crouches down in front of the golden retriever. Reaching out, he begins to shimmy down the retriever's pants and jockstrap, revealing the canine's sheath. With one hand kneading the dog's balls, he speaks softly enough that you have to crane out from your cover to hear, 'Yeah, that's a good boy... Just focus on how awesome your master is gonna make you feel...'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The retriever slowly nods in response, beginning to pant as his sheath swells up and his red prick slowly rises from its furry pouch. The standing mouse looks slightly uncomfortable at this turn of events as he wrings his paws together, 'Umm, Arthur, what are you doing? I thought that we were just going humiliate him...' From your hiding place, you can see that the mouse whose name you've learned is Arthur roll his eyes. 'Don't worry, Reece. We will, but you need to think about this in the long term. We could totally have our own personal servant. I mean, shouldn't this mutt have to answer for all of the shit he put you through?' This seems to give the other mouse, Reece, pause. 'Well I guess that makes sense, but we aren't going to actually hurt him or anything, right?'";
		say "     Arthur seems to be getting more and more frustrated with Reece's questions. 'Of course not, bro. It would be pretty stupid to damage our own property, don't ya think?' Judging by his mouth falling open, this comment shocks the spectacled mouse. 'Arthur... I can't believe that you would say something like that about Landon. I mean, I know that he has been giving me a hard time lately, but the two of you used to be best friends!' Without contemplating his brother's words for even a second, Arthur immediately responds with a relaxed, 'Things change.' A grin spreading over his features, he continues to molest the dazed dog while Reece begins to pace around the alley, apparently trying to figure out what to make of the situation.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Pretty soon though, your ears pick up some soft whispers from your vantage point, 'Time to play with that noob's morality crap.' With that, Arthur leans in close to Landon and starts to mutter something into his ear that you can't quite make out. After pulling away, the look on the goldie's muzzle changes, where before he appeared to have a vacant look on his face, now it is replaced with a huge grin. The one thing that hasn't changed though are his eyes. They still have that... empty look to them, almost like a doll's or maybe even a puppet's. 'Hey, squirt, what's the matter?' Landon's voice shocks Reece from his pacing, actually causing the small rodent to jump into the air. 'L-Landon? How are you... ahem, you haven't called me that in years.'";
		say "     A strange sounding bark of laughter erupts from the canine's throat. 'I had always looked forward to seein['] ya whenever I visited your guys['] place. You were always so sweet, trying to make sure that I was taken care of.' This seems to have the opposite effect on the mouse than was intended, his whole body beginning to shake, and you can clearly see the rage behind his spectacles. 'Then why have you been making my life a living nightmare lately?!' The dog doesn't seem fazed at all by the sudden outburst. 'Ya know I saw ya, squirt. Whenever I stayed the night to hang out with your bro, I knew that you would watch me in the shower.' The anger that the smaller mouse had been exuding quickly dissipates, and Reece looks incredibly guilty for the moment.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Something seems off though about the way that Landon is talking, almost as if he was just repeating a script, his voice having no inflection to it. 'Did ya like watching me naked and wet, lil['] dude? How is this any different? Why don't you touch yourself like you used to whenever you watched me?' The spectacled mouse can't help but moan at this and gives in to lust, his own hand diving into his slacks. 'Landon, I couldn't help myself. That charming face and all of those muscles!' Arthur quickly grabs the retriever's bone and begins to excitedly jerk the dog off. Surprisingly, despite the apparent signs of him being lost in pleasure, the jock looks to be barely conscious, lazily staring into the distance, drool dripping from his panting muzzle. These mice must have drugged the poor retriever, which explains why he didn't do more damage to the much smaller rodents.";
		say "     With Arthur busy jerking off the muscled hunk and Reece busy jerking off himself, you could rush in there and take them both by surprise, freeing the hunk and allowing him to shake off whatever influence he is under. Or, thinking about it, if you stayed back and afterwards followed them back to their hideout, you might be able to obtain whatever it is that they are using for your own ends, not to mention that you'd get the benefit of watching these two nerds finish doing their thing.";

[end if]You step over their bodies and move to the retriever's side. Being careful not to get the jock's drool on you, you give him a few slaps on the face to wake him up. Thankfully, the big lug soon blinks a couple of times and sits up, startled and confused. Looking down to find his pants at his ankles and his dick hard, with you leaning over him, the muscular dog's brows draw together, and his lips pull back from his sharp teeth, so you throw your hands up in a consoling gesture and explain what happened. A couple more blinks and some glances to the unconscious mice, and he nods his head, believing your story. He does however seem startled when told the names of the mice. 'That's crazy, bro. Did you get a load of whatever they used to make me all dumb?'";
				say "     Resisting the urge to joke about 'making' him dumb, you quickly scan the scene of the fight. Meanwhile, Landon gets to his feet and wanders after you as if to help looking. It doesn't take long to spot the device that Reece was holding before your surprise attack. You walk over and pick it up, giving it a quick inspection. The black box features a cracked lens at one end and a small button keypad on the other. You push a couple of buttons to test it and are rewarded with a loud spark and plume of black smoke in your face. Yeah, you think that you aren't getting anything out of that. It must have broken in the fight, but at least the mice won't be able to use it either, once they finally wake up. However, it might come in handy to hold onto it. You never know if you could find a way to repair it.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     'Killer, dude! Can't believe these dumb losers have stuff like this,' the canine you saved says as he steps up beside you and looks down at the broken device in your hands. He laughs and puts his arm around your shoulders. 'Who knows what they would've have done to me had you not showed up. My girl would've probably been really mad if they were making me screw other chicks.' He stops and gets a horrified look on his face, prompting you to ask what he's thinking. 'Aw, man, just... what if they wanted me to screw other bros? Do you think 'No Homo' counts when you're bein['] brainwashed or whatever? That is not what Landon does.' The jock shudders before he lets go of you. You make a mental note that Landon has yet to zip up his pants, nor has his raging erection subsided since your rescue, but you don't say anything, letting him continue, 'Anyways, bro, you helped me out, so I'll help you out. I got some supplies that I can share with ya to show my thanks.' He collects a bottle of water and a packet of food from a nearby dropped backpack that apparently is his, which you graciously accept.";
				say "     Landon stands close to you as you pack the reward for his rescue away. You don't see when the mice scamper off, but sure enough, as soon as you lift your head, the nerds have vanished. Your saved muscled hunk also starts to walk off, but he turns around and gives you a wink. 'Maybe I'll see you around, bro?' You nod, and have to wonder if maybe that little box did more damage than he realizes. Either way, you pack the supplies away and make your way back onto the road where you entered. Out of curiosity, you look back to where those stags were fighting before, but all you see is a single cum-stained varsity jacket, lying forgotten on the lawn. Must have gotten hot and heavy. You shrug and continue onwards, happy that you could help at least one person out in this crazy mouse-zap-dog world.";

				say "     With one last blow, you crumple backwards next to the very retriever that you meant to save. You look up and see the bare-assed hunk, his pants still at his ankles ever since you interrupted the nerds['] fun. Refusing to become their next plaything, you struggle to push yourself up, but pause when you come face to face with the hunk's rock hard cock. You're surprised to find it still holding strong and leaking precum profusely while you were fighting for his honor. Taking advantage of your distraction, a small foot plants into your battered side, and, without any energy to resist, you collapse on your side, staring up at the winners of the fight. Looking up into Arthur's face, the mouse says, 'Look at this little twerp! Did you actually think that you could beat [']me[']? I'm way too high a level for some crappy noob like you to beat!' Reece picks this moment to also pipe up, 'Guess we're superior to them in mind [italic type]and[roman type] in body!'";
				say "     That gets a laugh out of his companion, but before you can come up with a witty retort, the other one, Arthur, hushes you. There's a glint of unbridled lust and maybe something worse, unhinged even, in his eyes as the geek leans in close. 'Don't worry, you'll be nice and obedient like our other pet over here.' Spotting a moment to get in a jab, you spit in the mouse's face, blood and saliva globbing into his short whiskers. Arthur's smile is wiped from his face and replaced with a cruel smirk as he straightens back up and looks to the mouse with the black box. 'Reese, hit this loser with the ray. I'm tired of it being able to think.' With a worried expression on his snout, the spectacled mouse quickly nods to Arthur and points the box at you, allowing you to see the lens rotating as it focuses on your defiant sneer, and with a --";

Wiping it off with the back of your hand, you stand up and that's when you notice a wet sensation between your [if Player is female]thighs[else]buttocks[end if]. Looking around and seeing no immediate witnesses, you reach back and feel around, encountering something sticky leaking out of your hole. Bringing your hand around to look at some of the goop, you see its creamy white appearance. Even as your mind reels to remember how that cum got there, your hand subconsciously keeps moving, bringing the finger closer and closer to your face. As soon as the rich, musky smell of semen hits your nostrils, you can't help but pop it into your mouth, savoring the mousey taste. Then you freeze. What the hell are you doing? Thinking right now is like swimming through a murky jello. Remembering how exposed you are, you quickly grab your gear and do your best to scurry back to safety.";

The one named Arthur speeds up his manhandling of the jock, paying special attention to his balls and his growing knot. The spaced-out retriever's panting quickly becomes more rapid, his thick dog paws curling in rapture as his body shudders with lust and, of course, whatever is coursing through his system. 'Yeah, that's it,' Arthur leans in to murmur into his victim's ear, forcing you to perk your ears to catch the words. 'Good boys can't help but feel this way around their mousey master, isn't that right?'";

Arthur's low droning continues in the background as you focus on the one hanging back closer to you. Just before you turn your attention back to watching as the dog unwittingly becomes these mice's slut, you stop when you notice the masturbating nerd pull up the box he's been holding, pointing it at the jock. As he pushes a button, a flash erupts from the other end. Pausing your own self-help, you quickly look to Arthur and the dog, trying to see what exactly the device did. You're not sure if it was the flash or simply Arthur knowing his way around a dog's knot, but all you see is the retriever finally bursting as thick ropes of canine cum pulse from his lengthy prick.";

Spent, you take a moment to recover, shaking your head as the adrenaline dies down. A scoff breaks you from your thoughts, and you look up in time to watch Arthur laugh at his partner, 'You just freaking creamed your own pants, bro! I can't believe it!' Reece blushes a deep shade of red underneath his short fur.";

'Look, man, you could have [italic type]literally[roman type] gone on the ground just like this sack of meat over here, but you went in your own pants. I think that you just wanted to smell like yourself.' Reece shakes his head, stammering as he adjusts his glasses, 'J-Just get him up so we can take him back to the dorms, okay?' Getting ready to move, you watch as the two mice spend some time just trying to figure out how to pick up the heavy jock in the first place, before Arthur finally decides to get the bright idea of stealing a wheelbarrow from the campus gardening club and rolling the still-drooling mutt into it. You shake your head in disbelief. While Arthur seems to be in charge, he definitely didn't think this through properly.";

While you know they are brothers, the things that Arthurs says makes it apparent that this is at the very least an abusive relationship or possibly just the way they have always been. Either way, once you arrive behind what you think is the building for the male dorms, you're forced to hang back as they push the hunk through the back door. You spend some time thinking of how exactly you're going to find out which room they went to, when fortune strikes, and you see none other than Arthur himself opening the curtains of one of the windows on the third floor. Quickly counting along the back of the building, you think that you've figured out which dorm is theirs, or at the very least, which one they're keeping the retriever in. Resolving to come back once you've prepared yourself, you head back out into the campus proper. Those mice won't know what hit them.";

The mouse in the graphic tee begins to walk in circles around your bent over form, chuckling to himself as he strokes your head as if you're some sort of pet. It's the spectacled mouse that speaks up first, 'Arthur, what are you doing? Shouldn't we just grab Landon and go? I mean, they don't have anything to do with this!' With his back still to his brother, Arthur rolls his eyes in agitation, but quickly plasters a fake smile on his snout. 'Bro, this is one of that mutt's friends that were making fun of you! I thought that you wanted revenge for being bullied, and here you are wanting to let one of them go?'";

The dominate mouse then steps away from you with a dark chuckle and walks over to his brother. Pulling a water bottle out of the back pocket of his baggy jeans, Arthur offers it to Reece. 'Here, why don't you take a drink? You know that you always think clearer when hydrated.' The suited rodent smiles at the other, thanking him before swiftly chugging the water bottle. At first, nothing happens, but eventually, Reece takes off his glasses and pinches the bridge of his snout. 'Thank you, Arthur. I think that I needed that. I can already feel one of my headaches creeping up.'";

Not sure what exactly is going on at the moment, you are shocked out of your thoughts by the sound of a belch coming from the second, usually prim and proper mouse. Looking at Reece, it appears as if he is slightly intoxicated, and he lets out a bark of seemingly random laughter. 'Alright, bro, let's fuck this slut!' Something is definitely wrong, not just with the way Reece is acting, but also by his speech. He almost seems like a completely different person than the meek being you have seen so far. Arthur chuckles maniacally. 'Only if you're sure, buddy. I mean, I wouldn't want[']cha to do anything you would regret later.'";

'Does it matter? We can always just switch if we get bored, right, bro?' Whatever was in that bottle that Arthur gave his brother, it either lowered his intelligence, or just majorly reduced his inhibitions. The dominant mouse walks up to your backside and roughly smacks your backside, causing it to jiggle a bit from the impact. 'I will be taking this end first. You use its mouth first, bro!' Reece, while looking a bit stoned, hobbles over to your face and begins to undo his dress pants. 'Wait, Reece!' For a moment, you actual think that Arthur is going to call this whole messed up thing off, but instead he says to you, 'I want you to beg me to stop, plead with everything you have for me to let you go!'";

You want to yell out, but all you can do is lay there like a doll that is waiting for someone to pull their strings as your hole is stretched wide. 'Now I want you to tell me how great you feel and how much you love my cock, ya little slut!'

We both know that my dick's bigger than the one you're wielding, haha.' Going by how brutal the one behind you begins to pummel your insides, he is none to pleased by what he was just told, but you hardly have time to think on that before a rock-hard cock is rammed down your throat.

Section 5 - Notes&Comments
[WARNING SPOILERS!]


[Expansion Plans:

Arthur- Expand on the sadistic gamer who wants the player all to themselves. The older brother of the two, but he is not nearly as "smart" as his younger brother Reece, thus he needs him for tech stuff that comes with the hypno ray. I would like to show exactly how dark he can be when his brother isn't around. The route I'm thinking is the "gamer with a god complex". Basically he believes that everyone and everything should bow down and serve him in any way he sees fit. He will also serve as the more brutal dom, meaning he will enjoy doing whatever he wants to the player and seeing them as nothing more than a toy and property.

Reece- Expand on the shy nerd who just wants to make a stand. The younger brother of the two, he is the "brains" of the team, while not nearly as cruel and power hungry as his brother, he does desire to be a dominant male. For the most part he doesn't actually realize how twisted his brother is. He will also serve as the more chivalrous dom, meaning that he has a dominant heart, but has never had the opportunity to let it loose. The player will have the option to help him assert himself. His form of dominance would be more akin to a knight saving the prince/princess and claiming them, with the intent of pushing them over the edge and getting off on blowing the other persons mind.

Landon- Expand on the childhood friend of Arthur. The two of them lost touch long ago, that is until he decided to make bullying Reece one of his favorite pastimes. The very definition of a "dumb jock", Landon's only concern is for himself and he's far from being a true victim.

Routes:

Arthur- The player will have to deal with giving into their new master, or possibly fighting back to either enslave him or merely end his "reign".

Reece- The player will have to decide whether to get close to Reece or push him away, if you get close then prove to be a trusted friend or a loving partner.

Landon- The player will have to decide whether they should try to free him or not, you will also have to decide how you're relationship with him should progress.

These are some simple route combination ideas. Keep in mind these are the basic ideas, meaning that there will be more deciding factors including feats and choices. The characters will also act different depending on the various roles, for example, Arthur will overall act different in hypnoslut than he will in fallen savior since he longer has to keep up his image with Reece and so on.

Hypnoslut- The player basically stays as a hypno toy for the two brothers, but is owned by Arthur. A good way to look at this combination would be as follows from the above list. The player gave in to Arthur, did not romance/friendzone Reece, and did not bother to connect with Landon or free him.

Fallen Savior- Reece attempts to free the player, but ends up being hypnotized and enslaved by Arthur as well. A good way to look at this combination would be as follows from the above list. The player gave in to Arthur, did romance/friendzone Reece, and did not bother to connect with Landon or free him.

Big Mistake- The player ends up trying to free Landon from the brothers way to early, but the favor is returned by being enslaved along with the brothers by Landon who now wants to be a king. A good way to look at this combination would be as follows from the above list. The player gave in to Arthur, did not romance/friendzone Reece, and did not bother to connect with Landon but did free him.

Large and in charge- the player romances/friendzones Reece and in secret hypnotizes both Arthur and Landon into their toys. A good way to look at this combination would be as follows from the above list. The player did not give in to Arthur, did romance/friendzone Reece, and did connect with Landon but didn't free him.

Hypnoking- Player turns all three into hypnoslaves. A good way to look at this combination would be as follows from the above list. The player did not give in to Arthur, did not romance/friendzone Reece, and did not bother to connect with Landon or free him.
