Looking up at you with those huge eyes, it almost feels like he is looking deep inside of your soul. Well it would if not even a second later, he scuttles quickly back to his home and gently places the pebble that you gave him right next to the opening. Deciding that he has had enough of playtime, Snips turns to face you before raising up a single claw almost to say goodbye. He makes his way back into his little tunnel, obviously tuckered out.
