The exception are the bees; they're tolerated for their benefit to the local flora and their delicious honey. Because of this, Honey - who accompanied you back to the park - is welcomed by the black equinoids of the herd and lavished with attention. They show her a lovely tree surrounded by flowers, and she soon sets up her home there, becoming a new queen bee and raising a new hive. Because of your bond with her, there is a peaceful alliance between the herd and the hive. The bears are kept away, the hive thrives, and the equinoids are allowed to harvest honey in peace.";

They seem friendly enough at first, but the bees overhear them secretly whispering about making your people into slaves and whores. Warriors at heart, the herd attacks and drives off these foul, urban horses before they can enact their unsavory schemes. With the herd's numbers and the bees on watch from the air, these interlopers are kept from raiding, and some are even captured and made to accept the proper ways of a natural, equine warrior.";

Still sensing a faint connection in your failing mind, you are able to coax the scared bee girl into your arms and, with the help of the others, help her to become a lovely wasp like yourselves.

You spend many a sunny day in her hidden hive with attention lavished on you both by her and her many lovely and lustful drones[if HP of bee girl >= 5].
