Section 1 - Monster Responses

when play begins:
	add { "Caveman" } to infections of guy;

to say losetocaveman:
	say "     The massively muscled beastman swipes your feet out from under you and plants his large hairy feet on either side of your head. He raises his arms above his head in triumph, the oversized biceps bigger than his own head as he roars in victory.";
	say "     Having announced his win to any creature within ear shot, the cromagnon stud has other ideas for you. You look up and see him tear off his loin cloth, exposing a huge, erect penis. He tugs on it with his giant fist, his freakishly proportioned hand making the dick look smaller than it is. It is not small.";
	if cunts of player > 0:
		say "     He grabs you roughly by your [facename of player] face and flips you around, pressing a huge hand into your back and holding you down. You feel a finger exploring, pushing under you. It is long and thick, bigger than most human cocks and soon it is up inside of your [cunt size desc of player] cunt.";
		say "     The caveman grunts as he finger fucks you, the grunts growing louder as you begin moaning. Soon, he pulls out the finger and you feel something else pressing against your crotch. You wonder if it is his wooden club, but soon realize it is the caveman's huge prehistoric cock, stretching open your pussy lips around its head.";
		say "     His animalistic instincts take over and he begins fucking his huge dick in and out of you with ferocity and power unexpected from something so close to human.";
		say "     Caring nothing for your pleasure he rams in and out of you, his hairy ballsac smacking against you roughly. You are thankful that it doesn't take very long until the massive club of a caveman cock begins to fire off inside of you, hot cromagnon spunk filling you up in a voluminous quantity.";
		say "     He pulls out, his cock dribbling more spunk onto your naked ass. Wiping himself off, using your [bodydesc of player] body as a towel before turning and leaving, the caveman abandons you there with nothing but a grunt of smug satisfaction.";
	otherwise:
		say "     He grabs you roughly by your [facename of player] face and flips you around, pressing a huge hand into your back and holding you down. Grunting angrily when he sees you don't have what he is looking for, he turns you back around.";
		say "     Enormous hands hold your head steady and squeeze your mouth open. You try to speak or scream, but before you can, the dripping huge head of the caveman's cock is shoved roughly inside of your face. He begins rocking back and forth, feeding you more and more of his prehistoric wang. You can't help but be impressed with the size and power of the tool and the caveman wielding it and soon you find yourself moaning, desperate to taste the nectar of this brute.";
		say "     You don't have to wait long, as the caveman shoves deep into your throat, past your gag reflex and begins to unload his monstrous, hairy nuts into your throat and stomach. The infected cum backs up into your mouth and you can taste him as he pulls out in satisfaction, cum spraying everywhere, then turns and leaves you there, on your knees and covered in his semen.";

to say beatthecaveman:
	say "     You defeat the caveman, who collapses to the ground after dropping his club with a sad grunt.";
	if libido of player > 40:
		say "     The big muscular brute looks so inviting lying on the ground nursing his wounds. Do you take advantage of the defeated caveman?";
		if the player consents:
			say "     You smile down at the caveman and tease him with a grunt of your own before having your way with him.";
			if cunts of player > 0:
				say "     You rip off the devolved man's loincloth, exposing his throbbing meat, over a foot of caveman cock for you to ride. He gives out a questioning grunt, unsure of your intentions.";
				say "     You show him exactly what you want as you stroke his huge cock a few times, spreading his precum over it, making it nice and wet before you straddle it and ease the thick head into your [cunt size desc of player] vagina.";
				say "     His cromagnon grunts turn to moans as you bounce up and down on his big prehistoric dong, using it for your own pleasure. It's a luxury being with a creature so well built and strong, he can take a nice rough rider on top of him with ease.";
				say "     You explode with ecstasy on top of him as he begins to cum inside of you, filling you with prehistoric spunk. Still too beat up to move, you lift yourself off him and leave him moaning on the ground, his dick still hard.";
			otherwise if cocks of player > 0:
				say "     You rip off his loincloth and slap his tight, muscular, and hairy ass. You massage the beefy muscles of his prehistoric butt and place your [cock size desc of player] [cock of player] cock in between the massive cheeks. The caveman grunts beneath you nervously, knowing what comes next.";
				say "     You shove into him hard, spreading out that ass as you fill him with your [cock of player] dick. Wasting no time in using the warm chute of the caveman, pistoning in and out, using him like he wanted to use you. You shove deep and hard, hilting into that sweet ass as you pump your cum deep into the caveman's guts.";
			otherwise:
				say "     You can't pass up the throbbing dick barely contained by the loincloth. You rip it off and go down on the caveman, greedily licking and sucking the huge meat, your moans drowned out only by the moans of the cromagnon man. Soon you are rewarded with a powerful blast of caveman cum in your mouth and you swallow down the gift before moving on.";	
		otherwise:
			 say "     You leave the caveman on the ground, having no interest in the brute.";

to say cavemandesc:
	say "     A caveman straight out of the prehistoric exhibit stands before you. This large, hunched over man is not made of wood or wax however. Even with the cromagnon posture, the hairy humanoid stands at about six feet tall and would be much taller if he stood straight. Massively muscular arms hang down with oversized hands scraping the floor. His feet are gigantic, with toes that are long and nimble.";
	say "     His face is almost human, with a shaggy haircut that almost covers up his trademark heavy brow ridge and large nose. His enormous barrel chest is covered in hair, somewhere between body hair and fur. He wears nothing but a loin cloth and you can see a huge soft cock and enormous hairy nuts hanging from below its ragged hem.";
	say "     He sees you and grunts loudly. Somewhere he has found a huge wooden club and he bashes it against the floor threateningly.";

Section 3 - Endings

when play ends:
	if bodyname of player is "Caveman":
		if humanity of player is less than 10:
			say "     You succumb to your caveman infection, your mind regressing to a simpler, devolved state. You find the city confusing and troublesome and run away until you find a comfortable cave deep in the woods, away from everyone else.";
		otherwise:
			say "     You survive, but you can never live a normal life. Most of the other survivors are furry and have started their own community, but you are almost human, but not quite. The only work you can find is as a subject in college lectures about prehistory and evolution, until a construction foreman sees the massive arms and hands on your freakish body and puts them to good use. The work is hard and simple, perfect for your devolved mind.";
