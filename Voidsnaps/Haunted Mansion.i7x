You barely have time to duck into a small side alley before a colossal wyvern comes in, swooping low along the street, landing with outstretched claws on a minivan, which crumples under the giant lizard's weight. Then a second or two later, you realize that it's not just one wyvern, but two, as a second beast lands not far from the first, this one clearly male, with a magnificent crown of horns and an already extended cock drooling thick goop onto the street as he approaches the first, female wyvern.";

Doing your best to avoid stepping on any trash strewn across the ground, you pass a smelly dumpster and are almost at the other end of the alley when your gaze falls upon the side door of a building bearing a sign reading 'Staff Only.' It's barely shut, held in place by a busted lock carelessly looped through the latch. Pausing right in front of the door, you listen for a second but don't catch anything noticeable over the wyvern's racket, then slowly pull open the door.

'Funny to see you here. I was planning to race through the car wrecks, but I guess THAT freerunning course is being 'renovated' right now.'

There's an unmistakable rhythm to the arcane fuckery, and you're almost impressed by how realistic the cock plunging in and out of his pussy looks. If you didn't know better, you could mistake it for a real, though oddly blue canine cock. Experimentally, you grip the knot at the base of the ghostly cock, squeezing it and delighting in its firmness and realism. It even feels like it's got blood pumping through it! It's no wonder that Sascha's rocking his hips, desperate to get the knot into his needy pussy. It must feel as good as the real thing! As you feel along the swinging balls, impressed by their churning motion, you realize you could aid the cock's path into Sascha's insides from this position. Sascha wants the knot, and you're willing to help him get it. Why shouldn't you help him enjoy himself?";
	say "     Taking hold of the base of the canine cock as it pumps away into Sascha's dripping snatch, you apply gentle pressure, forcing the arcane appendage to bounce back against your other hand, then deeper into Sascha. A delighted, finger-muffled moan encourages you, and soon you're stuffing that bulb of pseudo-flesh past Sascha's lips, sealing it inside of him and setting off a desperate frenzy of shallow humps from the mindless disembodied dick. Now firmly knotted on a frantically tugging cock, Sascha groans and squirms, leaking arousal from his overstuffed cunt. A delighted, high-pitched squeal echoes through the room once the knot finally slurps free, and Sascha goes limp, twitching with the cock's renewed thrusts and panting away. It seems that the hands haven't finished with him, and even as he lies there with his legs spread, they redouble their efforts, working him into desperation once more. While it might be hot to watch the blissed-out kitty get fucked into unconsciousness, you doubt he'll last much longer in this condition. Maybe you should find some way to help him!";

Setting aside your gear and grasping your freed cock, you raise yourself to avoid the plunging canine cock's rampage and line yours up with the pretty kitty's tight ass. Hissing through your teeth, you slip into Sascha's well-used ass, gripping his cheeks and working him open with gentle thrusts. He's so soft, like slippery silk, and his inner walls work your cock with ease, encouraging you to go balls deep. Impossible to resist, he brings you to a fever pitch as you slam into his perfect ass, painting his innards with copious pre and almost matching the slapping rhythm of the ghostly cock ruining his pussy.

As you slowly withdraw, you pat the pretty kitty's rump, leaving him with the phantom cock still stirring his dribbling cunt and his ass dripping your cum. His tail twitches and wraps around your wrist, and he winks over his shoulder as if telling you to take your time before melting into the teasing embrace of his disembodied lovers.

Carefully, you roll two fingers past the plunging phantom cock, then guide your shaft alongside it, biting your lip as the pistoning dick almost butts your balls, sawing against your underside and spreading Sascha's wetness down your length. It takes some work to avoid the canine cock's mindless thrusting (you doubt that it would feel good to have its balls slamming into yours at full speed) though eventually, you figure out an angle that lets you line yourself up. Encouraged by Sascha's purring and attempts to spear himself on your hard cock, you alternate your rhythm with the ghostly canine appendage, grinding your underside against it and stretching the captive kitty's pussy with slow thrusts until you're deep inside of him. It's an extremely tight fit, but thankfully Sascha's so wet, and your phantom neighbor is so tireless that all you have to do is pump your hips and enjoy the ride, letting the delightful suction of his pussy work your cock.";

A sudden gush of pussy juices and rhythmic clenches, accompanied by wildly squirming feline thighs, shows you that Sascha's enjoying himself as much as you are, and you settle in, feeling your finish slowly rise. Groaning aloud, you hilt yourself, gritting your teeth as the tireless knotted cock shoves you over the edge into an intense orgasm and stirs your cum into a foamy mess. Trapped in Sascha's overstuffed cunt, you try your best to pull out, but the ghostly dick's tireless shoves make that challenging, and before you can extricate yourself, your poor, oversensitive shaft is milked of another orgasm, popping free and dousing Sascha's throbbing clit in another thick load of cream. Shivering, you lie there to recover, listening to Sascha's needy sex as your cum amplifies the slurping sounds echoing through the room, accompanied by his satisfied purrs. As much as you'd like to stay and see whether the ghostly fingers run out of steam before the hypersexual kitty, you should find a way to free him. Gathering your gear, you spare one more glance at the glowing fuckfest, then turn to leave.";

Frustrated, you try every book in the place, slamming them down on a nearby wooden table and leaning against the wall. 'You're looking in the wrong playsh.' A slurred, drunken voice from behind you startles you out of your thoughts, and you turn around to see something vaguely shimmering before you.

The drunken ghost says in a sing-song voice, his form vibrating with excitement and his finger shaking as he points to the furthest wine bottle. 'It'sh a great shecret. Might shave your little friend!' He continues. Despite his lack of features, he seems excited, and his voice wavers slightly. You contemplate being selfish, but you have no use for a dusty old bottle of wine, so you dutifully pop the cork out of its tip, then awkwardly push the bottle toward the specter's face, pouring the contents of the bottle where you assume his face is.

Sighing and preparing to free Sascha from another sexually charged trap, you plod after him, blinking as the gloomy ambiance gives way to brighter lighting.

A quick stroll around the bound demon reveals his ass is utterly destroyed, currently occupied by two plunging cocks that alternate and stir his loose backside, puffing his hole until it's swollen and almost equine-looking from the knots' tugging. Stroking, rubbing, frantically milking hands occupy nearly every inch of the demonic reptile's body, touching every possible erogenous zone. Judging by the demon's half-hard, leaking cock, they aren't allowing it to finish, despite their efforts. How long has the creature been here? What did he do to deserve such a punishment?

He pants, and an expression that you'd expect to see on a loyal dog's face paints his reptilian features as he enfolds Sascha in a massive bearhug, his draconic cheeks rubbing against Sascha's naked chest.
