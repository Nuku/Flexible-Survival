[Resolution Variables:
 Last stand:
 1 - Player exiled Ziix. Blocks off becoming royalty and expanding the hive.
 2 - Player Saved Ziix. Ziix will act grateful.
 3 - Player ignored Ziix. Zant saves him instead. Ziix will be embarassed.

 Rude Awakening:
 1 - Player fucked Zant.
 2 - Player declined Zant.

 Broken But Alive:
 1 - Ziix has been exiled. Content involving becoming king is walled off. Slut storage content possible?
 2 - Ziix and Zant reunited. Player saved Ziix so he's awake.
 3 - Ziix and Zant reunited. Zant wakes Ziix up through horny pheromones.

 Relevant NPC Variables:
 Thirst of Zant: Number of wasps that the player has birthed as the Wasp King. Changes the hive's appearance and layout. Also unlocks Byz.

 Hunger of Ziix: Whether you declined to be king or became king. Walls off that path if it's at 100.
 81 - Convinced to stay in an apartment as your fucktoy.
 99 - Became King. (Unlocks another scene to regain king infection.)
 100 - Brought up being the king and then decided against it.

It's the warmest and most caring you've ever seen him, and when he notices you're awake, he throws his arms around you for a surprising embrace. 'My king!' He murmurs with excitement before disengaging, his antennae entwining with yours and his hands roaming over your newly changed body. 'I was worried about you. You've been unresponsive.' Wings buzzing, he steps back and helps you to your feet, supporting you as you wobble on your new appendages. 'I'm sure you're very busy, but try to stay safe out there. I'll be watching over you.'";

Is it because he just orgasmed his brains out, or is he relieved that his hive now has a future? Either way, he looks much more handsome with a slight smile. Shouldering your pack, you say goodbye and ready yourself to leave, mulling over your new responsibilities. After you pump out some sons for the hive, you should return to check on your subjects.";

You apologize to Ziix for getting his hopes up, hoping he doesn't hold it against you. 'No... It's fine. I can't ask you to do something you're unwilling to accept.' Sighing, Ziix sags against his spot. 'I suppose, with only Zant and myself... Maybe it's for the best.' Gloomily, he asks to be left alone, disappointed by your answer. You don't think you should bring up the subject again. You might send the poor wasp warrior into a depression.";
