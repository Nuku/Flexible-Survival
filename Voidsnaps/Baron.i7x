The place reminds you of a new-age crystal infested hippy store, and the scents that waft from every direction overwhelm you, setting the room spinning. It's hard to remember why you entered this place, and you're about to leave, when a buttery smooth voice breaks you out of your stupor. 'Why hello there. It's been a while since I've seen a new face around here. I was beginning to think my choice of venue was problematic.' A muscular iguana dressed in a outfit that reminds you of a stereotypical witchdoctor greets you, the beads and animal bones festooning his masculine body rattling as he claps a companionable hand on your shoulder. 'What are we looking for today, hmm? Ol' Baron's got a cure for anything that ails you.' Guiding you to a counter that's little more than a cardboard box draped with a table cloth, the iguana sits, crossing his legs and giving you an eyeful of a peculiar sight in the process. His crotch is smooth and bare, with no hint of a genital slit, balls or a pussy. It seems he's a neuter.";

A forest green hole winks at you, already slightly agape, and you feel your face flush as you realize how much Baron must use it to get it so loose. 'Pretty, isn't it? I've never had any complaints.' Baron coos as he sits back, silencing any reply and pressing that slightly gaping hole against your lips. He's so relaxed on top of you that all of his weight rests on your face, sealing you in the fragrant depths of that perfect ass, and his hands busy themselves at your crotch, tugging your pants down to free your [if Player is male]hardening cock [else if Player is female]feminine sex [else]sensitive null-bulge[end if].";

Trailing that jiggly rump lower along your body, Baron brings it to rest as your cock flops between those pretty green cheeks, your tip angled against that slightly agape hole. All it takes is the slightest pearl of pre to ease your way, and the meltingly soft inner walls just past that hole welcome you, taking every inch until bubbly cheeks grind against your lower stomach.";

It's so well-trained that you're sure you won't last long, and honestly, you don't want to! Blasting your load into the slutty shop owner was always the goal- so why not speed it up! With that in mind, you grip his hips, thrusting wildly upward in time with every bounce. No matter how hard you go, there's no protest, not even a wayward clench, and you're able to pound to your heart's content, working up a sweat and squirting your desire with every thrust, every added bit of lubrication adding to the lewd sounds echoing through the alcove. One final titanic shove brings you to the hilt just as the dam breaks, and you flood Baron's ass, painting his innards white and falling backward as your hips buck gently in time with each desperate, gooey shot.";

If you weren't so wrapped in the afterglow of a good fuck, you'd be worried about what the shaman will do with your cum, but you only have eyes for that creamy ass, feeling your exhausted cock throb as if begging for another round. 'Don't worry.' Baron says with a wink, spreading his cheeks to show off the mess you made and chuckling as you swallow the drool it brings to your mouth. 'Think of it as an insurance policy. You get whatever you like, and I have leverage if you ever get on my bad side. Ol' Baron's always on the lookout for a win/win.' Ever cryptic, the slutty shopkeep pats your messy stomach, setting aside the jar full of your seed. You recover in that back room, attended to with a wet cloth and soft fingers, and stand up feeling refreshed, thanking Baron for his attention. You can't resist giving that bubbly ass one last squeeze, and judging by the way he leans into your touch, letting your fingers graze his cum-slick hole, you assume he's as into it as you are. You'll have to return next time you want to dump a load in him- Possible magical consequences be damned!";

You've already proven you're willing to put your life on the line for him, but you're not sure what that entails! 'Ah.' Leaning against the counter, Baron contemplates you, wiggling his raised tail and wobbling his raised rump in thought. 'Perhaps you could summon this son of yours. Ol' Baron has experience, but your 'demon' sounds like quite the sadist. Wouldn't want to stumble upon any traps woven on the poor thing.' Flicking his tail, Baron raises his voice, looking past you. 'Or he can come out! I see you there, child. Ol' Baron doesn't bite unless you ask him to!'";
	say "     With a guilty expression and a lowered head, Janaz plods into the room, sitting at your feet. He seems almost shy around Baron, unable to meet his gaze. Even Kal Ren doesn't elicit this kind of automatic respect. What exactly is Baron? 'Hmm.' Crossing the distance between them, the lizard inspects Janaz's muzzle, pulling his jaws apart and tugging his tongue. He's thorough with his examination, from head to toe, inspecting every body part with eccentric glee and mumbling. Of course, in classic Baron style, he ends with Janaz's ass in the air and a palm full of furry balls, rolling them around with a chuckle. It's almost comical how easily he manipulates Janaz- It takes a lot of guts to tug a demon's tail!";

Still taking liberties with his hands, Baron slaps Janaz's back gently with an open palm like a used car salesman. 'Homunculi this advanced require serious power to maintain. Sever that connection, and he'll melt away into goo.' Releasing Janaz's balls, Baron absentmindedly rubs his chin, leaning against a fuzzy side and fixing a jolly grin in your direction. 'Easy enough to fix- Though I'll need some... special ingredients.' Sauntering over to the sales counter, Baron flashes his ass at you as he scribbles a few words on a slip of paper, dipping his claw directly into ink and using it as though it were a pen. He hands it to you shortly after, shooing you toward the door and fixing an oddly predatory expression on Janaz. You get the feeling he'll be extracting a payment while you're gone, and as you peruse the short list, you realize he'll have plenty of time. Two glowferns and a poisonous cloudberry?

It's been quite a while since I've needed more than the most basic spells, and you'd be surprised how many of those are powered exclusively by renewable resources.' Glancing downward, he heavily hints at what he means, practically undressing you with his eyes. 'Though I suppose that the methods haven't changed...

Things are never that easy in this godforsaken city! You'll be lucky if you don't have to climb a tree to gather floating berries shaped like cotton balls. Grumbling to yourself, you finally reach a dark, shaded meadow covered in thick bushes alongside a fallen tree. Thankfully, the cloudberries are more mundane than you expected, though there's one problem. At least 30 different bushes sprawl in front of you, half sporting green and dark purple leaves with red stalks holding mottled raspberry-like fruit and the other half milky white berries and blood-red leaves. There's no way they're the same species, and Baron didn't tell you which one you needed!";

Baron said the berry he's looking for will be poisonous, right? All you have to do is figure out which causes a reaction! The nanites should protect you from any adverse effects. Secure in your logic, you down the handful of milky white berries first, chewing thoughtfully as a strangely floral, acidic flavor caresses your tongue. It's not bad! You might have to return here and get enough to make a pie sometime, if you can remember exactly-";
		say "     Almost as soon as you finish the mouthful, your vision wavers. Strange colors float in from the sides, and when you look down at your outstretched hand, your fingers wave like treetops in the wind, bending impossibly. You try to speak, but no sound comes out, and a loud, intense screech echoes from everywhere around you. Horrified, you scan the trees for danger, only to see gigantic eyes staring back at you from every direction, following your every move as myriad mouths open around them, screaming in unison until the din becomes impossible to ignore, drowning your brain. Overwhelmed by the impossible scene, you collapse, clutching at the sides of your head- horrified to find that it no longer exists. What are you? Who are you? Where are you?! You're floating away on a sea of horrific screams and psychedelic colors, screaming soundlessly for someone, anyone, to help you. Mercifully, everything ceases before you lose your mind.";

Dry lips crack as you lurch to your feet and groan at how heavy your limbs feel, and you wordlessly gather more of the berries that caused your trip, packing them away in a safe place. There's no fucking way you're trying the other variety of berry after the technicolor hell you witnessed, so Baron will just have to make what you gathered work!";

Who knows what eating random berries would do, let alone what 'poisonous' means to the cryptic iguana shaman! For all you know, it's instant death unless handled correctly! Or worse, some gateway into becoming a mindless berry bush! You'll let him decide which one he needs.";

		say "     As soon as you step into the doorway, you're surprised to find a different scene than expected. Usually dominant and requiring quite a bit of coaxing to deviate from beastly mating, Janaz lies pinned on his back, legs splayed and held in place by Baron's grip. Wet, sloppy sounds emanate from their grinding bodies, leaving no doubt about what's happening- though you can still see your feral son's canine cock disappearing between wobbling green cheeks. 'Welcome back!' Baron says with a wave, piledriving the poor fox's captive cock into his greedy hole. 'We grew tired of waiting, so ol' Baron took it upon himself to begin gathering- mmm... The last ingredient.' His lewd behavior at odds with his smooth, though pre-smeared crotch, the genital-less iguana dips lower, biting his lower lip as a wet slap heralds the knot slipping into his well-used hole. 'There it is. Let it all out~.' Closing his eyes for a moment, Baron places a hand on his growing stomach, filled with the demon fox's seed.";
		say "     'Father, I-' Whimpering, Janaz rolls his head backward, his tongue hanging from his mouth, lolling limply. 'May I do this again?' He hisses through clenched teeth as he rolls his hips upward, a goofy expression of pure bliss on his face. 'He's even more talented than you are!' His first experience with someone besides you appears to have gone well, though his words sting a little, causing a small wave of jealousy. You're sure you can take a dick just as well as Baron! You'll have to show him later, after- Fuck. Exasperated as you realize you've gone off track, you palm your forehead, shimmying out of your pack and offering up the ingredients Baron asked for, the small packet of berries and vaguely luminescing ferns with freshly grown roots twisting and writhing as though searching for a new victim. You neglect to mention your trouble with gathering them, wiping dirt off your fingers, and asking if Baron needs anything else to finish the ritual.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Nothing I don't already have on hand!' Baron wiggles his ass, rising with a pleasured look on his face as a wet pop slips Janaz out of him. Gathering a bottle from an unseen corner of his desk, he cradles the tip of your son's cock with it, milking out the last dregs of his orgasm, then bustling around, leaving a trail of dripping mess. At least a dozen different powders and tinctures join the swirling load, coloring it increasingly strange shades until it settles into an electric, vibrantly glowing purple, aided by a quick juicing of the cloudberries and every last frond of both ferns, crushed into a paste. Shaking the concoction and corking it with his finger, Baron froths it until you worry it might explode, drizzling it into two hastily produced wooden cups, offering one to you and the other to Janaz as he sits up and eyes it suspiciously. Licking the leftover potion from his finger, he beams, motioning with one hand for you to down the lot of it. 'All at once. The texture isn't pleasant, but you'll see why you need it soon enough.'";
	else:
		say "     Waiting patiently by the door, you tap your foot, listening to frenzied moans and wild whimpers. It continues for an impressive amount of time, but eventually, you hear the telltale sound of two bodies collapsing to the ground. A few minutes later, you clear your throat, knocking at the doorframe and announcing yourself.You pointedly ignore the fact that Janaz is currently knot-deep in Baron's ass, lying on his back with a blissful expression on his face, shimmying out of your pack and offering up the ingredients Baron asked for, the small packet of berries and vaguely luminescing ferns with freshly grown roots twisting and writhing as though searching for a new victim. You neglect to mention your trouble with gathering them, wiping dirt off your fingers, and asking if Baron needs anything else to finish the ritual.";

With no excuse to chicken out after watching his expression change to disgust and bewilderment, you quickly follow suit, holding back a gag at the objectionably chunky texture. There's no delay between draining the last drop and your vision darkening to an intensely bright tunnel surrounded by pulsating darkness. Impossible colors dance and reach toward you in the inky black, disappearing as soon as they appear, and a dull roar echoes in your ears, growing brighter as you refocus on a shaman's mask floating before you.";
	say "     Baron's voice echoes from the painted wood. 'You'll be passing from the realm. Hold onto your sense of self. Ol' Baron can only do so much.' That echoing, resonant voice is different, possessing a power that seems at odds with his eccentric, oversexed personality but undeniably belongs to the iguana shaman. 'Facing your demons is never easy. I should know.' Suddenly, your vision rushes toward something far in the distance, leaving behind the mystical mask. Fires roar around you, swirling and dancing into demonic, horrific faces, licking at your feet as you walk down a nebulous. Two figures come to life at the end of it, leaping from the flames in the middle of an unfamiliar scene. Janaz cringes at the feet of a hulking familiar figure despite a shrouded face and glowing red eyes. As it turns, you realize it's Kal Ren, raising one paw.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Quickening your pace as that paw comes down, claws extended, you can only watch it make contact with a resounding thud, knocking the feral demon fox from his feet and sending him reeling toward you, lifeless and limp. The wraith smiles, all brimstone and teeth, as it kicks Janaz's body, and an echoing voice fills your ears as it fades, leaving nothing but the faintest glow where its eyes were. 'Have your toy.' Cradling Janaz in your arms, you hold back the panic rising in you. It can't be real. It isn't what you want. Is this all your fault? You can't think- can't speak- what's happening to you? 'The link's severed.' Baron's voice brings you back from your grief, like a warm hand on your shoulder, and the floating shaman's mask appears before you, worn by a ghostly figure you can't quite make out. 'Make him yours before he fades. The terms of the contract are clear.'";
	say "     Before you can question what to do, you see a tendril of glowing, bluish-green light extending from just out of your view, where your chest would be. It quests like a freshly grown root, meandering toward Janaz, then splits, surrounding his body and infusing him with the same light. An impossible-to-describe feeling comes over you as you watch, as though you're in two places at once, and suddenly, the flaming hellscape around you dissolves, leaving you kneeling on the floor of Baron's apothecary next to Janaz's warm, furry side, your face buried in the musky fluff. The iguana beams at you, no trace of the witchy appearance you saw in your vision marring his handsome features, and offers a hand, heaving you to your feet before you can question what just happened. 'All according to plan. Leave here and come back in a few hours. Your boy'll need to sleep it off.' Waving you off, he pushes you outside, then slides a piece of corrugated metal over the doorway, shutting you out. It seems you'll have to wait and see what happens!";
