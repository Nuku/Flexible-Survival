to say SootDesc:
	say "     A single green eye with a slit pupil stares back at you from a mostly bandage-covered face. Tufts of white hair stick haphazardly out of a mess of bandages, framing the predatory orb. Despite the fearsome appearance of that single eye, you can't feel any enmity from its owner, and judging by his relaxed posture, he doesn't mean you any harm. Still, you can't help but feel he's hiding something from you. You can't see much else besides a vaguely masculine, skinny form wrapped in nondescript robes that seem designed to hide Soot's silhouette.";
	if "Half-transformed" is listed in traits of Soot:
		say "    The dragomancer's appearance has changed significantly thanks to your efforts. He stands more proudly, and his once almost useless arm works without issue, though his face is still deformed. You can't help but wonder what he'll look like once you finish your quest to capture and conquer his four dragons.";

to say SootScent:

Perhaps there was a time and place where I might take you up on your offer, but as I am now... It's simply not possible.' Shaking his head, Soot smiles with far too many teeth. 'Though you might channel that energy toward something that pleases us both.' ";

You make it clear that you're only going to participate if you hear the whole story, and if he wants your help, he'll have to make sure that he doesn't hold anything back. You've seen far too many movies and TV shows where this exact situation backfired. 'Hah! Excellent.' Amused by your warning, Soot shakes his head. 'I assure you, I have no ulterior motives. My method may be objectionable to some, but you may find it amenable.' Soot grasps your hand, pressing a yellowed parchment into it. 'First, the method to find the first dragon. Flourish this and say my name, and it will guide you to your quarry.'";

You're not sure that you can drag a dragon through the streets back to this place, let alone fend off other creatures while doing it! 'Not a problem.' The dragomancer painstakingly removes his arm from its bondage at his chest, revealing a draconic limb that shakes with the slightest effort. Slowly, he traces his finger over your palm, drawing a glowing rune with an intricate, almost pulsing design. 'Once you've found the first, press your palm to its scales. My magic will do the rest. I'm afraid I can only weaken it slightly, but it should allow you to defeat it. Once the wyrm falls, I'll bring you both back here.'";

'Hm. Perhaps I see a little of myself in you. Ever curious, exploring the tattered ruins of a destroyed civilization.' Soot leans forward in his seat, taking on a nostalgic look, his hand on his chin. 'And a certain mix of... qualities I require. I've seen what you've gotten up to.' Winking as he makes a hand motion akin to stroking something, the dragomancer heavily implies he's been watching your less-savory interactions. Suddenly bashful, you thank Soot for his honesty.

Drawing another, more intricate series of symbols, he releases it and waves you toward the exit. 'You know what to do! Find him, touch him, and I'll bring him here once you defeat him!'

If you weren't close enough to feel the lack of heat wafting from it, you'd almost think it was on fire! Drawing your attention away from admiring the fancifully flickering door by clearing his throat, Soot beams from behind his desk, magicking a cup of tea from thin air and pressing it into your hand. 'Congratulations! I knew you were the man for the job. A true dragonslayer, the envy of any knight!' Indicating the lively fireworks display roiling on the nearby doorway with his unbandaged hand, Soot continues. 'I've contained your quarry. I can suppress untoward intentions within this place, so don't worry. There's no danger. All he can do is throw his size around for a moment before the wards kick in. Completely harmless.'

Soot nods with a serious expression. 'Well said! It seems we have the same outlook. Though I suppose my intellect is part of why I'm trapped here.' Sighing and shaking his head after a quick rumination, he snatches your palm and draws a quick symbol on your forearm. Within seconds, the symbol begins to sting, then fades.

I suppose that's one way to think of things. I've known many a hero with a similar mindset, so I can't fault it, though I took a markedly different path.' Snatching your hand and dragging it over, the dragomancer draws a quick symbol on your knuckles. Within seconds, the symbol begins to sting, then fades.

	say "     As soon as you return to the pocket Universe, Soot meets you at the door, an eyebrow raised. 'Your... friend... has been asking after you. He seems rather excited to be here. I've never seen a dragon quite this eager for captivity.' Soot waves his hand at your explanation with a knowing grin and shakes his head. 'No, no. I don't need details. It truly doesn't matter HOW you fulfill our bargain. Just let me know if you need any restrictions placed. I'll leave you to it!' Thanking the dragomancer for his discretion, you reiterate that you plan to pump out more eggs for him to use as he sees fit.";

Section 4 - Interactions After Enough Egg Births

to say QuestPartOneDone:
	say "     Feeling a bit of pride at your productive capacity, you tell Soot that you've managed to fulfill quite a quota of dragon eggs so far. Is there much more that you need to do to give him a foothold in your world? Soot shakes his head at your exhuberance, letting out a wry chuckle. 'You've certainly done your part, but you've only finished roughly half of what's needed.' Tugging at the bandage on his arm, he shows off a fully dragconic appendage, free of the twisted appearance you're used to. 'As you can see, it's offered me a sort of stability I haven't seen in years, but I'm not quite finished.' Standing with a bashful smile, the dragomancer's newfound silhouette surprises you. He's much taller, and the robe around his body seems smaller on his frame. Are those claws peeking out under the hem? It seems he's trending more toward dragon features despite the peeking bits of humanity still showing under his bandaged face.";
