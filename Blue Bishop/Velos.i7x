to say ResolveEvent Strange Serpent:
	if HP of Velos is 0 or HP of Velos is 1:
		say "     As you explore the sewers, you're suddenly jolted to attention when you hear something nearby call for your attention.";
		say "     'Psst, over here!' It remarks, compelling you - once it becomes clear there's no immediate danger - to a nearby wall. Dimly lit against a service light, you can see the silhouette of what appears to be some manner of snake. Sickly pale in its complexion and looking to be in the six foot length range, its surface appears slick as it reflects the light, its clear level of mental articulation betraying its otherwise ordinary appearance.";
		if Player is not male_vacant and (insectlarva is false or (insectlarva is true and larvaegg is 2)):
			say "     '...Ah, looking at you clearly now, it's probably be wise to ignore me for now. Come back in a couple of days day or so. You already look like you've got your hands full.' A little confused, he might be referring to your unconventional pregnancy, though how that has anything to do with anything right now is beyond you. Urging you away, you depart, back from whence you came.";
			now HP of Velos is 1;
			now Resolution of Strange Serpent is 1; [talked to Velos, already full]
		else:
			say "     'Right, great, you don't look nearly as mentally deranged as the general fare you see down and about this place - though I suppose I could be wrong...' A little ill at ease with this creature, you greet it before it continues. 'I'm really in need of help here; I'm wholly unequipped to depart from this rather unsettling environment, and I need someone to carry me off.'";
			say "     You're not rightfully sure if you can trust the serpent, but for the sake of argument you infer that you might be up to the task, simple as it seems.";
			say "     'Er, right, there's a catch - and before you roll your eyes and silently pat yourself on the back for your clever assumption, it's not as bad as you think... Depending on how you look at it.' Sighing, you decide to let him continue, for now.";
			say "     'Thank you. Sadly, I can't really expose myself to light for more than a number of minutes at a time; hell, even this dim light here tests me. No, I require a means of... Er... Obfuscation, shall we say?' You're not rightly sure what he's suggesting so you, reasonably enough, ask him to elaborate.";
			if anallevel is 1:
				say "     'Hm... Right...' He seems to stop briefly for a moment. 'There's something about you that suggests I'd get into all sorts of trouble if I beat around the bush with this... Alright, no games, then. I need your ass, in just about the worst way imaginable.'";
				say "     His particular request is clearly incongruous with your general desires. Make him the exception (Y) or rightfully decline (N)?";
			else:
				say "     'Oh, but what would be the fun in that, I really must ask?' He's clearly intent on dancing around the topic, coaxing you to try and get a more appropriate answer. You ask if he means your pack, or under your clothing, 'Oh, something like that wouldn't nearly be as uncomfortable as what I require, but what I require more than that is your consent; I am nothing if not polite.'";
				say "     You're not going to get a straight answer out of this creature, you could agree to his request (Y) or decline it outright (N).";
			if Player consents:
				now lastfuck of Velos is turns;
				say "     Deciding to agree in taking him with you, he seems a little taken off guard by this.";
				say "     'Oh, huh, what a pleasant surprise! Well then, your job is quite simple; could you turn around for me? Yeah, like that, facing the other wall...' A bit unsure of what he exactly plans to do, but you slowly oblige. You're not sure what you're supposed to be waiting for before his plans are made blatantly obvious.";
				say "     Like a bolt of lightning, your struck with the blindingly intense sensation of the serpentine creature worming its way past any attire that might obstruct him, his strangely slicked head driving past your anal ring with surprisingly little resistance, the rest of him soon following";
				If scalevalue of Player < 3:
					say ". Your bowels, on the other hand, are another matter altogether regarding these turn of events. There's quite a lot of him, especially when you consider your diminutive size, and your belly bloats almost immediately to abide his slippery frame.";
					if insectlarva is true:
						say "     Even as you fully engulf the serpent, his endeavors fail to relent, as it's made apparent that some manner of conflict is waged within you. Soon, you're wracked with the sensation of another mass passing through your anal ring, soon made apparent to be your previous parasite, who - after leaving your body - is relegated to rolling around in a confused daze before retreating from the sewers. It is a pale creature, looking much like a bloated, insect larva with several tiny legs and phallic back end[if larvaegg is 1]. Its expulsion if followed by that of the unfertilized insect eggs[end if]. You'd imagine that its kin will find and retrieve the thing, no doubt to be inflicted upon another.";
						say "     Your new resident would only revel in this now-liberated dwelling briefly before you can see the outline of his head emerge from your hole, exposing him just enough to continue the dialogue.";
					else:
						say "     Driven to your knees by this wracking sensation, its raising intensity inevitably relents when he's forcibly trapped the whole of himself inside you. You can barely contain all of him, distended torso strained under such a considerable holding. In due time, you can compel yourself to your feet, your infection twisting these circumstances in such a way that you can move reasonably in spite these circumstances.";
						say "     Bulge twitching as you must content with his irreverent movements, you're forced to elicit a weakened moan as you feel his head retreat from the hole it once invaded, pulling just enough of itself out that you might see himself before you.";
					say "     'Quite the tight fit, if I do say so myself! But I like to think that cozy is often an attribute falsely regarded as poor.' He seems rather pleased with himself, try pulling him out?";
				else if scalevalue of Player > 3:
					say ". Struck with twisted pleasure as his form floods your bowels, and though you're more than large enough to handle him that doesn't quite change the fact that he's got a fair amount of himself to put into you, forcing you onto your knees and, inevitably, to roll over onto your back.";

					say "     'Oh, quite the roomy fare, I'm surprised if I even phase you in the slightest! I certainly hope I don't get lost in here...' He seems rather pleased with himself, try pulling him out?";
				else:
					say ". Taken aback by these sudden turn of events, you can find that you can tolerate him flooding your bowels only momentarily. There's quite a lot of him, and you're forced to watch as your belly bloats further and further to abide his slippery frame.";

His increasingly troubled expression seems to infer that he's on the cusp of an existential breakdown before he yells out in blind rage, charging the wall once more, so hard that he bounces back a few feet and falls right over. Possibly blacking out for a few seconds, he eventually does crawl back up on his feet, before looking at Velos with abject confusion.";

	say "     'I'd humor you, but I'm struck with a moment's confusion. Aren't you cold?'";
	say "     'W-What?' His subsequent query seems more elicited by the apparent confusion towards the serpent's apparent capacity for speech than his actual query.";

	say "     'It's a humid heat. How wouldn't you know this?'";

	say "     'I mean, seriously.'";
	say "     'Trust me when I recommend you take the silly answer instead.' His otherwise cordial demeanor shifts slightly into something more serious, an illustration showing that he means what he says, and a gesture Onyx picks up on. 'You'll have to forgive me, but this is where I have to depart.'";
	say "     'Whew...' the equine breaths a sigh of relief once the serpent has returned to its confines within you. 'I'm sure has hell glad I don't go out there nearly as much as you do.' Acknowledging his parting words, you let him off to his own matters for now.";

	say "     'Heavens! I generally don't care to have people show me their snake, but this is just ridiculous.'";
	say "     'Hey, only I get to make the jokes around here!' The serpent feigns anger in the wake of Boris's attempt at humor.";
	say "     'Sorry. I wish I could say that you're the weirdest thing I've seen happen around here, but I've not been so lucky.'";
	say "     'Right. No doubt you're stuck in that attire?'";
	say "     'Stuck in the same way you're stuck in your own skin.'";

	say "     'Well, staying here can't be any good for you.'";
	say "     'I don't know. Sometimes I try to leave, but then my mind starts to wander and back here I am.' Boris shrugs, a little dismissively. 'What's your excuse?'";
	say "     'I don't do outside too well, let's keep it at that.'";
	say "     'Alright. Anyways, I might be able to do some help by warding people off from this place.'";

	say "     'Arthur the Antelope! I bet he's plotting his next scheme right now, but what could it be...?'";

	say "     'What, huh? Oh, er... Sorry, sometimes I go off track like that.' Boris does seem a little embarrassed, to which Velos rolls his eyes in response.";
	say "     'Right. In any case, I'm afraid I have to depart. Try to keep your head together.'";
	say "     'Yeah...' The mascot returns to where he was standing, lost in thought. With a sigh, Velos retreats back within your depths, leaving you to go on your way.";


Part 23 - Anastasia

the vmusings of Anastasia is "[Anastasiamusing]";

to say Anastasiamusing:
	say "     'Where have you brought me? This place is sweltering! Is... Is that lava? Why are we even here?' Velos's line of enquiry elicited by his summoning, he seems a little more distressed by the apparent scenery and is doubtlessly a bit surprised when Anastasia approaches.";
	say "     'Hello... What strange creature have you brought here?'";
	say "     'Ah, that would explain it, and I could easily reflect that question back at you, bird who also appears to be on fire.'";
	say "     'You are one of few manners. I can tell.'";
	say "     'You'll have to forgive me, then, the heat has me a bit at odds right now.'";
	say "     'Would a snake not prefer the heat?'";
	say "     'If my current residence is to be any indication, I'd rather avoid this sort of exposure.'";
	say "     'But your home - twisted though it is - must be warmer than the outside.'";
	say "     'Your assessment, while reasonably astute, lacks perspective; you're ultimately trying to draw a similarity between body temperature and molten rock.'";
	say "     'My apologies, I am not quite as troubled by the heat as others would be.'";
	say "     'Without a doubt. Admittedly, I don't get out much, but I don't think I've ever seen or heard of an infected like yourself before.'";
	say "     'What makes you assume that I am such?'";
	say "     'Well, granted, it's generally safe to assume that a more feral creature would be less articulated than what you are, but how else would you be that way?'";
	say "     'We all have our secrets. A serpent like yourself can appreciate that sentiment.' The avian seems to shift to a slight defensive stance, perhaps inferring that this is a subject that could be pressed against her, but Velos seems to not pursue it.";
	say "     'Very well. I think we'll cut this short - this place puts an even larger strain on me than usual. Take care.' Ending his discussion on a more polite note, Anastasia seems to calm a bit down as he retreats back into your hole, leaving you to your own matters.";


Part 23 - Dr Matt

the vmusings of Doctor Matt is "[drmattmusing]";

to say drmattmusing:
	say "     'You wanted to show me something?' Doctor Matt queries you as you approach, somewhat sheepishly summoning Velos from his hiding place. Matt is, undoubtedly, a little off put by that. 'How unpleasant...'";
	say "     'Yeah, I'd say the same thing if I was you and I just saw my face's reflection from inside that suit.' The serpent doesn't seem to take the doctor's regard all that well.";
	say "     'And it talks, huh.' He quickly grabs a swab and rubs it against the snake, damping it with his slick lubricant, much to his apparent discomfort. He takes the swab and starts to examine it. 'Well, that's odd. He's not infectious, by the looks of it.'";
	say "     'Why would I ever want more of me around?'";
	say "     'It's rarely ever that simple.'";
	say "     'I don't know, if I turned my friend into me that'd make my occupancy rather ill-fitting...[run paragraph on][if scalevalue of Player < 3] I mean, more than it already is now.[end if]'";
	say "     'Could you say [']Aaah['] for me?'";
	say "     'Say wha- ghft!' Velos is interrupted as the scientist assails the serpent with another swab, this time for his saliva, before retreating and looking into it as well, much to the snake's apparent disdain.";
	say "     'Fascinating...'";
	say "     'I seriously doubt I'm going to get much in terms of scintillating dialogue from you, now am I?'";
	say "     'Now, could you stay very still? I'm going to bombard you with a stream of microwaves here. Shouldn't hurt a bit.'";
	say "     'Nope; no. I'm gone. It's been fun, bye!' He, rather urgently, retreats back from whence he came, much to your fidgeting discontent given the fervor at which he does this. Matt seems a little disappointed by this, but inevitably concedes to leaving you to your own matters once more.";
