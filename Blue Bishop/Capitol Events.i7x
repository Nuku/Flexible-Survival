	say "     They appear to just be standing there, one drake flanked by a pair of dragators, their intent soon made somewhat clear when a new party - a set of dark elves - calmly advance upon them. You imagine this would be rather odd for the two to meet in this manner, and it's clear that they share this sentiment as they look none too fond of this arrangement.";
	say "     Too far to hear what they actually say, they seem to be arguing over something, tossing accusations left and right and not really coming to any agreement. It would appear that tension is running high enough that they might turn on each other before they're interrupted when a sound from the open area, opposite to you, draws their attention.";
