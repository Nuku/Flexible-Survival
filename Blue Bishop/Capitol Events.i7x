It's suddenly made abundantly clear that you've stumbled upon some ashen nest, a number of eggs strewn across the once-basement.  Thankfully, the eggs['] owners are elsewhere right now, but a handful of their kin are none-too-happy to be roused from their slumber after your clumsy entrance, already moving to attack you.";
				say "[ashengauntlet]";
			Otherwise:
				now hp of player is 1;
				say ".  The impact is strong enough to render you unconscious, the chittering sound of ashen whelps the only thing you can recall before you black out.";
				say "     Your consciousness is roused once again by strained squeals and yipping of your apparent assailants.  The writhing, heated flesh of a few whelps on you, more strewn about, rather exhausted themselves.  As you shift, it immediately becomes clear that you're partially doused with the creatures' glowing seed, [if scalevalue of player > 3]an impressive feat for someone as large as you.  These whelps have been very busy, that or you've been out for quite some time[otherwise]the whelps clearly having been fairly busy with you, that or you've been out for a couple hours[end if].";
				say "     Though you still feel a couple heaving against your [if scalevalue of player > 3]large[end if] behind, it's clear they're all too spent to fight you.  Embarrassed as you are, you easily shove them off, weakly pulling yourself back up the hole.  As you crawl back from whence you came, it's clear by the twisted aftertaste in your mouth, the small creatures made the most of what they could against your helpless form.[impregchance][mimpregchance]";

Engulfed in numerous masses of twisted, ashen scales, the chirping, chittering noises they emit are almost unbearable[if player is submissive].  You are too overwhelmed by your submissive inclinations to resist their wanton, fiery desire[otherwise if hp of player > 0].  Their wanton, fiery desire is too overwhelming for you to resist[otherwise].  Your impotent attempts at pushing them away are too inadequate to dissuade their wanton, fiery desire[end if].";

A handful of heated, sweat-laden minutes pass before feel one cry out in blissful release, its kin soon following suit.";
			say "     You are quick to assume that they are finished with their fun, but it's clear that, since you came down on -their- home, they have nowhere else to be, and they thusly continue to use you, new ones falling in place when one becomes too exhausted, until what seems like an eternity before they're all too exhausted and [if hp of player > 0 or player is submissive]they have nothing left to offer you[otherwise]you've recovered enough to push them off[end if].  Exhausted, mostly covered in sexual fluids, and quite embarrassed with yourself, you pull yourself out of the hole and back from whence you came before their parents might return.[mimpregchance][impregchance]";

Strange Meeting is a situation.
The sarea of Strange Meeting is "Capitol".

Instead of resolving Strange Meeting:
	say "     Travelling through the ruined area, you happen upon what appears to be a set of Ashen Dragonkin in the distance.  Thankfully not being spotted, you duck behind some rubble, watching what they do.";
	say "     They appear to just be standing there, one Drakenoid flanked by a pair of Dragators, their intent soon made somewhat clear when a new party--a set of Dark Elves--calmly advance upon them.  You imagine this would be rather odd for the two to meet in this manner, and it's clear that they share this sentiment as they look none too fond of this arrangement.";
	say "     Too far to hear what they actually say, they seem to be arguing over something, tossing accusations left and right and not really coming to any agreement.  It would appear that tension is running high enough that they might turn on each other before they're interrupted when a sound from the open area, opposite to you, draws their attention.";
	say "     You're not exactly sure what has them so ill at ease, both parties conceding into retreating.  Chances are, you don't want to stay and find out, and thusly you move to depart yourself.";

Section 4 - Failed Escape

Failed Escape is a situation.
The sarea of Failed Escape is "Capitol".

Instead of resolving Failed Escape:
	say "     You encounter what appears to be a crashed military helicopter.  Its equipment is completely roasted and its once-occupants are nowhere to be found.  Upon closer inspection, there appears to be the stains of some sexual fluids, long sinced dried and caked on the charred surfaces, perhaps inferring the fate of those who tried to escape on this.";
	now Failed Escape is resolved;


Section 5 - Charred Pickets

Charred Pickets is a situation.
The sarea of Charred Pickets is "Capitol".

Instead of resolving Charred Pickets:
	say "     You manage to find some peculiar picket signs strewn about a small area, too burnt up to make out what they might have been for.  You imagine that the people carrying these signs were rudely interrupted in the middle of their protest.";
	now charred pickets is resolved;
