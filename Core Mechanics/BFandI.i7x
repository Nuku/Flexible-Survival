Version 4 of BFandI by Core Mechanics begins here.
[version 4 - Flag and Marker listing added]
[- Originally Authored By: Stripes -]

"Creates the 'Brute Force and Ignorance' debugging commands to forcibly check on various data in the game. This document also contains various data on the new player variables created to go with these and what the use and possible applications of the new column entries can include.";

[ BFandI command list:
bfandi (or bfandi1) checks the various new column entries for critters on the Table of Random Critters.
bfandi2 lists all existing creatures in the monster table and displays whether they have an altcombat entry, showing that entry if it exists.
bfandi3 lists all situations in the current area, whether they're resolved or unresolved and it's level. It will also mention if it's a scavevent.
bfandi4 lists all situations sorted by area, level or name, as selected once run, then provides data similar to bfandi3.
bfandi5 lists all flags and markers, counting their individual totals and displaying their contents.

Section 13 - Brute Force Creature Testing (BFandI command) - Not for release

[For testing purposes - scans and examines the new table entries for a creature.]

[ NOTE: Until all creatures have these variables, it is important to use clauses which begin by checking if that entry exists. As well, the 'nocturnal entry' will most often be left blank and that is a valid result meaning both day and night.]

[Description of new player attribute variables]

[ SCALEVALUE: records the 'scale entry' during infection.
This should be set whenever a player's body is changed. It gives a general scale to a person's height and can be used for:
- checking if a player can fit through small spaces.
- making size comparisons between the player and monsters/NPCs.
- making choices or for altering sex scenes based on character position.
- affecting NPC/monster reactions: may find small players cute, big players scary, may not respect small players, etc...
- could be given to an NPC who could be given different infections, allowing more customization of scenes.
- affects the 'body size of player' variable statement, which can be used in descriptive scenes. 1 -> tiny, 2 -> small, 3 -> average, 4 -> large, 5 -> huge.
- For the moment, it should not be adjusted by external factors, locked and so forth, as many infection descriptions talk about the infected player's body size, height, etc... already and this would generate conflicts. Making this more adjustable could be a long term goal, but not at present. ]

[ BODYDESC: records the 'body descriptor entry' during infection.
This should be set whenever a player's body is changed. It gives an adjective to describe the player's body. Use 'if...' or 'one of...' to provide more variation, but it should always be a single word dealing with the player's body description. Ex: muscled, fat, plump, chubby, slender, bony, twisted, deformed, pot-bellied, etc... It can be used for more descriptive and reactive scenes with NPCs and monsters. Expect it to be used in sentences such as: Your lover runs its paws over your [bodydesc of player] body as they moan in delight. ]

[ BODYTYPE: records the 'type entry' during infection.
This should be set whenever a player's body is changed. It is an adjective to describe the basic creature type the player's body represents. Ex: human, feline, canine, ursine, bovine, insectoid, mustelid, robot, mutant, cyborg, humanoid, demi-human, etc... Expect it to be used in sentences such as: The lusty creature runs his paws over your [bodytype of player] body, looking over its prize. ]

[ DAYCYCLE: records the 'nocturnal' entry as a number: 0 for no entry, 1 for false and 2 for true. This may see future use to designate if a player has any hindrances during the day/night or to otherwise indicate how they feel about their activity level during those times of the day. As the infection/body change scenes will all be getting the update to store the other data, this one may as well be made in advance. ]

[-----------------------------------------------------------------------]

[Description of the new entries in the Table of Random Critters:]

[ SCALE: A number between 1 and 5 to designate the scale of someone with this infection (from 1=tiny to 5=huge). It should saved as the 'scalevalue of player' during body infection. [scalevalue of player] or [body size of player] can be used to better personalize scenes with monsters/NPCs to a player's size. If other (variable infection) NPCs are given this attribute, it can be saved on them as well, allowing for more descriptive scenes.
If this entry is not set on a creature, the game will default to '3', which is 'average'.]

[ BODY DESCRIPTOR: A one-word adjective to describe the build or other qualities of the body bestowed by this infection. It should be saved as 'bodydesc of player' during body infection. If other (variable infection) NPCs are given this attribute, it can be saved on them as well, allowing for more descriptive scenes. Examples include: fat, muscled, fit, burly, chubby, hump-backed, pot-bellied, slender, bony, twisted, deformed, etc... Again, this should be just one-word, adjective entries, but use of [one of]fat[or]chubby[or]plump[at random] is perfectly acceptable. If-conditions are trickier, as they'll work fine for the player, but won't if transferred onto an NPC.
These will be used to describe the player during scenes and should be a single adjective to best fit all scenarios. If the body descriptor entry is not set, the game will default to saving the name entry in its place as a substitute. ]

[ TYPE: A one-word adjective to generally designate the type of creature this is and this infection bestows. It should be saved as 'bodytype of player' during body infection. If other (variable infection) NPCs are given this attribute, it can be saved on them as well, allowing for more descriptive scenes. Examples include: human, human-like, feline, canine, vulpine, lupine, robotic, cyborg, human, humanoid, demi-human, dwarven, simian, etc... Again, this should be just one word, adjective entries, but use of [one of]equine[or]horse-like[at random] to create greater diversity is fine. If-conditions are trickier, as they'll work fine for the player, but won't if transferred onto an NPC.
These will be used to describe the player during scenes and should be a single adjective to best fit all scenarios. If the type entry is not set, the game will detault to saving the name entry in its place as a substitute. ]

[ MAGIC: A truth state to designate whether this creature is a magical-type creature or not. No immediate plans for use, but may be use later. An unset creature is treated as non-magical. ]

[ RESBYPASS: A truth state to designate whether this creature's infection can bypass a researcher's resistance to infection. This should be ultra-rare and should have a good reason for occurring, such as a non-nanite based infection. An unset creature is treated as not bypassing the resistance. ]

[ NON-INFECTIOUS: A truth state to designate whether this creature cannot cause infection. It can eventually be used for non-infectious creatures such as soldier enemies, military robots, etc... and a few critters. The shifting ability should not be able to gain these infections, nor should any source of random infection. ]

[ DAYRHTHM: 0 = up at all times, 1 = nocturnal, 2 = diurnal ]

[ ALTCOMBAT: An entry to detect whether the creature has any special behavior during combat. See the 'Alt Combat' document for the updated combat system. An unset creature is treated as using the 'default' combat system. ]
