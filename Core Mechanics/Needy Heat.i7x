Version 3 of Needy Heat by Core Mechanics begins here.

[- Originally Authored By: Telanda Softpaw -]

"Addon for adding an 'in heat' Event to infections, designed to work with all monster type infections by default, with the option to be customizable if you want to add specifics for your monster."

Book 1 - Variables

heat enabled is a truth state that varies. heat enabled is usually True. [This variable turns the heat mod on an off.]
animal heat is a truth state that varies. animal heat is usually False. [This variable is used to check to see if you've started an animalistic breeding cycle.]
turns in heat is a number that varies. turns in heat is usually 0. [Counter to say how long you've been in heat.]
inheat is a truth state that varies. inheat is usually False. [Variable for other mods to easily check if you are in heat right now.]
slutfucked is a number that varies. slutfucked is usually 0. [Variable to prevent too many random husky encounters.]
lastturn is a number that varies. lastturn is usually 240. [This is used so that we only trigger events once per GAME turn (3 hr period) rather than each event turn.]
heatform is a number that varies. [This is used to denote whether the player's last turn was spent in female heat or mpreg heat]
heatlevel is a number that varies. heatlevel is usually 2. [This is used to denote the intensity of Player heat (1=off / 2=normal / 3=intense)]
heatdrive is a number that varies. heatdrive is usually 0. [heatdrive controls how outside events drive a player's heat (0=combat, 1=regular play)]

"Husky Bitch"	400	400	"A sharp strike of pain in your lower belly makes you clutch at it and drop to your knees with a gasp. As you struggle for breath through the fading pain, you can feel a hot trickle from between your legs. Looking down you watch in horrified fascination as your sex twists and warps into that of a bitch's, then begins to swell and puff up rapidly. Your dripping nethers throb with the fertility and lust of canine heat."

Book 3 - Debugging Commands - not for release

showheat is an action applying to nothing.
understand "show heat" as showheat.

carry out showheat:
	say "You've been vulnerable to animal heat for [turns in heat] Turns.";

setheat is an action applying to one number.
understand "set heat [a number]" as setheat.

carry out setheat:
	now turns in heat is the number understood;
	say "turns in heat set to [turns in heat].";
