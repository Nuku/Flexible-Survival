Section 5 - Critter Combat

Chapter 0 - Definition of entries

[ DEFINITIONS OF ENTRIES:
name:			The name of the rule. Must be matched exactly by the altcombat entry of the critter.
combat:		This is the basic rule to be followed when a monster counter-attacks, preceded only by the continuous entry and _replacing_ the
			standard retaliation rule entirely. There should always be a rule in this field.
preattack:		This rule is followed at the very start of the 'to retaliate' feature, but can be called by other combat rules as well. It is meant
			for effects that take place before a normal attack and occurs _before_ a player's avoidance check.
postattack:		This rule is followed at the very end of the 'to retaliate' feature, but again can be called by other combat rules as well. It is
			meant for effects that take place after a normal attack. This could be as simple as bragging, to poisoning a player (to be managed
			by the playerpoisoned rule) and so on.
altattack1:		This is an alternate, dexterity-based attack the creature will sometimes use. These can be attacks w/effects, different damage,
			armor piercing, etc...
alt1chance:		The likelihood the first alternate attack will be chosen.
altattack2:		This is another alternate, dexterity-based attack the creature will sometimes use.
alt2chance:		The likelihood the second alternate attack will be chosen (if the first is not). If neither alternate occurs, it defaults to normal
			methodology.
monmiss:		This rule replaces the regular miss statement and may contain necessary code for counting/resetting/etc...
continuous:		This rule takes place before any and all combat rules. It is much like the pre-attack, but happens regardless of the attack method
			being used. Good for enemy regen, player HP drain, player libido boosting, etc... that happens every turn.
altstrike:		This rule replaces the standard dexterity to-hit attempt by the monster (ex: using Int, Char, etc...)

While most anything can be created by placing it all in the combat rule, that requires duplication of all the code whereas using the subsets would save a lot of hassle and would ensure basic combat adaptations could more accurately be carried over (new player feats relating to defense, for example). As well, with the rules broken out, they can more easily be repeated in the table in other combinations. The 'retaliation rule' is the standard combat option, designed to call all the others at the appropriate time, except for the continuous entry (which is run independently before any combat rule). A combat rule may branch between picking to do the 'retaliate' action as normal or doing something special instead (like a non-dexterity attack).

As they are all rules, they need not be restricted for one creature. Several creatures could use the same 'bearhug rule' with their own stats in effect.

A note on alternate attacks: This is the 'damage' portion of a dexterity strike replaced. If you need non-dexterity attacks, go to the combat entry/altstrike entry. If you need more than 2 alternate attacks, you can break them up as sub-selections of alt1 and alt2 or just make a combat entry for it all and be done with it.

Part 3 - Post-Attack Example - Brag

this is the brag rule:
	choose row monster from table of random critters;
	say "[one of]'Woo! Take that!' [or]'Aww yeah!' [or]'Like a boss, baby!' [or]'Po feels embarrassed for you,' [at random][one of]your enemy chuckles[or]your opponent gloats[or]the [name entry] laughs derisively[at random].";

Part 4 - Pre/Post/Miss Combo Example - Power Strike 1

[Any creature that undergoes stat shifts needs to reset either during its description before each fight or (if possible) before that fight ends, like this. Trying to reset them within the win/lose scenes is not recommended, as the use of 'Control Freak' feat will cause them to be skipped.
Warning: if an alternate attack before this one could break the fight and somehow prevent the postattack entry from running, you must provide a reset there as well. It's best to have this reset in the description to cover all your bases.]

this is the ps1charge rule:
	choose row monster from table of random critters;

Part 8 - Alternate Combat Example - Fire Breath

firebreathcount is a number that varies.
