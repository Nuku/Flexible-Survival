Part 4 - Actions

[This is generally not used and bypassed by an "instead of conversing" - talk menus are more useful]
understand "talk [person]" as conversing.
understand "talk to [person]" as conversing.
understand "chat [person]" as conversing.

	sort conversation of the noun in random order;
	repeat with comment running through conversation of the noun:
		say "[Noun] says, '[Comment]'";
