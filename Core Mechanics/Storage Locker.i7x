Section 1 - Storage Locker Setup

There is a storage locker in Bunker. It is fixed in place. It has a description "[stlockerdesc]".
understand "use [storage locker]" as examining.

instead of examining the storage locker, say stlockerdesc.

to say stlockerdesc:
	say "     There are several storage lockers built into the bunker. They may have once held supplies or necessary equipment, but that all seems to be long gone. Still, they'll make for handy storage that you and any other occupants can use. There's plenty of space, so you should be able to [bold type]stash[roman type] as much as you like so you can [bold type]retrieve[roman type] it later.";
	say "[bold type]Options:[roman type][line break]";
	say "[link](1) Display player inventory[as]1[end link][line break]";
	say "[link](2) Display storage inventory[as]2[end link][line break]";
	say "[link](3) Stash everything[as]3[end link][line break]";
	say "[link](4) Retrieve everything[as]4[end link][line break]";
	say "[link](5) Command list[as]5[end link][line break]";
	say "[link](0) Exit[as]0[end link][line break]";
	while 1 is 1:
		say "Choice? (0-5)> [run paragraph on]";
		get a number;
		if calcnumber >= 0 and calcnumber <= 5:
			break;
		else:
			say "Invalid choice. Pick from 0 to 5.";
	if calcnumber is 1:
		displayplinv;
	else if calcnumber is 2:
		displaystorage;
	else if calcnumber is 3:
		try massstashing;
	else if calcnumber is 4:
		try massretrieving;
	else if calcnumber is 5:
		say "[stlockercom]";
	else:
		say "You close the storage locker.";


instead of using storage locker:
	say "[stlockerdesc]";

instead of opening storage locker:
	say "[stlockerdesc]";


Section 2 - Displaying Contents

to displayplinv:
	say "[bold type]Player inventory contents:[roman type][line break]";
	if invcolumns < 1 or invcolumns > 4, now invcolumns is 2;
	if the number of owned grab objects is 0:
		say "There is nothing currently in your inventory.";
	else:
		[say "[bold type][bracket]S[close bracket][roman type]tash 1 or Stash [bold type][bracket]A[close bracket][roman type]ll";]
		let y be 0;
		repeat with x running through all owned grab objects:
			increase y by 1;
			say "[x] = [carried of x] [link][bracket]S[close bracket][as]stash [x][end link]  [link][bracket]A[close bracket][as]stashall [x][end link][roman type]";
			if the remainder after dividing y by invcolumns is 0:
				LineBreak;
			else:
				say " || ";
			if y is 12 * invcolumns:
				now y is 0;
				LineBreak;
				wait for any key;
		LineBreak;


to displaystorage:
	say "[bold type]Storage locker contents:[roman type][line break]";
	if invcolumns < 1 or invcolumns > 4, now invcolumns is 2;
	if the number of stored grab objects is 0:
		say "There is nothing currently in the storage locker.";
	else:
		[say "[bold type][bracket]R[close bracket][roman type]etrieve 1 or Retrieve [bold type][bracket]A[close bracket][roman type]ll";]
		let y be 0;
		repeat with x running through all stored grab objects:
			increase y by 1;
			say "[x] = [stashed of x] [link][bracket]R[close bracket][as]retrieve [x][end link]  [link][bracket]A[close bracket][as]retrieveall [x][end link][roman type]";
			if the remainder after dividing y by invcolumns is 0:
				LineBreak;
			else:
				say "  ||  ";
			if y is 12 * invcolumns:
				now y is 0;
				LineBreak;
				wait for any key;
		LineBreak;


Section 3 - Commands

to say stlockercom:
	say "There are several commands you can use with the storage locker to manipulate objects between it and your inventory.";
	say "[bold type]stash <object>[roman type] - Place one of the named object in the locker.";
	say "[bold type]stashall <object>[roman type] - Place all copies of the named object in the locker.";
	say "[bold type]massstash[roman type] - Place everything you have (except journal and equipped gear) in the storage locker.";
	say "[bold type]retrieve <object>[roman type] - Take one of the named object from the locker.";
	say "[bold type]retrieveall <object>[roman type] - Take all copies of the named object from the locker.";
	say "[bold type]massretrieve[roman type] - Take everything from the locker.";


Stashing is an action applying to one thing.
Retrieving is an action applying to one thing.
Allstashing is an action applying to one thing.
Allretrieving is an action applying to one thing.
Massstashing is an action applying to nothing.
Massretrieving is an action applying to nothing.

understand "stash [grab object]" as stashing.
understand "stashall [grab object]" as allstashing.
understand "massstash" as massstashing.
understand "retrieve [grab object]" as retrieving.
understand "retrieveall [grab object]" as allretrieving.
understand "massretrieve" as massretrieving.

Check stashing a grab object (called x):
	if storage locker is not visible, say "Stash it where?" instead;
	if carried of x <= 0, say "You don't seem to have any [x] on you right now." instead;
	if x is journal, say "You'd best hang onto that." instead;
	if x is wielded, say "You're using that right now." instead;
	if x is equipped, say "You're using that right now." instead;

Carry out stashing a grab object (called x):
	ItemLoss x by 1 silently;
	increase stashed of x by 1;
	say "You put a [x] into the locker for storage.";

Check retrieving a grab object (called x):
	if storage locker is not visible, say "Retrieve from where?" instead;
	if stashed of x <= 0, say "There doesn't seem to have any [x] in the storage locker right now." instead;

Carry out retrieving a grab object (called x):
	decrease stashed of x by 1;
	ItemGain x by 1 silently;
	say "You take a [x] from the storage locker.";


Check allstashing a grab object (called x):
	if storage locker is not visible, say "Stash them where?" instead;
	if carried of x <= 0, say "You don't seem to have any [x] on you right now." instead;
	if x is journal, say "You'd best hang onto that." instead;
	if x is wielded, say "You're using that right now." instead;
	if x is equipped, say "You're using that right now." instead;

Carry out allstashing a grab object (called x):
	let num be carried of x;
	increase stashed of x by num;
	ItemLoss all x silently;
	say "You put [num] of [x] into the locker for storage.";

Check allretrieving a grab object (called x):
	if storage locker is not visible, say "Stash them where?" instead;
	if stashed of x <= 0, say "There doesn't seem to have any [x] in the storage locker right now" instead;

Carry out allretrieving a grab object (called x):
	let num be stashed of x;
	ItemGain x by num silently;
	now stashed of x is 0;
	say "You take [num] of [x] from the storage locker.";

Check massstashing:
	if storage locker is not visible, say "Stash them where?" instead;

Carry out massstashing:
	let yy be 0;
	let zz be 0;
	repeat with x running through all owned grab objects:
		if x is journal or x is equipped or x is wielded:
			next;
		else:
			increase yy by 1;
			increase zz by carried of x;
			ItemLoss x by carried of x silently;
			increase stashed of x by carried of x;
	if zz is 0:
		say "You have nothing you can store.";
	else:
		say "You stash [zz] things ([yy] different objects) in the storage locker.";

check massretrieving:
	if storage locker is not visible, say "Stash them where?" instead;

carry out massretrieving:
	let yy be 0;
	let zz be 0;
	repeat with x running through all stored grab objects:
		increase yy by 1;
		increase zz by stashed of x;
		ItemGain x by stashed of x silently;
		[
		increase carried of x by stashed of x;
		]
		now stashed of x is 0;
	if zz is 0:
		say "The storage locker is already empty.";
	else:
