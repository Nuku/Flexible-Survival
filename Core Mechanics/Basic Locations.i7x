It opens up freely as you push the dimly glowing button, revealing a generous cabin, complete with a control panel that only has one button, for the lobby. Everything else is keyholes, four to each floor. Someone sure liked their privacy. Checking the interior stairway access door right next to it, you find it jammed; a glance through its little window reveals that about twenty feet of the stairway are completely barricaded by mixed pieces of furniture. Four doorways lead off into what must be the ground floor apartments - 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D. [if HP of Otto < 4]The first two and the last all have been nailed shut and the words 'Carnivorous Furniture' spray-painted on them[else]1A and 1D have been nailed shut and the words 'Closed for Repair' carefully stencilled onto signs hanging from their doorknobs[end if], while the door of apartment 1C is just leaned to[if HP of Otto > 3].

The fact that the building has fairly large glass doors on two sides seems to have worked against the inhabitants, making them easily visible for passing predators. Several of the doors are marked with claw-slashes and half-torn out of their frames, while others show more calculated destruction. There must have been a crowbar at work for those, likely from looters going for a quick smash and grab. A stairway allows access to the next floor [Bold Type]up[roman type].";

The front section appears to be mostly decorative, while further back, there are a number of fruit-bearing plants, surprisingly still with their rich bounty attached. Yet the temptation to go help yourself to some is quickly suppressed as you notice that at least one large, spindly plant is actually a monstrously large stick insect, standing perfectly motionless among the greenery with raised striking claws. It doesn't react in any way to your presence, or being spoken to. The doors of apartments all around you appear untouched, and a stairway leads [Bold Type]down[roman type] to the next lower floor.

You don't see any kind of military cordon here, making you suspect those already infected have spread out here before the military was mobilized to close it off. Smoke rising far in the northwest makes you guess that their lines are probably there, at the chokepoint between the mountain and the expansive Pacifica Nature Preserve. Some hoof prints you spot in a sandy patch nearby furthers the assumption that it is no longer human civilization that rules here. As for the open grasslands, it looks like the something leveled just about all of the scattered buildings further out. Now all that is left of them among the dirt and grassland are mounds of rubble. The plains are dry and brown with only a few trees or bushes scattered across the rolling plains before you.".
