"Getting Started"	"Welcome to Flexible Survival! To get started with playing there are a few commands you need to know.[line break]In order to move around, you can use the compass directions (north, south, east, west, etc.), move 'in' and 'out' of buildings, and 'nav' or 'navigate' between areas.[line break]You can 'explore' the world to find events, monsters, and new areas, or 'hunt' for something specific.[line break]To interact with things around you, you can 'look', 'get', 'smell', 'fuck', 'talk' to, or 'drop' items. If you do pick things up, you can access your inventory with 'inv'.[line break]If you find yourself running low on food or water, you may need to 'scavenge' around the city."
"Hunting"	"You can hunt for specific creatures. Go to a place you can explore from, like the library.[line break]You there? Ok, now type [bold type]hunt (creature)[roman type].[line break]You are not assured success, but a critter is 3 times more likely to show up when actively looked for.[line break]You can also hunt for locations, if you know their name.[line break]Hunting for something doesn't require that you use the entire name, and can sometimes have multiple results, for example 'hunt dragon' in the park would hunt for both yamato dragon and yamato dragoness, but 'hunt dragoness' would only hunt for the yamato dragoness."
"Trading"	"You can trade with certain denizens of the city. Simply [bold type]give x to y[roman type], like give soda to Bob. If they want it, they'll give you something back for it. Trades are final, but usually worth it."
"Scoring"	"Staying alive, making friends, and unearthing the mysteries of the city get you points. Losing battles saps points. See how high a score you can manage!"
"Items"	"You will come to have a variety of items. Here are some useful commands.[line break][line break]item: See a list of items you own.[line break]look (item): Look at a specific item.[line break]use (item): Use an item[line break]get (item): Grab a specific item.[line break]get all: Get everything in the room.[line break]junk (item): Destroy an item forever.[line break]drop (item): Drop the item on the floor, so you can pick it up later."
"Weapons"	"Some items you find make good weapons! Be sure to [bold type]use (weapon)[roman type] before a battle to have them at hand."
"Graphics"	"Graphics can be enabled or disabled by typing [bold type]graphics[roman type]."
"Scavenging"	"Type [bold type]scavenge[roman type] in any room you can fast travel from to hunt for food and water."
"Socializing"	"You can [bold type]talk (person)[roman type] to chat. If they are of more personal interest to you, you can also [bold type]fuck (person)[roman type] instead."
"Ending Early"	"Type [bold type]end now[roman type] to cause the game to end early. Alternatively you can [bold type]give in[roman type] to the infection."
"Play On"	"You want to skip that ending? Go for it. Type [bold type]play on[roman type] and time will cease to be a concern. You will not get endings though."
"Wait Less"	"Tired of having to click more to continue much of the text? Type [bold type]Waits Off[roman type] to skip many delays.[line break]Don't like the change and want to go back? Type [bold type]Waits On[roman type] to return to the default."
"Clear Less"	"Don't like the page clearing of text? Want the combat interface at the bottom of the screen? Type [bold type]Clears Off[roman type] to stop screen clearing.[line break]Don't like the change and want to go back? Type [bold type]Clears On[roman type] to return to the default."
"Auto Attack"	"If you have the [']Instinctive Combat['] feat you can use different automatic attacks. These are the same as picking the same option over and over again during combat. No different results, just less typing for faster gameplay.[line break]Type [bold type]auto attack normal[roman type] for the default method of combat (choose each action).[line break]Type [bold type]auto attack berserk[roman type] to always attack in combat.[line break]Type [bold type]auto attack seduce[roman type] to always seduce in combat.[line break]Type [bold type]auto attack pass[roman type] to always pass in combat.[line break]Type [bold type]auto attack coward[roman type] to always flee in combat.[line break]Type [bold type]auto attack submit[roman type] to always submit in combat."
