Chapter 6 - Guessing Periods

to guesstimate time at (x - a number):
	if x < 0:
		say "ERROR: Negative time period.";
	else if x is 0:
		say "under three hour";
	else if x <= 10:
		say "[x * 3] hours"; [up to 30 hrs]
	else if x <= 14:
		say "a day and a half or so"; [up to 42 hrs]
	else if x <= 18:
		say "two days or so"; [up to 54 hrs]
	else if x <= 22:
		say "two and a half days or so"; [up to 66 hrs]
	else if x <= 28:
		say "three days or so"; [up to 84 hrs]
	else:
		say "[( x / 8 )] days";

Chapter 7 - Extra Play-Time

To Extend game by (x - a number):
	decrease targetturns by x;
	say "[bold type]((You have earned additional time: [x divided by 8] days, [(remainder after dividing x by 8) times 3] hours))[roman type][line break]";
