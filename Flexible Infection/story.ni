Piercing its large directed ears are one ring a piece, one a goldish hue, and another silverish shade. It's covered from top to bottom in ebony black fur, that is, where clothing is not apparent. Her eyes are the same black shade as her hair, the left eye having a scar that runs an inch above downwards in a slicing motion to an inch or two below.
		 She wears a rather large leather collar with a bell attached, the bell portion resting between the massive pillows of her chest, resting on top of them like some sort of sacred artifact. The bell makes no sound. Her breasts are restrained by her leather suit, the two upside down V's struggling mightily with small buckles between them just to keep them fastened and avoid falling apart. They might be seven or so inches in radius, and the leather doesn't do much to hide the details from the front, indents visible in the leather, revealing more than it aught to.[line break]
		 Her arms are long and slender, with black fur, and bright pink shaded paws. The paws have clearly defined fingers, looking quite capable of grasping things, or clawing, with sharp black shaded tips to them. Her midsection is slim and trim, and also concealed fully by the leather bodice she wears, clinging tightly to her contours.[line break]
		 Gazing at her from the back, it can be seen that the leather doesn't cover much back there beyond decency. Her furred buttocks and thighs are visible, though calves are again covered in the suit. From the front, an odd sight greets the eyes. The contours of the leather shape outwards from her thighs and along her belly, the shape is distinct and hard to miss, as if this bizarre furred female were in the possession of monstrously large male genitalia. She makes no move to be discreet or hide this abnormality, seeming perfectly at ease with its existence, probably having been the one to modify the suit in the first place to cope with such an unwieldy intruder.[line break]
		 Glancing back down to her feet, they are garbed in simple shoes, looking dated and warn from far too much overuse and abuse."	--

It is something of a wonder that she remains so agile, with her lower torso bearing equally enormous pillows, big enough to take up all the space between all four legs in many rows of milk producing hedonism. Despite this, she gingerly turns around, raising her long feline tail to reveal her pouting nethers. Beneath, large furry balls and the start of a sheath. You've seen that thing ready before, ready for a horse. That isn't your concern right now though.[line break][line break]You hurry up behind her and grab around her lower hips, pulling her back as you sink into her.

Book 6 - Help

[In game help topics. Information about the game and how to play it.]
A help-topic is a kind of value. Some help-topics are defined by the Table of Infection Help.

Table of Infection Help
help-topic	reply
Cheating	"What, cheating? Well, OK, fine, if you must.[line break]setwill (number): Change your willpower.[line break]setreflex (number): Change your reflex."
Clothes	"Clothing keeps you decent, it also can give you some measure of defense against some monster attacks. If you want to enjoy the benefits of clothes, you must [bold type]wear[roman type] them. If you grow a new body part, it may destroy the clothing worn over it.[line break]Example: [bold type]wear shirt[roman type]"
Credits	"Based on [quotation mark]Wave of Change[quotation mark] by Nuku Valente (http://www.yiffstar.com/?pid=59286)
Which was based on [quotation mark]Flexible Infection[quotation mark] by Shrimpy (http://www.tfgamessite.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=133&sid=9f67dc9b9cf43a23ce5af7a2c61fc01f)[line break]Some bugfixes and optimizations by Nuku Nookee, including the rope and wait commands."
Food	"There are some things that are very tasty. If you see such an object and wish to partake, don't hesitate to [bold type]eat[roman type] it.[line break]Example: [bold type]eat egg[roman type]"
Game Over	"It is game over when you are fully infected, and fail a willpower save. When this happens, you will be given a last glimpse of what you have become. There is also a chance of an ending being displayed. The ending depends on what you did during play, and what your final form is. Being entirely infected by a creature is an obvious ending, but there are many others, some involving combinations of creatures."
Items	"If you see an object you want to have [bold type]get[roman type] it. You can carry as much as you want.[line break]Example: [bold type]get pants[roman type]"
Killing	"Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. You can attack and slay creatures and people if you want. Killing a person who is not a monster brands you as dangerous however, and people will react accordingly, running away or attacking you as proper. If you are entirely infected (purity 0), attacking a person will infect them instead of killing them.[line break]Example: [bold type]kill person[roman type]"
Observation	"Looking around is a good idea to know what you are dealing with. You can even [bold type]look at me[roman type] to see yourself, or what you've become.[line break]Example: [bold type]look at person[roman type]"
Idling	"Just want time to pass? Use the wait command. Try wait ten minutes or wait an hour."
Movement	"Movement is one of the most basic actions of the game. To move, type the name of the direction you want to go.[line break]Example: [bold type]north[roman type]"
Mutation	"Generally, one would consider mutation a bad thing. Eating infected food or coming into contact with monsters can lead to mutations. Once a body part is mutated, it will spread the infection outwards across your body. If a central body part, or multiple bodyparts are infected, it's even possible for the infection to spread faster as a result. If your entire body is mutated, you may become a monster yourself. It is possible for different infections to 'compete' for a hosts body, causing the mutation to sweep back and forth over the body as they vie for dominance. You may [bold type]submit[roman type] to a monster if you would like it to infect you, although this not recommended."
Saving	"To save the game, type [bold type]SAVE[roman type]. You will be prompted to supply a file-name for your saved game. If you'd like to return to play at that point again later, [bold type]RESTORE[roman type] the saved game."
Scanner	"[bold type]Look at scanner[roman type] to see how many infected people (monsters) and how many uninfected people (normal people) are in the city."
Monster Commands	"What's that? You[apostrophe]re a monster now? Well some monsters can do weird things like 'feed' their milk to people, giving out a mighty 'flare' of flames at someone, or if you're large enough, why not just 'grab' people? If you happen to have one, you could also 'pouch' your victims into your safe place."


Understand "help [help-topic]" as asking for help about. Asking for help about is an action out of world, applying to one help-topic.

[World.Items end]
[World.Places start]

[To add your monsters to the game, they need to be in the room. Also, because of the way the TFs work on NPCs (replacing them rather than actually changing them), you'll need a number of whatever monsters you have in the room called "holdingpen". That's the room that creatures and things we don't really need sit in until they need to be used.
Adding a room is pretty easy. You can either write "<Room name> is a room." the way I have with Johnson Park below to define a room specifically, or "<Direction> of the <Room 1> is <Room 2>." to define new rooms that are in directions from old rooms. You can see this done with most of the lines of code.
Adding creatures and characters into the areas is a cinch. Just add the line "<Some number of> people are in <the name of a room>.", and that number of people will start the game in that room. You can see that I've done this for several rooms below. Monsters are added in much the same way, but using the monster's name rather than the word "people". Always remember: for every kind of monster that you have, you need a number of that monster equal to the number of people to be placed in holdingpen.
You can also use the line "The player is in <a room>." to tell the game what room the player starts in.
That's all there is to it! Just a word of warning: if you have too many people and monsters running around, it could seriously degrade the performance of the game and cause some massive slowdown. It's not really a concern with things in holdingpen since AI doesn't run for them, but for every person or monster that isn't in that room a pretty substantial chunk of code has to be run every single turn.
Well, have fun! And remember, there's no harm in experimenting a bit - if you screw something up, you can always just revert to this original code, and if you don't you might even come up with some really great stuff!]

The map-canvas is a g-canvas. The associated canvas of the map-window is the map-canvas.

The associated canvas of the map-renderer is the map-canvas. The associated canvas of a UI-element is the map-canvas. The associated canvas of a g-element is the map-canvas.

[When play begins:
	follow the opening up the map window rules.]

Understand "[any room]" as going by name. Understand "go to [any room]" as going by name.

Going by name is an action applying to one thing.

Check going by name:
	if the noun is the location, say "You're already in [the location]." instead;
	if the noun is not adjacent and the noun is unvisited, say "That noun did not make sense in this context." instead.

Carry out going by name:
	let aim be the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;
	if aim is not a direction, say "You can't think how to get there from here." instead;
	say "(heading [aim])[command clarification break]";
	try going aim;
	if the location is not the noun, say "You'll have to stop here."

Automap graphlink rule for a room (called the target):
	let target-text be the printed name of the target in upper case;
	now glulx replacement command is "GO TO [target-text]";
	exit.

Chapter - Graphic Windows exempt from GLIMMR canvas rules

A graphics g-window is either canvas-controlled or not canvas-controlled. A graphics g-window is usually canvas-controlled.

The graphics-window is not canvas-controlled. The graphic-status-window is not canvas-controlled.

A window-drawing rule for a graphics g-window (called the window) (this is the clever canvas-based drawing rule):
	if the window is g-present and the window is canvas-controlled:
		#if utilizing Glimmr debugging;
		say "[>console][paragraph break][CBD]Following the default canvas-based drawing rule for the window [i][window][/i].[<]";
		#
		carry out the scaling activity with the window;
		carry out the offset calculation activity with the window;
		carry out the window-framing adjustment activity with the window;
		clear the window;
		carry out the drawing the canvas background activity with the window;
		carry out the drawing the active elements activity with the window.

[Procedural rule: substitute the clever canvas-based drawing rule for the default canvas-based drawing rule.]

Part - Window setup at the start of play

Every turn when the startcount is 5:
	increase the startcount by 1;
	[change the command prompt to "[if the player is partly infected or the player is fully infected][Player_Name](infected)[else][Player_Name][end if] >";]
	open up the side-window;

Check waiting more:
	if the time understood is greater than one hour, say "You really haven't got that kind of patience." instead.

Carry out waiting more:
	let the target time be the time of day plus the time understood;
	decrease the target time by one minute;
	while the time of day is not the target time:

Part - Enhanced Items

Chapter - Rope

A rope is a kind of thing.

Definition: a thing is nonrope if it is not a rope. [The perfect idiocy of this statement notwithstanding, having a shortcut will come in very handy later]

Attachment relates things to each other in groups. The verb to be stuck to implies the attachment relation.

Definition: a thing is tied if the number of things stuck to it is greater than 1.

Definition: a thing is free if it is not tied.

Definition: a rope is free if the number of nonrope things stuck to it is less than 2.

Definition: a thing is hindering if it is stuck to the noun and it is not within the location.

A thing can be round or unevenly shaped. A thing is usually round. The player is unevenly shaped. A person is usually unevenly shaped. A monster is usually unevenly shaped. An infection model is usually round. A sturdy stump is usually unevenly shaped.

Definition: something is anchored if it is fixed in place or it is scenery or it is part of an anchored thing.

Definition: something is draggable if it is not had by the player and it is not the player and it is not anchored.

Description of a rope is "A rope.". 1 rope is in Apartment 1A. 1 rope is in Ranch Office. 1 rope is in Al's Hunting Emporium.

[Now, we want a rope to be described in terms of the way it is tied, when it's described in a room description.]

Rule for writing a paragraph about a rope (called the coil):
	if the coil is stuck to something which is in a room (called the next room) which is not the location:
		let the way be the best route from the location to the next room, using even locked doors;
		if the way is up or the way is down:
			say "[The coil] runs [way] into [the next room].";
		else:
			say "[The coil] snakes across the floor [way] towards [the next room].";
	else:
		say "There is [a coil] here[if the coil is stuck to a visible nonrope thing], tied to [the list of nonrope visible things which are stuck to the coil][end if]."

understand "wear rope" as fashion styling.
fashion styling is an action applying to nothing.

carry out fashion styling:
	say "You consider the style a moment... nah, not working for you.";
	stop the action;

To decide what room is the home of (item - a thing):
	let next room be an object;
	if item is a door:
		let front cut be the number of moves from the location to the front side of the item;
		let back cut be the number of moves from the location to the back side of the item;
		if front cut is -1, let front cut be 999;
		if back cut is -1, let back cut be 999;
		if front cut is greater than back cut, let next room be the back side of the item;
		otherwise let next room be the front side of the item;
		if the location encloses the item, let next room be the location;
	else:
		let the next room be the location of the item;
	decide on the next room.

Rule for writing a paragraph about a nonrope thing (called the anchor) which is stuck to a rope (called the coil):
	if the coil is in an adjacent room:
		let the next room be the home of the coil;
		let the way be the best route from the location to the next room, using even locked doors;
		if the way is up or the way is down:
			say "[The coil] runs [way] from [the anchor] into [the next room].";
		else:
			say "From [the anchor] runs [a coil], heading off toward [way].";
	else:
		if the coil is stuck to something which is not visible,
			say "[The coil] is tied to [the anchor][if the coil is stuck to something in an adjacent room (called the next room)], and from there runs off towards [the next room][end if]."

[We need a way to account for it when it's being carried, as well.]

After printing the name of a rope (called the tied object) while taking inventory:
	if something nonrope is stuck to the tied object:
		say " (attached to [the list of nonrope things which are stuck to the tied object])";
	else:
		say " (with both ends free)".

[And, indeed, whenever the player examines a rope, we should see what's connected.]

Instead of examining a rope (called the strand) when something is stuck to the strand:
	say "[The noun] is tied to [the list of secondary things which are stuck to the noun]."

[Similarly, any time the player looks at something tied to a rope.]

After examining the player when the player is stuck to something which is not the player:
	say "You're currently lashed to [the list of secondary things stuck to the noun]."

After examining something which is stuck to something secondary:
	say "[The noun] is currently attached to [the list of secondary things stuck to the noun]."

[We also need to make sure that the rope can be interacted with properly even when it's partly in the next room.]

After deciding the scope of the player:
	if something stuck to a rope (called the coil) is in the location, place the coil in scope.

A reaching inside rule:
	if the noun is a rope:
		let the anchor be a random visible thing stuck to the noun;
		if the anchor is touchable, allow access.

[Now tying:]

Before tying something to a rope:
	if the noun is stuck to the second noun, say "[The noun] and [the second noun] are already tied together." instead;
	if the second noun is not free, say "[The second noun] has no ends free." instead;
	if the noun is round and the noun is not fixed in place, say "You can't realistically tie anything to [the noun]." instead.

Instead of tying a rope to something:
	try tying the second noun to the noun.

Instead of tying a player to a rope:
	say "This is no time to indulge in your BDSM fantasies!";

does the player mean tying an infection model to a rope: It is very unlikely.

Instead of tying something to a rope:
	now the noun is stuck to the second noun;
	say "You loop [the second noun] around [the noun] and knot firmly."


Instead of tying something to a nonrope tied thing:
	let the coil be a random rope stuck to the second noun;
	try tying the noun to the coil.

Instead of tying a nonrope tied thing to something:
	let the coil be a random rope stuck to the noun;
	try tying the second noun to the coil.

Instead of tying a free nonrope thing to a free nonrope thing:
	if the player carries a free rope (called the coil):
		try tying the noun to the coil;
		if the noun is stuck to the coil and the coil is free:
			try tying the second noun to the coil;
	else:
		say "You lack the requisite spare rope."

Understand "untie [something] from [something]" as untying it from. Understand "untie [something]" as untying it from.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while untying something from:
	if the number of secondary things stuck to the noun is 0, say "[The noun] is already entirely free." instead;
	if the noun is a rope:
		if the number of touchable nonrope things which are stuck to the noun > 1:
			say "You'll have to say which thing you want to untie [the noun] from.";
			rule fails;
		else:
			if the number of touchable nonrope things stuck to the noun is 0, say "You can't reach [the random nonrope thing stuck to the noun]." instead;
			let the tied object be a random touchable nonrope thing which is stuck to the noun;
			say "(from [the tied object])[line break]";
			now the second noun is the tied object;
	else:
		if the noun is stuck to a rope (called the tied object):
			say "(from [the tied object])[line break]";
			now the second noun is the tied object.

Untying it from is an action applying to two things.

Before untying a rope from something: try untying the second noun from the noun instead.

Before untying something from a rope:
	if the second noun is not held:
		say "(first picking up [the second noun])[line break]";
		try taking the second noun.

Check untying it from:
	unless the noun is stuck to the second noun or the second noun is stuck to the noun,
		say "[The noun] and [the second noun] are already not tied together." instead.

Carry out untying it from:
	now the noun is not stuck to the second noun.

Report untying it from:
	say "Untied."


[Another part of the fun of a rope is that you can drag things from another room:]

After reading a command: now every thing is unmentioned.

Before pulling something anchored: say "[The noun] is firmly anchored." instead.

Instead of pulling something tied:
	if the noun is unmentioned:
		say "The impulse is transmitted to [the list of pullable things stuck to the noun].";
		repeat with item running through pullable things stuck to the noun:
			say "[item]: [run paragraph on]";
			try pulling the item;
		if the noun is a rope and the noun is not within the location:
			if the number of nonrope hindering things is 0, move the noun to the location;
	else:
		continue the action.

Before pulling something which is not visible:
	if the noun is anchored:
		say "[The noun] resists, for whatever reason." instead;
	else:
		let space be the holder of the noun;
		let way be the best route from the space to the location, using even locked doors;
		if the way is a direction:
			move the noun to the location;
			say "[The noun] [if the way is up]rises[else]slides[end if] into view." instead;
		else:
			move the noun to the location;
			say "[The noun] slides into view." instead.

Definition: a thing is secondary if it is not the noun. Definition: a thing is pullable if it is not the noun and it is not the player.

[A player who is tied to things should also have some restrictions on his ability to move.]

Before going a direction (called the way) when the player has something (called the link) which is stuck to something anchored (called the anchor):
	let the next room be the home of the anchor;
	if the next room is not a room, continue the action;
	if the next room is the location:
		if the link is stuck to at least two anchored things,
			say "You can't go far while you're carrying [the link] tied to [the list of anchored things stuck to the link]." instead;
	else:
		let the safe way be the best route from the location to the next room, using even locked doors;
		if the safe way is the way:
			if the player is not stuck to the anchor, say "(coiling up your rope again as you go...)";
		else:
			if the safe way is a direction:
				let Dtmp be the best route from the location to the next room, using even locked doors;
				say "While you have [the link] you can't really head any direction but [Dtmp]." instead;
			else:
				say "You're tied up here." instead.

Before going a direction (called the way) when the player is stuck to something anchored (called the anchor):
	let the next room be the home of the anchor;
	if the next room is not a room, continue the action;
	if the next room is the location:
		if the player is stuck to at least two anchored things,
			say "You can't go far while you're tied to [the list of anchored things stuck to the player]." instead;
	else:
		if the best route from the location to the next room, using even locked doors is the way:
			say "(coiling up your rope again as you go...)";
		else:
			let Dtmp be the best route from the location to the next room, using even locked doors;
			say "Your attachments prevent you going any way but [Dtmp]." instead.

[Sometimes, if the player is tied to a movable object, the moved object will move with him.]

After going somewhere when the player has something (called the link) which is stuck to something draggable:
	if the player is not stuck to the link:
		say "You drag along behind you [the list of draggable things which are stuck to the link].";
		now every draggable thing which is stuck to the link is in the location;
	continue the action.

Report going somewhere when the player is stuck to something draggable:
	say "You drag along behind you [the list of draggable things which are stuck to the player].";
	now every draggable thing which is stuck to the player is in the location.
