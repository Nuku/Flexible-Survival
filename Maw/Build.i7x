Build by Maw begins here.

Part - Change Builds

builds is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "plan" as builds.
Understand "build" as builds.

Check builds:
	if blueprints is not visible, say "You can't check your building designs without... your designs!" instead;

carry out builds:
	say "Available Designs: [no line break]";
	repeat with x running through valid construct:
		if x is complete, next;
		LineBreak;
		say "[x]([progress of x]/[cost of x])[if building of blueprints is x](building construction)[end if][no line break]";
	say "To begin a new build, type [bold type]build (building) at (direction)[roman type].";

constructing is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing.
Understand "Build [any Construct] at [direction]" as constructing.
Understand "Build [any Construct] in [direction]" as constructing.
Understand "Build [any Construct] to [direction]" as constructing.

Check constructing:
	if blueprints is not visible, say "You can't give orders to your builders while you don't have your designs with you!" instead;
	if noun is complete or noun is placed, say "That building has already been constructed" instead;
	if noun is building of blueprints and blueprints is started, say "Your builders stare at you, hammers and two-by-fours in hand, looking about ready to hammer you upside the head with both, 'We are working on it.' Maybe you should hire more builders?" instead;
	if second noun is valid, say "There's something in the way, boss." instead;
	if the second noun is not east and the second noun is not west and the second noun is not north and the second noun is not south, say "What direction? Let's keep it to the basic cardinals." instead;

Carry out constructing:
	say "[description of noun]";
	say "[line break]Construct?";
	if Player consents:
		now building of blueprints is noun;
		now origin of blueprints is location of Player;
		now facing of blueprints is second noun;
		now blueprints is started;
		say "Your builders begin constructing [noun].";
	else:
		say "Aborted.";

The maximum of builder is maxbuilder rule.

This is the maxbuilder rule:
