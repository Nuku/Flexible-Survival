Creeping down the tunnel, you round the corner and spot a frog woman digging through a flooded hole in the wall. She looks rather thin, and her skin is a dull green. 'Come on, come on...' she says to herself as she continues to search the hole. After a few moments, she withdraws her arms from the crevice with a weary sigh. 'Nothing...' The female amphibian moves to leave, but she freezes when she happens to turn in your direction and spots you. With a startled yelp, she hastily backpedals away from you.";

'Sorry about that,' she apologizes. 'Just can't be too careful with all of the craziness going on.' When you ask her what she was doing earlier, she replies, 'I was trying to find some food and clean water, but... um... I'm not exactly doing well. Oh, um, my name is Ranae, by the way.'";
	say "     As you introduce yourself, you're able to look at her a bit closer. She was not kidding about her miserable search for supplies. It looks like she hasn't been eating well, if at all, for a few days. Her green-speckled skin is drawn tight across her body, the colors muted, and her skin lacks the shine of most amphibians. Her legs are thin and stringy, and her dirty clothes hang loosely on her frame. The frog coughs to draw your attention back. 'Look, um, you seem to be doing alright with the whole surviving thing... a lot better than I am... It's just that, I'm really in a bad spot, and I would really appreciate it if you could spare me some food and water.'";

You give her a smile and a nod, and the frog squeals in delight as she takes your gifts. 'Oh my god! Finally, water! I never thought that I'd miss clean water!' she cries before popping the cap off of the bottle and begin guzzling down the life-giving liquid. The amphibian drains the entire bottle in a matter of moments, and she promptly rips into the food right afterwards. The entire time, you just awkwardly stand there, watching as Ranae gorges herself, her loud chomping echoing through the sewer. It doesn't take long for her to finish devouring her meal, and you can already see that her belly is no longer concaved. The frog licks her fingers to get the last crumbs, only to freeze when she glances in your direction, and her face flushes red when she realizes that you're still here.";

You oblige Ranae and let her lead you through the sewers until you reach a tall, narrow hole in the wall. It's a bit of a squeeze, but you follow the frog through it, and you find yourself in a dark, dank enclosed space that's about the size of a walk-in closet. The only items that marks the dreary room as a living space are a few pillows and a ragged blanket in the corner. 'It's not much, but it's mine,' Ranae explains.

	say "     During your search for supplies, you come to a small shop in the middle of a quiet street. Looking through the display window, you note that the place used to be a clothes boutique for women, judging by the number of dresses that are littering the floor. Seeing that nobody seems to be occupying the building, you decide to go in and look around for supplies. Digging through the wreckage, it soon becomes obvious that a number of people had been here before you since you find nothing of use. All of the clothes that you inspect are either covered in cum or damaged, which is a shame because many of the dresses would've looked beautiful if they had been kept in pristine condition. In the corner, you see a doorway leading to the backroom, as well as a pair of female mannequins that someone had jokingly set up so that they were touching each other's breasts.";
	say "     Entering the backroom, you find that it's the same story as the front when you don't turn up anything useful. Besides a bunch of empty boxes, the only thing of note are several tall lockers along the wall, presumably for the former employees. All but one had been plundered, and that remaining locker is securely shut by a built-in lock that could only be unlocked by a key. Just as you turn around to give up your search, you lose your balance when you trip on a small box. You flail about and manage to keep yourself from falling, but not before you hit some boxes. As you curse your clumsiness, you pause when you spot a key that had been hidden under the box pile you had just knocked over. Figuring that it was at least worth a try, you pick up the key and use it on the locker. To your surprise, it actually works, and the locker opens to reveal a brown paper bag and a black dress hanging on a hook. Hardly believing your luck, you first look into the paper bag and find a bag of chips, a soda can, and a bottle of water packed inside.";

Unfortunately, a dress such as this would not be practical for you[if scalevalue of Player < 3], given how you're too small for it[else if scalevalue of Player > 3], given how you're too large for it[end if]. However, you recall how Ranae has been looking for some new clothes, and this dress seems to be the perfect size for her.

	say "     Exploring through one of the city's many streets, you come to a two-story building that has wooden boards covering every window and doorway. Chances are that the building was abandoned and boarded-up before all of the chaos started, but you figure you might as well try your luck and take a look inside. That is, if you can find a way to get in. Examining the boards up close, you find that all of them are securely in place, barring any chance of an easy entrance. You briefly consider trying to force your way in, but you dismiss the idea as it would take too much effort, not to mention that the noise would likely attract unwanted attention. Searching for an alternate route, you move into a small alleyway to the right of the building.";
	say "     Curiously, you find a ladder peeking out from under a tarp that seems to have been hastily thrown over it. Even more curious is the fact that the ladder is located under a large boarded-up window on the second floor. Figuring that it's at least worth investigating, you pull out the ladder from the tarp, prop it against the wall, and use it to climb up to the window. To your surprise, the wood blocking your way budges when you touch it, and with a bit more pushing, you're able to move the board to the side, finally giving you a way in. When you climb through the window, you're disappointed to find that the room you have snuck into, as well as the adjacent ones, are all completely bare, confirming that the place was abandoned some time ago.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     However, not wanting to give up so quickly, you make your way to the opposite side of the building and find a sleeping bag and a small pack tucked away in the corner. You quickly check to make sure that there's nothing else in the rest of the building before you search through the makeshift camp. Judging by the layer of dust on the items, it looks like the owner of the meager belongings will not be returning. Searching through the pack, you find a tin of food, which you happily pocket, as well as an odd object wrapped up with newspaper. Peeling away the paper, you find a small figurine of a woman attached to a dome-like wooden base.";
	say "     The tiny female is wearing a green dress that completely covers her legs, and she has one arm raised up high with another stretched out in a dancing pose. Turning the object around, you find a wind-up key at the back of the base. You give the key a few turns, which makes the figurine start to slowly spin around as the soft sounds of a music box begins playing. Although the song and dance is short, it is charming enough to make you smile a little. As you look over the figurine, wondering what you're going to do with it, the dancer's green dress grabs your attention, the color almost the same shade as Ranae's skin. Perhaps the frog girl will appreciate a gift like this. After covering the gift back up with newspaper and safely tucking the gift away in your pack, you exit the building through the same window you crawled in through, making a note to bring your find to Ranae when you have the time.";

Though the door remains intact, the display window in the front of the building has been completely shattered, glass shards littering the nearby sidewalk. It's obvious the place was ransacked, but you briefly wonder why this particular shop was robbed, given how the adjacent stores seemed to be untouched, but your question is soon answered when you glance up at the place's storefront sign, or rather, what used to be it. You're unable to read the shop's name because the sign is completely covered with graffiti drawings of dicks and other crude images, along with spray-painted words such as [']cheap bastard,['] [']lying asshole,['] and other spiteful titles. It looks like that the owner of the shop wasn't popular, and you guess that someone took advantage of the city's chaos to take action against the supposed swindler.";
	say "     Taking a look through the broken window, you see that although the shop has been looted, there still seems to be various items lying around. Figuring that it's at least worth a quick look, you climb in through the window, careful to avoid the broken glass. Searching around, you find an assortment of items, all with handmade price tags attached to them, and you guess that this place used to be a sort of pawn shop. Unfortunately, anything worthwhile seems to already be gone, and all of the things that have been left behind are either of little use or too bulky to safely carry out of here. It doesn't take long for you to finish searching the small storefront, and you head through a doorway in the back, only to find a room barely bigger than a closet. With a small desk and a filing cabinet with three drawers in one corner and several small boxes in another, this tiny space doubled as an office and a storage room.";
	say "     Searching through the filing cabinet first, you find receipts and business-related papers in the top two drawers that pretty much confirms that the shop had been cheating their customers out of a fair deal. When you open the bottom drawer, you find some books, but more importantly, a bottle of water. With the current state of the place and the reputation of the former store owner, you have no qualms taking the precious supply for yourself. You then move on to the boxes, opening them one by one as you search their contents. At first, all you find are various odd knick-knacks or low-quality items that don't look like they would have sold, but you pause when you eventually come upon a bundle of green fabric, its color reminding you of Ranae. Unfolding your find, you see that the fabric is actually a set of drapes with an embroidered pattern of swirls decorating its front. Thinking that the frog staying in the library might like these drapes to help decorate her living space, you stow them into your bag. Finding nothing else of interest in the shop, you climb back through the broken window and resume your exploration.";

Looking around, you see your caller standing in a nearby alleyway, waving you over with a black and brown paw. Though the person doesn't seem to be hostile, the long trench coat that almost reach down to their feet and a fedora hat that covers their face doesn't completely put you at ease. Cautiously walking over to the suspicious figure, you're able to see that the person is a male raccoon. 'Hey, you want to buy something?' the raccoon asks as he uses a hand to grab one side of his coat and pull it wide open. Though this act reveals that he's wearing nothing underneath his coat, essentially showing you his furry body, your gaze is focused on the rings, necklaces, bracelets, watches, and other shiny accessories that adorn the inside of his coat. 'I got only the finest stuff here,' the raccoon says with a smirk. 'C'mon, pick a few. I'll give you a good price on them.' However, you aren't able to browse his wares for long before someone from behind yells, 'Hey, you!'";
	say "     Spinning around, you see two harpies approaching, but for some reason, they both seem to be ignoring you in favor of angrily glaring at the raccoon. 'You sold us fake jewelry!' one of the winged females accuses, and the other one promptly adds, 'Yeah! You're going to pay for trying to trick us!' The raccoon yelps and swiftly bolts into the alley, and you have to jump out of the way of the two raging harpies as they pursue the sleazy salesman. The din caused by the wild chase soon fades away, leaving you by yourself. Shaking your head over the odd scenario, you're about to leave when something shimmering on the ground catches your eye. Picking up the object, you see that it's a silver-colored bracelet with its center holding several emeralds arranged in a circular pattern. The raccoon must have dropped this bracelet in his haste to escape, but given the unsatisfied harpies from earlier, this is no doubt just another piece of fake jewelry. Still, the bracelet looks nice enough. Perhaps Ranae would like it.";

Did you come here just to visit me, or is there maybe, um, some other reason you're here?' she asks. Despite staring at you with big, hopeful eyes, you notice her gaze constantly flicks toward your pack. Red floods Ranae's cheeks when she realizes you're looking at her with both skepticism and amusement, and she hastily apologizes, 'S-sorry. I really am glad to see you. It's just that-' She's interrupted when her stomach rumbles, and you can't help but chuckle in amusement as the blushing frog turns more red than green.";

'I just wish that I could find some better clothes. I'm getting tired of wearing these dirty things.'

As the green lady backs away from the hug, you see that she's no longer wearing anything. Noticing your stare, Ranae blushes and folds one arm across her chest to cover her breasts while the other moves down to block her cunt. 'Um, yeah. Sorry about this. My clothes finally gave out a little while ago. I know that going without clothes is sort of the norm in all of this craziness, but it just doesn't feel right to walk around nude. I really hope that I find something to wear soon.'";

'Is... is that really for me?' she asks, unable to stop staring at the dress. You nod and let the amphibian slowly take it from you. 'This... It's beautiful...' Ranae says, gingerly holding the garment up and feeling the silky material. 'Thank you...' Unable to contain her excitement any longer, she squeals in delight and quickly slips into the dress. The low cut dress is clearly made to show off the wearer's body, with only two narrow strips holding the dress on Ranae's shoulders to prominently display both her arms and the top of her breasts. The fabric clings close to her skin, showing hints of her lithe figure, but given her bodacious rear, the fabric actually accentuates the rounded curves of her ass. Like her arms, her legs are left open to be shown off to the world as the hemline of the dress stops right at her knees. Although not the most practical clothing for the city's current situation, Ranae is undeniably ecstatic about her new dress, not to mention looking so much more sexier.";

Eventually, she stops her one woman fashion show and walks over to you with a mischievous smirk. Playfully scratching the underside of your chin with a finger, she teases, 'Careful now. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that you're out to spoil me.'";

'I just had an interesting idea,' the female frog informs as she sashays over to you. 'We're going to try something different... very different.' Before you can ask for more details, she pushes you onto the nearby mattress and leers down at you. 'Mmm, something tell me that I'm going to enjoy this... a lot.' Ranae lets her dress slip down to the floor, but you barely have time to take in her naked body before she moves over your prone body, turns around, and drops her bodacious green booty right on your face. You're smothered under her wondrous globes, the combination of her smooth skin and the musky aroma emanating from her rear already starting to arouse you. You're given no respite as the dominating amphibian rocks her hips, wedging you further between her cheeks.";
	say "     At first, you assume that she wants you to service her with your tongue, but when you try to lick into her crevice, the task is made difficult from her constant movements as she continues to aggressively grind her ass into your face until, somehow, her sphincter stretches to take in your head. Although slightly muffled by her cushioned behind, Ranae moans loudly with pleasure over your anal insertion, and you can feel the muscles of her rectum clamp down as they work on drawing in the rest of your body. Your hands instinctively move to the green globes smothering you to try and push back, but all of your efforts amount to is the equivalent of squeezing and groping the cushy derriere. Ranae moans again from your unintentional massage, and with a giggle, she says, 'With how you've been enamored by my ass, I thought that you would love a closer look at it. Just relax and let it happen. I'm enjoying this, and you can too.'";

Even though her ass is stretched to inhuman levels, by the sound of Ranae's delighted cries, she's having the time of her life reducing you to nothing more than a giant, squirming dildo. Slowly but surely, the frog takes you in through her back entrance, and when your shoulders finally fully pop into the dark, musky tunnel, Ranae is brought to her climax. She howls in ecstasy and drenches the bottom half of your body with her femcum just before it too is swallowed by her rear, the frog's ass claiming all of you as her own.";
	say "     Ranae's orgasm is drawn out by you utterly filling her, your squirming body rubbing all over her inner depths, but you barely notice her ecstasy as the tight constricting tunnel of her anal walls draw you deeper into the horny female. Slick flesh rubs into you from all angles as you're ferried through the churning darkness. Your journey eventually comes to an end when you feel yourself being pushed up against a wall, but it only takes a moment for you to be squeezed through it and into a small chamber that forces you to curl up into a ball. As you situate yourself in the twisted confines, you realize that you had ended up in the frog's stomach. 'That... that was awesome,' Ranae comments, her voice weary but clearly pleased. She flops back onto the mattress and then pats her belly, which is now extremely distended to house you. 'It was so hot that I got to use you both as a toy and a meal.
