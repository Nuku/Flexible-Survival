	say "     While wandering through the sewers, you hear the splashing of water and someone softly mumbling coming down from one of the passageways. Creeping down the tunnel, you round the corner and spot a frog woman digging through a flooded hole in the wall. She looks rather thin, and her skin is a dull green. 'Come on, come on...' she says to herself as she continues to search the hole. After a few moments, she withdraws her arms from the crevice with a weary sigh. 'Nothing...' The female amphibian moves to leave, but she freezes when she happens to turn in your direction and spots you. With a startled yelp, she hastily backpedals away from you.";

	say "You quickly explain that you are merely exploring and that you mean her no harm. Eventually, after a bit more coaxing, the frog calms down and slowly walks toward you. 'Sorry about that,' she apologizes. 'Just can't be too careful with all of the craziness going on.' When you ask her what she was doing earlier, she replies, 'I was trying to find some food and clean water, but... um... I'm not exactly doing well. Oh, um, my name is Ranae, by the way.'";
	say "     As you introduce yourself, you're able to look at her a bit closer. She was not kidding about her miserable search for supplies. It looks like she hasn't been eating well, if at all, for a few days. Her green-speckled skin is drawn tight across her body, the colors muted, and her skin lacks the shine of most amphibians. Her legs are thin and stringy, and her dirty clothes hang loosely on her frame. The frog coughs to draw your attention back. 'Look, um, you seem to be doing alright with the whole surviving thing... a lot better than I am... It's just that, I'm really in a bad spot, and I would really appreciate it if you could spare me some food and water.'";

She moves closer, her gaze locked on the precious supplies, but when her hands reach for the rations, she hesitates and looks back up at you. You give her a smile and a nod, and the frog squeals in delight as she takes your gifts. 'Oh my god! Finally, water! I never thought that I'd miss clean water!' she cries before popping the cap off of the bottle and begin guzzling down the life-giving liquid. The amphibian drains the entire bottle in a matter of moments, and she promptly rips into the food right afterwards. The entire time, you just awkwardly stand there, watching as Ranae gorges herself, her loud chomping echoing through the sewer. It doesn't take long for her to finish devouring her meal, and you can already see that her belly is no longer concaved. The frog licks her fingers to get the last crumbs, only to freeze when she glances in your direction, and her face flushes red when she realizes that you're still here.";
			say "     'Um, excuse me?' Ranae sheepishly offers, to which you merely wave off with a smile. 'I really can't thank you enough for your kindness. I'm afraid that I don't have anything to offer you in return... Oh, wait. I know! Could you please follow me?' You oblige Ranae and let her lead you through the sewers until you reach a tall, narrow hole in the wall. It's a bit of a squeeze, but you follow the frog through it, and you find yourself in a dark, dank enclosed space that's about the size of a walk-in closet. The only items that marks the dreary room as a living space are a few pillows and a ragged blanket in the corner. 'It's not much, but it's mine,' Ranae explains.

Looking through the display window, you note that the place used to be a clothes boutique for women, judging by the number of dresses that are littering the floor. Seeing that nobody seems to be occupying the building, you decide to go in and look around for supplies. Digging through the wreckage, it soon becomes obvious that a number of people had been here before you since you find nothing of use. All of the clothes that you inspect are either covered in cum or damaged, which is a shame because many of the dresses would've looked beautiful if they had been kept in pristine condition. In the corner, you see a doorway leading to the backroom, as well as a pair of female mannequins that someone had jokingly set up so that they were touching each other's breasts.";

Besides a bunch of empty boxes, the only thing of note are several tall lockers along the wall, presumably for the former employees. All but one had been plundered, and that remaining locker is securely shut by a built-in lock that could only be unlocked by a key. Just as you turn around to give up your search, you lose your balance when you trip on a small box. You flail about and manage to keep yourself from falling, but not before you hit some boxes. As you curse your clumsiness, you pause when you spot a key that had been hidden under the box pile you had just knocked over. Figuring that it was at least worth a try, you pick up the key and use it on the locker. To your surprise, it actually works, and the locker opens to reveal a brown paper bag and a black dress hanging on a hook. Hardly believing your luck, you first look into the paper bag and find a bag of chips, a soda can, and a bottle of water packed inside.";

Unfortunately, a dress such as this would not be practical for you[if scalevalue of player < 3], given how you're too small for it[else if scalevalue of player > 3], given how you're too large for it[end if]. However, you recall how Ranae has been looking for some new clothes, and this dress seems to be the perfect size for her.

The description of Froggy Hideout is "     You are in Ranae's tiny home in the sewers. There's just enough light for you to make out the frog woman herself as she sits on a few pillows and a ragged blanket, all while looking up at you with an expectant gaze.".

The frog gives you a smile, but it's a weak one, and it quickly disappears after a gloomy sigh. 'I... I really hate to be a bother, but things haven't improved since the last time I saw you. I'm still barely scraping by, and it would mean so much if you could spare me some food and water... I mean, if you had any... or wanted to...'";
	else if hunger of Ranae is 2:
		say "     Ranae is sitting quietly on one of the few pillows that decorate her hovel, a despondent frown marring her face. However, as soon as you enter the hole, she smiles widely and quickly gets up to greet you with a hug. 'Hey there[if player is not defaultnamed], [name of player][end if]! Did you come here just to visit me, or is there maybe, um, some other reason you're here?' she asks. Despite staring at you with big, hopeful eyes, you notice her gaze constantly flicks toward your pack. Red floods Ranae's cheeks when she realizes you're looking at her with both skepticism and amusement, and she hastily apologizes, 'S-sorry. I really am glad to see you. It's just that-' She's interrupted when her stomach rumbles, and you can't help but chuckle in amusement as the blushing frog turns more red than green.";
	else if hunger of Ranae is 4:

'You've been a big help in getting me back on my feet, and I'm actually managing to do alright in getting my own supplies.' She glances down at the tattered rags that used to be her clothes. 'I just wish that I could find some better clothes. I'm getting tired of wearing these dirty things.' As the frog woman tells you of her clothing plight, you make a note to keep an eye out for any shops or [bold type]boutiques[roman type] that might have something suitable for her.";
	else if hunger of Ranae is 5:
		say "     When you step into Ranae's home, the frog woman is quick to give you a hug. 'It's always so good to see you[if player is not defaultnamed], [name of player][end if]. How are you?' As the green lady backs away from the hug, you see that she's no longer wearing anything. Noticing your stare, Ranae blushes and folds one arm across her chest to cover her breasts while the other moves down to block her cunt. 'Um, yeah. Sorry about this. My clothes finally gave out a little while ago. I know that going without clothes is sort of the norm in all of this craziness, but it just doesn't feel right to walk around nude. I really hope that I find something to wear soon.'";
		say "     In response to Ranae's plight, you pull out the black dress that you had found at the boutique and present it to the naked frog, whose eyes grow wide at the prize. 'Is... is that really for me?' she asks, unable to stop staring at the dress. You nod and let the amphibian slowly take it from you. 'This... It's beautiful...' Ranae says, gingerly holding the garment up and feeling the silky material. 'Thank you...' Unable to contain her excitement any longer, she squeals in delight and quickly slips into the dress. The low cut dress is clearly made to show off the wearer's body, with only two narrow strips holding the dress on Ranae's shoulders to prominently display both her arms and the top of her breasts. The fabric clings close to her skin, showing hints of her lithe figure, but given her bodacious rear, the fabric actually accentuates the rounded curves of her ass. Like her arms, her legs are left open to be shown off to the world as the hemline of the dress stops right at her knees. Although not the most practical clothing for the city's current situation, Ranae is undeniably ecstatic about her new dress, not to mention looking so much more sexier.";
		say "     'It's absolutely perfect,' Ranae says, slowly twirling around to get a look at the new her. 'I still can't believe you actually got this just for me.' Eventually, she stops her one woman fashion show and walks over to you with a mischievous smirk. Playfully scratching the underside of your chin with a finger, she teases, 'Careful now. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that you're out to spoil me.'";

The frog woman moves over to the pile of pillows in the corner and lies down on her hands and knees, arching her back so that her ample ass is presented to you. She then looks back at you with a smoldering gaze. 'Come on. You know you want to,' she beckons, punctuating her comment with a gentle sway of her rump that makes those green globes jiggle enticingly. Taking the invitation, you move over to the laying amphibian and kneel down right before that tempting ass. Your hands knead into Ranae's rear, earning you a moan of delight from the frog as you admire the smooth, supple texture. You can't help but revel in the pliant warmth of Ranae's rump, and soon, driven by your lewd desires, you bend down even further and push your head into the crevice between those wondrous green cheeks. 'Oooh, someone is eager,' Ranae commented, only to squeal when your tongue starts to drag across her smooth skin. Blissfully smothered in between two soft mounds, you continue to lick the frog's rear while your hands continue to massage the sides of her bodacious butt and relish the feel of the malleable flesh.";
	say "     You barely hear Ranae's lustful pants as you continue your oral ministrations, and eventually, the frog woman moans as she achieves her climax. Her body goes limp as it falls onto the pillows, and with a bit of reluctance, you pull yourself away from her alluring rear to admire your work. Ranae is breathing heavily from exhaustion, and despite one of the pillows that she is lying on being stained by her juices, the satisfied smile on her face tells you that she doesn't mind one bit. 'Oh wow. That... that was... wow...' Ranae says after a moment of rest, and you lean in to give each of her rear cheeks a kiss, one after the other. She sits up to look at you with a dreamy smile. 'Thanks for that. I thought that I would just be letting you have some fun, but instead, you made it all about me. [one of]A girl like me can get used to attention like that[or]I certainly would not mind having this sort of attention again[or]Careful, or I might just get addicted to this sort of attention[at random].'";

The frog grins mischievously as she beckons you closer, to which you oblige without question. 'I know that you're enamored with me, so it obviously means that your love applies to all parts of me, including my rear. It's a good thing too, because I need a comfier seat.' Before you can ask what she means, Ranae pushes you, making you fall backwards, but fortunately, the seductive amphibian had been subtly maneuvering you around her room so that you would fall on some pillows. Ranae then turns around, looking back at your prone form with a smirk, as she slowly sheds her dress. Though you appreciate the frog woman's body while she reveals her lithe figure, the main attraction comes when she lets the fabric slip below her hips, allowing you to ogle her round, green ass.";

'Be a good [if player is male]boy[else]girl[end if] and worship me,' is all Ranae says before your world becomes cushy, green flesh. The frog's bodacious ass is big enough to cover your entire face, leaving only the very top of your head free. The air becomes heavy and stifling as the amphibian's scent floods your senses.";
