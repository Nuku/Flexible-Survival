PewterPet is a situation.
The sarea of PewterPet is "Capitol".

Instead of resolving PewterPet:
	say "     Your walk down the street is interrupted when a gray feral beast rushes out of a nearby alley. With only a mouth on its otherwise featureless face and its long tail, the beast is none other than a Pewter Consort. You get ready for the creature to come at you, but to your surprise, it bounds off in the opposite direction. You're further surprised when a short, giggling female otter comes running out of the same alleyway. Wearing nothing more than a pink-striped newsboy cap, aqua-blue flower earrings, and a belt-like collar, the small mustelid seems to have no problem showing off her lithe body and an ample ass as she chases after the consort. Following the odd pair from a safe distance, you notice that the both of them have wide smiles on their faces, and you realize that they are simply playing. The game doesn't last much longer though when the otter closes in on her friend, and as she shouts, 'Got you, Ich'Thullain!' she leaps onto her playmate's back, prompting the beast to stop and end the chase.";
	say "     Now that they have stopped moving, you can see that the otter is around three feet tall and is dwarfed by the consort's larger frame. The otter gives the beast, who is apparently named Ich'Thullain, a pat on its back before climbing off of her mount. Ich'Thullain promptly flops onto its side and rolls onto its back, his legs splayed to expose his belly. The female giggles at the display and swiftly climbs back onto her friend. 'Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?' she coos as she rubs the consort's belly with her hands. 'You are, Ich'Thullain! Yes, you are!' It's a curious sight to see the usually lustful beast be treated like an ordinary dog, but by his wagging tail and happy growls, Ich'Thullain doesn't mind one bit. In fact, Ich'Thullain might be enjoying his belly rubs a bit too much when you see his cock start to rise, silvery pre drooling from the head, and begins rubbing against the otter's behind.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A mischievous smirk crosses the water mammal's face as she looks back at the growing spire behind her, obviously expecting Ich'Thullain arousal. As you watch the otter raise her curvaceous hips over the stiff, gray rod, you question if the horny female could actually fit it all. After all, with her tiny body, the consort's cock was more than half her size. Your worries go unfounded when she takes the dripping dick into her cunt in one smooth motion. Before you can ponder on how the stretched otter manages to fit all of that dick inside of her, she goes on a much different ride than the one she was on just a few moments ago as she starts moving her hips up and down. Ich'Thullain's tongue lolls out as he happily pants from his owner's bouncing, and soon, he begins thrusting up in time with the otter's movements.";
	say "     Eventually, the happy couple reach their climaxes simultaneously when the otter happily squeals and suddenly plunges herself onto the twitching shaft. At the same time, Ich'Thullain grabs the female's hips with his forelegs and bucks up, taking her all the way up to the hilt. You watch in fascination while the otter moans in satisfaction, her stomach growing as the consort pumps her tiny frame full of his cum. By the time Ich'Thullain is finished and lets her slip off of him and onto the ground, the mustelid's stomach is distended and looks like she's pregnant with twins, a satisfied smile on her face. After being affectionately licked and nuzzled a bit, the otter stands up with Ich'Thullain's help. The sated female then looks at you, and with a smirk, she shakes her bodacious booty at you, showing off her cum-splattered rear, before climbing onto her pet so that they can ride off, leaving you to return to your exploration.";
	increase score by 5;
	now PewterPet is resolved;

Exploration Events ends here.
