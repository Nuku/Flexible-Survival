Surprisingly, you don't have any encounters during your trek. You're not sure if whether your unabated hike is due to the dense foliage obscuring you or other people just not daring to delve this far into the thicket like you, but it makes the walk through nature almost relaxing, even if you do keep alert for any signs of trouble. Eventually, you spy a camping tent that had been set up in a small clearing, and you scope it out from behind the cover of some nearby bushes. Judging by a few scattered items on the ground, the owner had quickly abandoned the area for some reason, which means that there's a good chance that there might be something left behind for you to scavenge.";

Making your way behind the tent, you find a small cooler, and you open it, only to be disappointed by the sight of food wrappers and empty water bottles. You begin to dig through the trash just to make sure, but a loud wing flap from nearby interrupts you, and a shadow looms over you. Acting on instinct, you dive out of the way right before a dark shape lands right where you were standing. Facing your ambusher, you find a gargoyle leering at you, and it lets loose with a mighty roar.

Turning your attention back to the cooler, you dig through it and manage to find one unopened can of food underneath all of the trash, which you happily pocket. Seeing nothing else of interest around the campsite, you continue your scavenging inside of the tent. The sight of a tattered sleeping bag surrounded by even more empty water bottles greets you, but a thorough search does reveal one bottle with water still left in it. Unfortunately, the water is murky with a brown tinge. It's still drinkable, but it's mostly likely laced with all sorts of infective material. A sudden rustling from the outside makes you freeze, but after a few moments of nothing else happening, you dismiss the noise as the wind and continue your investigation.";

Upon closer inspection, you also note that the sleeping bag was mostly damaged on the inside with scratches and claw marks. Piecing together the clues, it seems like that the former owner of this camp had became infected from drinking too much tainted water and transformed during their sleep, making them go feral and abandon the camp. Perhaps that gargoyle you dealt with a few moments ago was even the same person. Regardless, it doesn't look like that they will be returning to this place, so you exit the tent as you pack away the remaining dirty water next to the can of food you found earlier.";

The reptile is mostly green with a few splotches of either brown or dark-green dotting its body, but the more worrisome part is its size. Its girth was easily as wide as the average human, and even though you could not see where the head or tail were, there's no doubt that this snake was far longer than any other known species. Considering how rapidly this forest had sprouted since the nanite outbreak began, it isn't farfetched to say that this beast had went through the same kind of unnatural growth. You turn to run away from the imposing animal, only to find out that the snake's long body had fully surrounded the campsite, and the coils were still closing in.";

The snake's head finally reveals itself as it descends from the canopy, and the first thing that grabs your attention is its piercing yellow eyes. The serpent smirks at your gaze of wonderment, and to your surprise, it speaks with the same female voice from before. 'I have such wonderful eyes, don't I? I certainly don't mind you admiring them. In fact, why don't you stay with me? You can gaze upon my eyes as long as you want, and I will give you an experience that you will never forget.' She licks her lips, but instead of a forked tongue, a human-like one slips out of her lips. That altered tongue is probably the reason that this animal can talk, but you don't have time to dwell on that for long as she draws closer. You very well know that her invitation is filled with malevolent intent, and yet, as you are unable to break your gaze into those enchanting eyes, you are finding it difficult to refuse her offer, let alone fight her.";

In your addled state, it only takes the slightest push on your chest with her snout to tip you over backwards, but instead of landing on the grass, you fall onto a bundle of coils, which instantly converge on you, completely submerging you in a sea of scales[if scalevalue of player > 4], even despite your large body[end if]. With the enchanting eyes no longer able to dominate you with your dark prison, your senses return, only to be subjugated by the serpent's touch. All that you can hear and feel are the sliding scales as they grind against every inch of your body, overwhelming your weakened state with a flurry of sensations. And yet, despite the rough treatment, a few moans escape you as you can't help but find the caress of those smooth scales pleasurable.";

Your helpless form is easily spun around and around, and you quickly lose all sense of direction in the crushing darkness. There seems to be no meaning or reason to you being tossed about, and you begin to wonder if she was actually toying with you. After what seems like forever, there's a shift in movement as some of the coils squeeze down on you while others slip away. You gasp for fresh air when your head is released back into the outside world. However, the rest of your entire body remains trapped in the coils, and right in front of you are those captivating eyes as they capture your attention once again.";

Up close, her dazzling eyes dominate your vision, their enchantment drawing you in even more than before. They seemingly radiate with some sort of otherworldly power, and it feels like that you're falling into those golden pools. 'You must be so weary from your travels,' the scaled charmer croons, her sweet voice drowning out everything around you until it and her gaze are all that you can focus on. 'Just relax. You are safe in my embrace. Take a deep breath, let out all of your stress. Every time you breathe out, empty your mind of all distractions.' You oblige your captor without thinking, and as you breathe in and out, you feel your thoughts, your worries, and everything else melt away. Soon, there is nothing left in your head except adoration for your serpentine mistress, and all you can do is gaze at her with a dopey grin.";
				say "     'Excellent. Just listen and obey my every word,' the snake commands. 'It feels good to let everything go and let me do all of your thinking.' You nod dumbly, accepting her words without question. Being held in the snake's coils makes you feel safe, and you can't help but trust her as you stare into her warm, inviting gaze. 'Such an obedient pet. You belong to me now. That means I get to do whatever I wish with you.' Again, you nod without any hesitation, and the serpent leans even closer, her large, humanoid tongue flicking across most of your face with one swipe. 'And what I wish is for you to be my delicious little morsel, to become a part of something far greater, and nothing gives you more pleasure than serving me.'";

You don't struggle at all when the ravenous maw descends upon you. Her coils relinquish you into her gullet, plunging you into darkness once again, but this time in a much more humid environment. Effortlessly sliding into the enormous predator, her insides welcome you into their embrace, pressing into you from every angle. You hear a satisfied hiss before it's drowned out by a symphony of squelches and gurgles as you are pulled deeper, all while the surrounding flesh continues to knead you. The walls constantly constrict you, and yet, the snake's interior feels strangely pleasant, even erotic, as they rub against your weary form.

Before long, you achieve your second release with a loud moan. Even then, your lust refuses to go down, and you yearn for more. Unable to do anything but submit to your body's uncontrollable need and the snake's stomach, you go through climax after climax until you eventually pass out in a whirl of pleasure and exhaustion.";

'Finally awake, are we?' the giant reptile says as she pulls you into her gaze. 'Surprised that you're not still inside of me, melting away in a haze of pleasure? While I do find you to be delectable, I have a better use for you. I am Savina, but you may call me Mistress. I saw your battle with that flying brute earlier, and I can make use of your combat prowess. In return for letting you go, I want you to find other morsels and bring them to me. And because I enjoy playing with my new pet, I shall even sweeten the deal by satisfying your carnal desires between tributes. I'm sure that you'll find my offer [italic type]irresistible[roman type].' You shiver as Savina's eyes seem to glow and pulse with power for a moment, and as her words sink in, you nod automatically. With your compliance, Savina smirks deviously and lets her coils slowly slip off of you.

Her golden eyes, however, are her most striking feature, and even from a distance, you find your gaze often drifting to those captivating orbs.

When only the very tip of the massive tail is all that remains in your ass, you barely have a moment to catch your breath or dwell on the aching void that had been left in you before Savina drives her tail back into you in one smooth motion.

	say "     Exhausted by your back-to-back releases, you go limp, allowing yourself to be fully taken by Savina as her voice rumbles from all around you, saying, 'You are simply delectable, my pet. Far more exquisite than the common rabble that you bring me. I'm so tempted to keep you inside of me and make you mine forever, but alas, you are far more useful doing my bidding rather than serving as a one-time meal, even if you would make for a divine feast. For now though, I suggest that you get comfortable. I fully intend to savor you fully before I let you go.' You find no issue with Savina's plan, and even if you did, it's not like you can do anything about it. All you can do is feebly squirm while you are pulled through the endless tunnel of flesh. With nothing but the squelching sounds of your surroundings and the ever-present sensation of her stomach walls kneading into your weary body, you relax into your mistress's embrace until you eventually pass out in bliss.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     When you come to, you are lying on the forest floor. You shiver from the cold, both from the spittle covering you, as well as you missing the warm confines of the snake. 'Did I tire my pet out again?' Savina teases as her head moves into your view. 'I can't help it since you're so delicious. Do come back soon, whether if you're bringing me back another treat or offering me another taste of your delectable self.' As you get up and clean yourself off, Savina watches you with a hungry gaze, and you can't help but think about being inside of the giant snake once again.";

	say "     'I think that you could use a little more obedience training,' Savina says, bringing you even closer to her face until her golden eyes completely encompass your vision. 'Now, pay attention. Your mistress is speaking, and you love listening to my angelic voice. After all, you are my obedient pet. I give you pleasure and safety, and all I ask in return is for you to obey my commands. Trust me, love me, obey me.' You nod automatically as every single one of the snake's enchanting words resonates in your mind, binding your devotion to her. Savina grins at your blind worship, and her coils shift to let her tail brush across your entranced face. 'Such a good pet. Just keep listening to my voice, and you'll get a treat from your mistress,' the serpent says before giving you a single squeeze, making you groan, not out of pain, but out of pleasure. 'You enjoy being held in my embrace, to let my beautiful scales caress you.'";
	say "     Again and again you are squeezed, but not once does the reptile hurt you. Instead, you feel safe and comfortable within Savina's grip, trusting your mistress to take care of you. Your faith in the snake is so great that you don't worry at all when her tail wraps around your head, submerging the last part of you in the twisting coils. 'There you go, my pet,' Savina's voice reverberates within your cocoon of scales. 'Every squeeze you feel puts you deeper into my control, pushing out your thoughts. Let your mind be emptied of everything except your loyalty to me and the endless pleasure that I give you. Within my coils, you are safe from danger, experiencing nothing but pure bliss.' You moan wantonly, awash in a sea of ecstasy, as the supple walls constantly rub into your helpless form, the euphoric sensations of snakeskin massaging every inch of your body amplified by the darkness of your scaled confine.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Savina's honeyed words and irresistable touch overwhelm your feeble mind with pleasure, driving you to your climax[if player is male] as Savina smirks at your cum leaking out of the cracks of her coils[else if player is female]as Savina smirks at your juices dripping from the cracks of her coils[end if]. And yet, despite your release, the coils continue to slide across your body, the smooth scales exciting your senses and reigniting your lust for Savina's sensual touch. Unable to resist your mistress, she wrings orgasm after orgasm out of you, and you revel in her dominance over you. You are Savina's pet, and nothing brings you more joy than letting the snake use you as she sees fit.";
	say "     Eventually, the marathon of pleasure comes to an end when the coils slowly recede, but as soon you lose the support of those strong muscles, your exhausted body crumples to the ground, much to Savina's amusement. Despite being sore all over, seeing the satisfied look on her face after using you brings you solace as you rest under the watchful eye of your mistress. By the time that you're finally able to get back on your feet, the snake's hypnotic hold on you has faded, but even though your senses had returned, the bliss that you felt within the cocoon of scales lingers in your mind, already making you crave for Savina's touch once again.";

'Good [if player is male]boy[else if player is female]girl[else]job[end if],' your mistress says as her tail gently drags down your cheek and ends with a few scritches under your chin. Even though the giant snake is treating you more like a housepet, you cannot deny the wondrous touch of her scales, nor the pleasure in hearing her praise.

Just relax and let me welcome you into my embrace. Soon, you won't have to worry about a thing.' The captive slowly nods, and they barely flinch as Savina closes in on them with her hungry maw wide open. The serpent envelopes the entranced prisoner in her mouth, easily slipping her meal inside of her as she hums in satisfaction.";

You gulp as well, the scene somehow fascinating and even a bit arousing, and you intently watch the bulge that is the prey slowly travel down the serpent's throat. 'Rest now, my sweet,' Savina coos, rubbing the wriggling figure with her tail. 'Let yourself sink away in bliss as you become a part of something far greater.' You cannot take your eyes off of the figure as it moves through your mistress, and a part of you even wishes that you were the one under all of those scales and powerful muscles instead. Eventually, Savina's snack finally disappears somewhere in the mass of her thick coils. 'Simply divine,' the sated serpent says as she turns her attention back to you. With a smirk, her tail wraps around you, pulling you close to her face so that you get lost in those golden eyes of hers. 'You did a wonderful job, my pet. Now, it's your turn.

However, they don't get far when a wall of scales crashes down right in front of them, blocking their escape. 'Now, now,' Savina chides. 'There's no need to run. I merely just want us to have some fun.' Another loop of the snake's coils moves, this time aiming to drop right on the runner. With nowhere to go, Savina's prey desperately puts their hands up right as the coil lands on them, and they actually manage to hold up the serpent's body, but with how small they are compared to the enormous snake, it's obvious that Savina is holding back. 'Let's play a game,' Savina croons with both seduction and mischief. 'If you can manage to hold me off for a full minute, then you are free to go. If you can't, well...' She chuckles darkly before smiling devilishly at the trapped person. 'Let us begin.'";

Time seems to slow to a crawl as you watch the victim's strained movements and ragged breathing, a clear sign that they were using all of their strength. The victim manages to keep Savina at bay for almost the entire fateful minute, but just as the last few seconds tick down, a lazy shift in the coil bearing down on the prisoner instantly smooshes them into the ground. There was no contest at all. Savina had been toying with her prey the entire time.";

But instead of eating them, Savina drops her snack in the midst of her coils, and it only takes a second for the poor soul to be lost in the sea of shifting scales.
