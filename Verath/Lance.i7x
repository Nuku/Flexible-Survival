[ Updated scenes and dialog - Stripes ]

"Adds a npc to Flexible Survival with a variety of responses and goals..."

section 1-  Lance


Lancetalk is a number that varies.

Lance is a man.[or woman]
The description of Lance is "     Leaning against the bar casually is the lithe avian form of the black swan you rescued from the clutches of the hyenas.  He is now dressed in a loose black studded outfit, with lots of extra buckles, and his new beak already sports several piercings, which jingle slightly as he bobs his head to the loud music happily.".
The conversation of Lance is { "Honk!" }.

the scent of Lance is "He smells like an avian male with the scents of gay sex clinging to his feathers.".

instead of conversing the Lance:
	if Lancetalk is 0:	[first time you encounter the npc text]
		say "     'Thanks for the rescue,' the black swan you saved says with a smile.  'I had been holding out for a while, but you arrived just in time.'  Lance pats your shoulder with a feathered hand and looks over to where his brother is sitting in the booth, watching the two of you.  'I already thanked my brother earlier.  I understand he sent you out there to help and wanted to come himself.'  The swan smiles fondly before glancing around the club.  'I'm definitely grateful he decided to check up on me this time.  And it looks like he set himself up with a nice place to hang out in too, the lucky bastard.' Lance says with a soft chuckle as he bounces his flexible head softly to the music.  'Nice people here too, loving the eye candy...' he says as he looks you up and down with a grin before his eyes stray to where a familiar looking black swan stripper is currently hanging from one of the poles.  'Yeah I think I could definitely get used to this place...' he says with a smile as he snags a drink and leans back to enjoy the music.";
		increase Lancetalk by 1;
	otherwise if Lancetalk is 1:	[Normal short messages the npc will say each time you talk to them]
		say "     [one of]'Hey thanks again!'[or]The black swan just lifts a glass at you with a smile as you wave at him.[or]Lance is too busy staring at the gyrating ass of one of the strippers to pay attention to you.[or]'You treat my brother alright, ok?'[or]'You know, being a hyena might not have been that bad, but this is damn awesome,' he says as he gestures at the busy club.[or]'You would make a great little pony for my bro.  Why don't you go let him play with you some more?' Lance says with a grin.[or]'Hey, it's my rescuer!' Lance says as he lifts a glass to you, before grinning and saluting the stage.  'One of my rescuers anyways,' he says as he shoots you a wink as he watches the dancing swan's ass rub against the pole.[at random]";


Instead of fucking the Lance:
	say "     'Sorry, I'm grateful to you for all you went through to help me out,' Lance says with a grin on his new beak as he nods at you happily, 'but I think I had better stick to just one type of infection for now.  Just to make sure it sticks,' he says with an amused nod and glancing over at the other swan dancer and winking.  He turns back to you and snickers, gesturing at Tristian.  'Besides, I think you make my brother a much nicer companion, don't you think?' the swan says as he nudges you towards your handsome stallion.";


Lance ends here.
