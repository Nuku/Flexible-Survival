section 1-  Lance


Lancetalk is a number that varies.

Lance is a man.[or woman]
The description of Lance is "Leaning against the bar casually, is the lithe avian form of the black swan you rescued from the clutches of the hyenas. He is now dressed in a loose black studded outfit, with lots of extra buckles, and his new beak already sports several piercings, which jingle slightly as he bobs his head to the loud music happily.";
The conversation of Lance is { "Honk!" }.

instead of sniffing Lance:
	say "He smells like an avian male with the scents of gay sex clinging to his feathers.";

instead of conversing the Lance:
	if Lancetalk is 0:	[first time you encounter the npc text]
		say "'Thanks for the rescue,' The black swan you saved says with a smile 'I had been holding out for a while, but you arrived just in time.' Lance nods at you in thanks before looking over to where his brother is sitting in the booth and watching the two of you. 'I already thanked my brother earlier, I understand he sent you out there to help and wanted to come himself.' The swan shakes his head fondly, before glancing around the club, 'I[apostrophe]m definitely grateful he decided to check up on me this time. And it looks like he found himself a nice place to hang out in too, the lucky bastard.' Lance says with a soft chuckle as he bounces his flexible head softly to the music. 'Nice people here too, loving the eye candy...' He says as he looks you up and down with a grin, before his eyes stray to where a familiar looking black swan stripper is currently hanging from one of the poles. 'Yeah I think I could definitely get used to this place...' He says with a smile as he snags a drink and leans back to enjoy the music.'";
		increase Lancetalk by 1;
		stop the action;
	if Lancetalk is 1:	[Normal short messages the npc will say each time you talk to them]
		say "[one of]'Hey thanks again!'[or]The black swan just lifts a glass at you with a smile as you wave at him.[or] Lance is too busy staring at the gyrating ass of one of the strippers to pay attention to you.[or]'You treat my brother alright ok?'[or]'You know, being a hyena might not have been that bad, but this is damn awesome.' He says as he gestures at the busy club[or]'You would make a great little pony for my bro, why don[apostrophe]t you go let him play with you some more?' Lance says with a grin.[or]'Hey its my rescuer!' Lance says as he lifts a glass to you, before grinning and saluting the stage, 'One of my rescuers anyways,' He says as he shoots you a wink.[at random]";





Instead of fucking the Lance:
	say "'Sorry, I[apostrophe]m grateful to you for all you went through to help me out,' Lance says with a grin on his new beak as he nods at you happily, 'But I think I had better stick to just one type of infected for now, just to make sure it sticks,' He says with an amused not, before snickering and gesturing at Tristian, 'Besides, I think you make my brother a much nicer companion don[apostrophe]t you think?' The black swan says as he nudges you towards your handsome stallion..";
