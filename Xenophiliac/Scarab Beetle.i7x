	now face entry is "an almost-exact replica of a Scarab Beetle. The lower half of your head is occupied entirely by your mouthparts; small appendages surround your actual mouth, which is also flanked by a set of thick, jagged mandibles, capable of slicing through flesh and bone. A set of fluffy antennae protrudes from your head, twitching wildly as you absorb all the smells and senses around you. Your eyes lie near the upper part of your head, off to the sides. Unlike human eyes, they're now compound, insect eyes, entirely pitch-black";
	now body entry is "resembles that of an insect. Your two sets of arms are made up of five individual segments, the end segments terminating in jagged, plated claws. Your legs are similar to your arms, also made up of individual segments, but they end in a flatter, hair-covered foot more suitable for walking. Your back is quite large, a chitinous shield now protecting a set of wide, translucent wings. Since your transformation, your skin has taken on a glimmering [one of]emerald-green[or]sky-blue[or]lavender-purple[or]golden[or]bronze[sticky random] tint, shining beautifully in the [if daytimer is day]day[else]moon[end if]light";

	now face change entry is "it begins to transform! The lower half of your head swiftly reshapes itself; the entirety of your lower head soon being replaced by an insectoid mouth, a set of impressive mandibles surrounding the mouthparts of a beetle or grasshopper. Two large, feathered antennae suddenly pop out from your head, twitching and turning of their own volition. Your nose shrinks into your head, rapidly disappearing; your sense of smell is now being maintained by the antennae. Your vision rapidly flashes and adapts as your eyes enlargen and shift position; your eyesockets cease to exist as your pitch-black compound eyes move to the sides of your head. Your head finally settles down, now resembling the head of a beetle";
	now body change entry is "[BeetleBodyChanges]";
	now skin change entry is "it writhes and seethes strangely, ripples coursing through your rapidly-changing skin. It seems to be reshaping into large sections, divided by small indentations into your skin. Soon, your skin stops moving, but rapidly begins to harden, thickening into a hard carapace. Soon enough, your skin resembles that of an insect; a scarab beetle, to be exact";
	now ass change entry is "odd popping and shifting happens internally"; [?]
	now cock change entry is "it begins to change and writhe wildly, strange feelings accompanying the changes. Your shaft begins to shift into segments; soon enough, five individual segments now make up your cock, covered in a hard chitin. Dull ridges along these segments conclude at your cock head, sure to provide even more pleasure to any potential mates";

to say BeetleBodyChanges:
	say "all of a sudden, your figure begins to reshape itself, bones and tissues changing and elongating as time goes by. Your arms and legs slim down and extend, reshaping into five individual segments, insectoid in nature. Your feet quickly change into an insectile foot, the bottom of it covered in tiny, sensitive hairs and the entire thing terminating in a large set of spiky claws. Soon to follow are your hands, which change in almost the exact same way as your legs; the palm of your hands now covered in tiny hairs, while your fingers have merged into three large digits, ending in a bug-like claw.";
	say "Soon after your limbs change, your body follows suit. Your back cracks and extends out quickly; you feel a thick set of protective coverings form from your shoulders, growing down to cover your new, translucent beetle wings. Small nubs form below your arms; these soon grow out into a smaller, but nonetheless deadly, pair of arms. Finally, your body ceases changing, leaving you with the form of a beetle";
