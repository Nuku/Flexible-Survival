Andromeda	"Andromeda"

Andromeda is a woman.
Description of Andromeda is "     The bubbly owner of the store stands behind the checkout counter, looking around with a curious, innocent look in her eyes. Her tall, fuzzy ears swivel around constantly, taking in every sound echoing throughout her establishment and keeping a lookout for trouble. Wide green eyes peer out from her face, with her slightly-protruding muzzle graced by a constant bubbly smile. Night-black hair flows down to her shoulders, a dark contrast to the rest of her face. Roving your eyes down from her face, you see that her body is covered in short, dark-orange fur, with occasional splotches of gray interrupting the constant orange flow. Contrary to many of the denizens of this city, Andromeda is not at all voluptuous, the ripped shirt she's wearing barely showing her breasts while her slim stomach does nothing to dissuade her lean look. Her thin legs and hips are covered by a pair of denim jeans, faded and worn with years of use. Her long, furry tail flicks back and forth excitedly, almost knocking loose knick-knacks on the floor. Her (probably) pawed feet are currently inside a pair of tennis shoes, old and worn, with one missing a lace. Finally noting your roving eyes, she says 'Hey, eyes up here you!' all while giving you a good-natured smile and sticking her tongue out at you.";

Conversation of Andromeda is { "I'm a cat!" }.
the scent of Andromeda is "     Andromeda smells clean, obviously taking care of herself, but she has been unable to rid herself of the distinct undertones of [italic type]cat[roman type]."

Throughout the tour, Andromeda bounces happily, continuing to bombard you with every question imaginable, and some even unimaginable. You do your best to answer as many of them as you can, but the onslaught is relentless, and a few of them go unanswered. Not that that seems to bother her. In between questions, the bubbly catgirl makes small talk, talking about the weather or what your opinions on fish are. You can't seem to figure out how someone so cheerful still lives here.";

Thinking to herself for a moment, she lets out an audible [']Oops['], as if she'd just remembered something important. 'As much as I'd like to, I can't give away this stuff for free. Limited supply right now, as I'm sure you know. Thankfully, I have an friend that introduced me to new sort of currency. She works for Zephyr and they have been helping out with some of the supplies in exchange for these [']freecreds['].

Wait a sec,' she says, cutting herself off as she rushes to the back. The catgirl returns shortly with a small leather jacket with red and pink trim and a high waistline. 'I got this in with a shipment of other stuff, but didn't have a chance to send it back. Something with a bare midriff like that is too trashy for me to sell to a little girl. A larger version might look pretty sexy on the right woman though,' she adds with a soft sigh as her eyes glaze over. You wait awkwardly for a bit, but it soon becomes clear she's lost in her imagination. With a shrug, you take the unwanted jacket, hoping Gobby will be satisfied with it.";

Chatting a bit about everything that's going on, you can't help but have your mood lightened from the girl's constant bubbly mood. Having exhausted most of the small topics you've thought of, you eventually broach the subject of how she got her shop, and she thinks to herself a bit before responding.";

While I did alright in all of my other classes, the art classes I took always excited me, and from there, I took as many different art classes in college as I could. I loved painting, drawing, all of that stuff. Being able to think of new ideas and put them on paper, or taking something in life and immortalizing it in paper is a great feeling, one that is hard to describe to people. But, although I love being artistic, I soon found out that it wasn't a very lucrative occupation then, especially for someone starting out. So I took a look at what I could do for a living, while still doing what I really enjoy. I took a look at a lot of opportunities, but none of them interested me very much. I figured I'd end up doing something I hated, but a friend of mine mentioned fashion designing. I hadn't even considered that!' she yells at you, not waiting for you to recover before continuing. 'Researching into it, fashion design was actually really cool. Being able to think out ideas and patterns for clothes that people around the world wear is so cool! It also allowed me to keep drawing and sketching, which let me to keep doing at least a part of what I enjoy.'";

I sent them all of my ideas and designs, and after like a week of nervous waiting, I got a message back saying they wanted to use some of my ideas, and extended a possible job offer to me. Me! Someone online who sent them ideas out of the blue! I was ecstatic, and I couldn't wait. Their headquarters was stationed here, so I had to come up here once to interview. I passed with flying colors, and they had me move up here. Working as a designer, and doing well at it, gave me enough excess cash to rent out this,' she extends her hands out, obviously meaning the small store, 'space here, and set up my own little shop. While I didn't get much business at first, people liked the few of my designs that I had on display, and enjoyed having their own locally-owned boutique. Soon enough, I had business enough to turn a tidy profit, and I was able to keep on goin['].'";

That is, until everyone changed and now all they do is try to hump you. No appreciation for the finer things in life now!' Andromeda [']harrumphs['] as she says so. Idly wondering to yourself, you ask her if she has any of her personal designs on display.";

I think I packed most of my own stuff in the back. I want those saved for when this all blows over.' Andromeda smiles at you, seemingly finished with her story. You're about to interject with another comment, but a stag-morph coughs loudly behind you, carrying a pair of jeans and a simple shirt.

Looking around the empty store, it seems she's not anywhere in here. Shrugging to yourself, you figure you'll come back later. Preparing to leave, you barely catch the almost-silent snore from behind the counter. Going back to checkout, you slowly lean over the counter, and looking down, find an interesting sight. It seems that Andromeda has fallen asleep, her back leaning against the side of the counter and legs folded under her. Smiling to yourself and getting back up, you can't hold back the quiet chuckle that escapes your lips at the sight. That seems to have been enough to have woken the catgirl, however, because you're barely turned around before you hear a familiar 'Hi!' echo from her usual position. Turning back around, Andromeda's familiar happy-go-lucky smile is looking your way. Chuckling to yourself once again, you inquire as to the reason for her 'catnap'.";

Seeing as how no one was around, it wouldn't be a harm to nap real quick. It has been worse since I changed though. Guess it comes with being a cat!' she proclaims loudly, thought you think she's still blushing. Changing the subject to avoid her any more awkwardness, you ask if she'd be comfortable sharing how she changed.";

I was working here on a slow day, putting a guy who bought something through checkout. Can't remember what he bought... Anyways, we were in the middle of checkout when there's this BIG commotion outside. The guy at checkout asked me to hold his purchase and ran outside to see what was going on. Nothing happened for a few minutes, and I'm waiting behind the counter, when the same guy runs back in, except he was growing fur! I had no idea what happened or what was going on, so I freaked out and bolted for the storage room. I didn't know if he was going to attack me or something, and I didn't want to take that chance. If I hadn't have run...' Her mood darkens a moment, and she visibly shudders, from fear rather than joy. 'Anyways, he managed to grip my leg, scratching down my leg as we both tumbled to the ground. I flipped over and just started kicking wildly. One of my kicks must've landed in his face or something, because he let go of my leg. I didn't look back as I ran into the storage room, locking it and hiding there.'";

Andromeda twirls around and does a little flourish, showing off her new body. 'Not that I mind that much. Who would've thought that being a cat would be so cool! Anyways, after I had transformed into a cat, and once everything had calmed down, I took a step outside. Everything LOOKED the same, but it wasn't until a few of the mall rats came in that I realized that this thing might be bigger than I first thought. I haven't gone outside the mall yet, but some of the rats tell me that it's worse outside.' You nod, confirming the mallrats['] observation. 'Well I guess I got lucky then. I can't really complain about being a cat.' She thinks a few moments. 'I'm more surprised that my shop is still running, honestly. I would've thought everyone would've lost interest in clothing, but it still seems that people want new attire. Or at least, replacement attire.'";

'Hate to be a downer, buuuuttttt I'm gonna have to kick you out for now. I gotta get back to my beauty sleep. Gotta keep appearances up,' she says to you, grinning cheekily the entire time, and blushing just a bit.

This digit soon buries itself into your cunt, joining its twin in their exploration of your cunt. You do the exact same thing, adding a third digit to the two thrusting in and out of Andromeda's now dripping cunt.";

She responds readily, the two of you making out while your fingers are buried in each other's cunts. Confirming your suspicion, you're soon wracked with an orgasm, brought on by Andromeda's skilled fingers. You moan heavily into her mouth as you cum, your feminine juices drenching her hand and the floor below. Lost in a sea of pleasure, you continually jackhammer your fingers into her spasming cunt, mindlessly trying to make her cum. Your wish is soon granted, with the feeling of her cunt gripping your fingers and a river of fluid drenching your hand. Mewing loudly as she cums, she breaks the kiss and pants heavily and sags into your grip. You do the same to her, both of you holding onto each other as you recover. Both of you recovering after a few minutes of rest, you withdraw from each other; your hands are covered in each other's fluids. Licking herself clean, Andromeda takes your hand and cleans it, watching you lustfully as you gather your things. Cleaned up and ready to leave, you're pulled into an aggressive kiss by the normally-bubbly catgirl, her tongue catching yours in a sensual embrace. Breaking off the kiss, she gives your ass a playful slap and tells you to 'Come back soon', the sentence punctuated by a throaty purr. You do your best to remember to visit again as you walk contentedly out of the shop, prepared for whatever is ahead.";

She eagerly complies with your kiss, moaning quietly as you begin to fondle her, running your hands through her short, soft fur. One of your hands finds her small A-cup breasts, and you begin kneading her breast and lightly tugging her nipple. You remove your other hand, and commence stripping yourself, slowly removing all the clothes you can get off with one hand and setting them aside. Finally breaking the long, lust-filled kiss, Andromeda is filled with arousal, furiously masturbating and panting heavily. You remove your hand from her breast, giving it one last tug, with a groan being the result, and make a show of removing the rest of your clothes. Watching you intently with wide eyes, Andromeda absorbs every inch of your body, obviously turned on even more by the show. Quickly realizing that she is still dressed, Andromeda rips off her clothes and throws them haphazardly on a crate nearby. Her tight slit is revealed, dripping and running lubricant down her thighs. You're not far behind her, you yourself beginning to feel a heat all over your body. Not wanting to wait anymore, you tell the catgirl to lie down on her bed, moving yourself atop her as you do so, finding yourself face to face with Andromeda's womanhood. She finds herself in the same position, with your cunt hovering right above her face.";
				say "     Finally finding yourself face to face with the perky girl's slit, you run your fingers over the catgirl's vagina, deftly massaging her folds and tugging lightly on her clit. A pleasured moan is the result of your teasing, and this moan quickly turns into a high-pitched screech as you dive a digit into her spasming cunt. While you begin to finger the spasming woman, you shake your ass slightly, signaling Andromeda to start her own playing. You suddenly feel her hands on your hips as she forcefully pulls your slit to her face, giving her uninhibited access and making you gasp loudly. Pangs of pleasure shoot through you as Andromeda immediately dives her long tongue into your [cunt size desc of Player] cunt, the rough appendage scraping on your inner walls and eliciting moans of pleasure from you.";

Immediately pushing your wriggling tongue into her inviting folds, you're drenched in the taste of her feminine juices. Exploring Andromeda's depths is brought to a quick halt when her rough tongue hits a truly sensitive spot, triggering a moan from you, muffled as your mouth is currently occupied. You quickly dive back in, savoring the smell and taste of the lithe catgirl. Your reentrance does not go unnoticed; hearing the girl groan into your cunt is all the confirmation you needed. You quickly forget how long you and Andromeda have been at each other, constant waves of pleasure having eroded all of your other senses. Lost in the overwhelming sensations of her tongue caressing every inch of your depths, you barely notice when Andromeda lets out a loud mew, her fluids exploding all over your face in a long, exhaustive orgasm. Your own climax is not far off, and you find yourself groaning loudly into her slit as your own feminine fluids drenches her muzzle. You sag down, exhausted but sated, sighing loudly as you feel Andromeda dutifully licking your juices off of your pussy (and her face). Rolling yourself off of her and climbing next to her, you cuddle up next to her and rest your head, feeling her rough tongue cleaning your face off. You soon drift off to sleep, lulled by the feeling of Andromeda hugging you.";
				say "     You wake up some time later, still in the comforting embrace of the fuzzy catgirl. You slowly get up and gather your things, being careful as to not wake her. Unlocking the door and stepping out, you're able to faintly hear Andromeda telling you to 'Come back soon, beautiful.' Smiling happily, you step out into the store, ready to go on your way, the faint smell of cat hanging over you.";
