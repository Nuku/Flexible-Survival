From the glances you can see, it looks as if the emblem resembles the carving on Amuran's sarcophagus; a circle with two majestic wings protruding from its sides.

A few glass cases still remain unbroken, displaying simple artifacts with little seeable value. Pieces of broken glass and pottery line the floor, the current occupants of the Museum obviously not concerned with historical preservation. To the east lied a passage further into the Egyptian Wing, but a recent collapse has blocked off that hallway. Further ahead, what looks to be some sort of large artifact lies in the passage ahead, heavily peaking your curiosity.

		say "     The northern mural, most likely being the first in the set, is your first target. Looking over it, the left of the massive painting is taken up by a large man sitting on a throne, staring regally ahead. You immediately recognize the seated man as Osiris, the Egyptian god of the dead; both the husband of Isis and the father of Horus. Dressed in exquisite, regal garb and wearing a magnificent crown, he is portrayed as the pharaoh of Egypt and the benefactor of the Egyptian people. Strangely enough, instead of illustrated with green skin, signifying his death, Osiris is instead depicted as a living man, not yet having met his fate.";
		say "     On the other side of this mural, under the watchful gaze of Osiris, the people of Egypt bow before their rightful pharaoh. Men, women, and children kneel down in front of his throne, giving themselves over to the rule of Osiris. This mural is obviously depicting the time when Osiris was the ruling pharaoh of Egypt, bringing forward an age of prosperity for the empire of the Nile.";

The other man, standing behind Osiris, can only be Set, the god of violence and chaos. Tricking Osiris into getting into a wooden box, Set seals Osiris within it, filling the box with lead and throwing it into the Nile. Set brutally ends the reign of Osiris, Set's jealousy having proven the victor.";
		say "     Searching throughout Egypt, Isis, the wife of Osiris, hunted for his corpse; she finally finds it embedded within a wooden pillar within a palace along the Phoenician coast. Removing the coffin of her husband, she finds Osiris dead, Set's violent methods having killed the king of Egypt. Reciting a spell of revival, Isis brings Osiris's body to life, with the subsequent intimate relations resulting in Isis's insemination. Her spell soon wears off, and Osiris once again dies.";
		say "     Continuing the story on the right side of this mural, you see Isis hiding Osiris's body somewhere in Egypt, away from the wrathful vengeance of Set. Retreating herself into the desert, she soon births a son; Horus, lord of the sky. Set, having found out what Isis had done, hunts throughout Egypt for her and her son. Stumbling upon the body of Osiris, Set flies into a vengeful rage and tears his body into pieces, scattering them across Egypt.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Wandering over to the final mural, you can tell that the finale is still before you. Already having raised Horus to adulthood, Isis once again travels through Egypt, collecting the dismembered parts of her husband. Reconstructing Osiris's body and mummifying him, Isis prepares Osiris for the traditional burial of the Egyptian people. Watching her dedication to Osiris, the rest of the Egyptian pantheon admires her love of Osiris; together, the pantheon resurrects Osiris, who thusly becomes the undead god of the underworld.";
		say "     The end of the mural illustrates the conclusion of the conflict between Osiris's family and Set. Horus, having grown to manhood, goes forward to fight Set. The two of them fight, their blades crossing rapidly and violently. Eventually, Horus gains the upper hand, and soon overtakes Set, besting him in combat. Having beaten his enemy in combat, Horus avenges his father and takes over rulership of Egypt.";
		say "     You come out of your thoughtful stupor, having finished deciphering the giant scrolls hanging from the walls. Your mind occupied in contemplation of the story you just read, you stand there a few more moments, your thoughts wandering through the knowledge of Egypt you possess. Soon enough, you figure that you should continue your exploration; there may be more things to learn of that residing within these halls.";
	else:
		say "     Putting your mind to the task of deciphering these paintings, you use all of your knowledge to try and figure out what these walls say. However, despite all of your thought, you are unable to make any progress on finding what these murals say.

Walking around the pool of water and up to the shining coffin, the sarcophagus is even more glorious up close. While it looked made of plain gold from afar, the sarcophagus is actually inlaid with multitudes of precious gemstones, many of which you're unable to name. Alongside the gemstones, you're able to tell that the sarcophagus is not made of just gold; strings of different-colored metals run beautifully across the coffin's surface; it looks as if the metals are actually flowing. You can't begin to comprehend how much money this thing is worth to the right person; selling it would make you exceedingly rich.";

Checking delicately along the seal of the sarcophagus, it seems that the lid is latched on at a few points around the coffin; it would be a (somewhat) simple matter to unseal this sarcophagus.

The only way you could describe it is as a humanoid insect; some sort of hybrid beast. Stepping back a few steps, you take a few moments to examine the strange creature, trying to figure this beast out. The creature's legs look to be made out of individual segments; four or five separate segments, if your estimations are correct. The bottom segment ends in large, flat claws, well-suited to both attacking and walking. Its chest is covered with a thick carapace, with small impressions dividing up parts of it; this creature seems to have a thick exoskeleton shielding its body. Any part of its body that's covered by this exoskeleton shines a magnificent green; it's like the creature is carved from a massive emerald. You're presently unable to fully tell what it has on its back, but you think that this creature also sports a grand set of wings, similar to its smaller brethren. Two sets of spindly arms extend from its shoulders, one set right below the other, and both currently crossed over its chest. These limbs are almost carbon-copies of the beast's legs, with four or five segments ending in claws. These claws, however, look closer to normal hands, albeit built for an insectoid.";
		say "     It begins looks even stranger as you continue to examine the beast. Atop the creature's short neck lies an insectile head, easily the strangest part of the strange beast. Occupying the lower half of the creature's head is a malicious set of insectile mouthparts; you recall from a few nature documentaries that they can be extremely painful to humans, and fatal to smaller prey. Protruding forward from the front of its head, above its mandibles, is a long set of feathered antennae; these seem to be roughly two feet long, jutting out prominently in the sun-lit air. More to the sides of its head lie what you presume to be its eyes; large black orbs stare ahead, entirely devoid of any color.";
		say "     You take a few more steps back, letting your brain process the sights you're seeing. This whole experience is incredibly surreal to you; golden riddle doors, a beautiful sanctuary inside the city, a humanoid bug inside a sarcophagus. You've no idea if there's some mystical force at work here or if you've just gone completely insane. Looking at the large creature inside the casket, you're entirely unsure what to do with the thing. Leaving it here out in the open seems like an incredibly bad idea; who knows what kind of sex-crazed creature could come stumbling in. Sighing to yourself, you look at the lid laying on the ground, reluctantly figuring that you need to reseal the sarcophagus. Leaning down and bracing yourself against the ground, you pick up the cover and subsequently almost fall over; it feels light as a feather! Once again chalking this up to magic or other things beyond your comprehension, you lift the lid easily and place it next to the coffin, preparing to line the lid up with the casket.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You're entirely unprepared, however, when an emerald blur slams directly into you, knocking your breath out with tons of force. Finding yourself thrown back to the ground below with a chitinous hand at your throat and a green body atop yours, you're not sure if surviving is in the cards for you. You quickly surmise that the creature inside the sarcophagus was, in fact, not dead; it's clearly alive, if the solid black eyes staring at you are any indication. Keeping you still with one heavy hand, the creature above you (presumedly) looks you over, long antennae twitching wildly above you.";

Feeling the grip around your throat loosen slightly, you hastily explain yourself, saying that you were just exploring and happened to come across the sarcophagus.";
		say "     Once again becoming silent, the creature above you looks to be contemplating your answer, thinking through the whole situation. With the low thundering sound that the creature's voice seems to consist of, it once again speaks, responding to your explanation.

With a low sigh and a heavy grunt, the insectoid above you deftly rights itself, releasing you in the process.";
		say "     'There is no deceit within you, mortal; you are not the blasphemer that must be hunted.' With that, the insectile man dismisses you, apparently done talking for now. Slowly, you get up, watching the strange creature carefully, in case it changes its mind. Gathering your scattered equipment, the creature meanwhile languidly explores its surroundings, looking and examining everything around as you prepare to leave.
