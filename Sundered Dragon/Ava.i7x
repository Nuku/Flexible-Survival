	if "Breeder" is not listed in Traits of Ava:
		say "     Standing a solid twelve feet tall when on all fours, Ava's margay taur body easily dwarfs many of the infected you've encountered up until this point. Her gentle citrine colored feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Much like the margays at the state fair that she likely descends from, Ava's humanoid torso is generously endowed with a sextet of P-cup breasts capped by soft pink nipples, with a huggable fluffy paunch. Her humanoid arms, decorated in adorable rosettes, have a pleasing amount of pudginess to them. Ava's hands meanwhile appear mostly sapien in design, small barely noticeable black pads are visible on her palms. Strangely or perhaps not so strangely instead of finger nails, Ava has tiny partially concealed slits on the tips of her fingers housing her long claws.";
		say "     Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body. To the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of domesticated feline though markedly larger. Her furry paws, comparable in scale to dinner platters, appear built more for stalking prey than out right chases, a reality her thunder thighs heartily second. Her undercarriage mirrors her anthro half having six evenly proportioned M-cup breasts tucked between her legs. Sneaking a quick peek at her supple ass, you notice Ava has a [one of]seemingly bottomless[or]canyon-like[or]cavernous[or]expansive[or]elephantine[or]titanic[or]person-swallowing[at random] cunt. Strangely, her plush pink nether lips though unerringly large have a rather human appearance to them. Tied in a bow around the end of Ava's billowing tail is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's log stamped on the corner.";
	else if "Breeder" is listed in Traits of Ava and Libido of Ava is 0:
		say "     Measuring in at a lofty twelve feet tall when on all fours, Ava's margay taur body eclipses the majority of the mutants you've encountered to date. Her gentle feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of Egyptian royalty and cast upon a pelt of yellow amber, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Her anthro half largely resembles the hefty cats in the state fair and is graced by a collection of six plump P-cup breasts topped by perky pink nipples. Since ingesting the transformative cocktail created by Dr. Medea though, her lush body now sports a set of six smooth hairless tendrils growing from her shoulder blades. From experience, you know she has complete control over them and has slowly begun incorporating their use into her day to day life. Her humanoid arms meanwhile are decorated in adorable rosettes and have a pleasing amount of pudgy softness to them.";
		say "     Ava's hands appear mostly sapien in design, with small, barely noticeable black pads visible on her palms and fingertips. Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, instead of finger nails, she has tiny partially concealed slits on the tips of her fingers housing her long retractable claws. Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body, and to the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of domesticated feline, though markedly larger.

Her gentle feline eyes are wide and expressive that never fail to bring a smile to your face regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her catty face is at once both exotic and innocent. Having been knocked up after one of your recent escapades Ava's already plump anthro half has gained a pleasing amount of mass. Her anthro womb is starting to bulge out into a slightly spherical shape. Despite the early stages of her pregnancy her breasts have already swollen to inhumanly large R-cups that fight each other for space. Flushed with raw rich cream, her uppermost milk tanks rest comfortably atop her growing tummy. Were she some manner of pathetic lowly biped, her lower four breasts would sag against her waist. Due to the elastic nature of her skin, her weighty mounds retain an impossibly shapely and perky disposition despite their size."; ["Four legs good! Two legs bad!" Johnny Bravo, probably]
		say "     Still, their heavenly mass wobbles enticingly with her every motion, promoting your lovely playmate to employ a number of her tendrils as a living bra. The rest she uses to mitigate her growing mobility issues caused by her hyper attributes. From what you've seen, she is quite adept in finding uses for them. Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body. To the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of a slightly pregnant domesticated feline. Her large furry legs at times seem to struggle with the growing mass of her feral tummy pushing against her P-cups, but she doesn't seem to mind the mild mobility issues. If anything she seems quite happy to use her condition as an excuse to be lazy or pamper her growing body. Not that you can blame her, her distended stomach looks rather cute the way it sways down past her knees and the adorable sight of her milky dugs brushing her well-seeded middle fills your heart with no small amount of pride with the knowledge you've successfully knocked up such a beautiful tauress.";

As her pregnancy advances, you notice her blushing pink human-esque nether lips have grown ever thicker as a thin trickle of dew leaks from the gravid tauress's fertile flower as her hormonal body is enhanced by the effect of her condition. More than once, you've found yourself distracted by the sweet scent of her simmering maternal desire. Spouting from her fecund flank is Ava's incredibly long prehensile tail. Lighty tied in a classical bow near its terminus, is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's logo stamped on the corner. Hidden beneath the dense layer of fur coating its tip though is her ovipositor slit. Normally invisible to all but the most perceptive of individuals, your enhanced senses can easily pick up the subtle coiling scent of feminine desire emanating from the exotic appendage.";

Her gentle feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Having been thoroughly knocked up after one of your recent escapades Ava's already rather plump anthro midriff has grown into a glorious taut chubby dome. Swaddled in a thick layer of soft adipose and silky fur, her resplendent tum droops down almost to her knees. Despite her size and constantly soaring weight, the sheer volume of amniotic fluid sloshing inside her combined with the size of your kittens, and the gentle support of her tendril, her plush tummy remains perfectly spherical at all times. Looking closely, you just about make out the blushing pink outline of a cute outie navel beneath her glossy fur.";
		say "     Her already sizable breasts have gained a few more inches, swelling to monumentous T-cups. Her uppermost laze happily along the supple shelf of her growing tummy. Supported by the valiant efforts of her tendrils, Ava's remaining upper breasts frame her well-seeded tum in a jiggling ring of bountiful excess. Flushed with fatty cream, her perky nips hardly need even the slightest bit of stimulation to express. Far from embarrassed by this, Ava seems to take a bit of pride at the light waterfalls of alabaster milk leaking from her chest. A part of you takes a measure of solace in knowing your kitten will be well-fed when the time comes, you can't help but admit you wouldn't mind trying some of her mothers milk too. Perhaps you should [italic type]milk ava[roman type], the next time you're feeling parched. Thanks to their size, Ava's assets completely block her view of anything below them. At this point she's almost completely dependent on her tentacles to support her growing girth, much less waddle around The Chance.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Not that she seems to mind, the hormone-addled cat girl is quite enamored with current state as she spends more and more of her time petting her plump curves and caring for your gestating brood. More than once, you've heard her humming to your kitten, or encouragingly massaging their slumbering forms. Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body is dominated by her growing midriff. To the casual observer, her feral portion resembles a comically gravid house cat's. Her thick furry legs can barely support her blossoming stomach and can hardly even fit around the heavy swollen thing as her kitten-bloated belly sways perilously close to the ground. Her animalistic dugs have grown into weighty P-cups, she has to support with her tendrils lest they drag on the floor. Not that Ava cares about her near total loss of mobility, if anything she seems to embrace her broodmother proportions. Despite her encumbrance, her glowing fur is kept immaculately clean, even her claws are sharped to the keenest of edges and seem to shine with some bountiful inner light.";

Even the slightest breeze is enough to elicit a pleased little purr or desperate quiver from her as she struggles with ever-building lust. Spouting from her fecund flank is Ava's incredibly long prehensile tail. Lighty tied in a classical bow near its terminus, is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's logo stamped on the corner.

		say "     Slipping through the partially closed garage door, you find yourself face to face with the garage's feline occupant. Tauric in nature, they would be around twelve feet tall when standing all fours. Their head initially reminds of an average house cats, yet their wide Brobdingnagian eyes and unique facial markings speaks to them more of a nocturnal predator than some lap animal. Adding a measure of credence to this assumption is their luminous pelt, yellow and white with miniature rosettes sprinkled throughout. A feature only present in the designer savannah cat people created some years ago, leopards, ocelots, and... margays! Bingo, you opine mentally patting yourself on the back as you connect the taur's coat with the plump cat girls at the state fair. A hefty creature, the taur's anthro half supports a husky frame with six P-cup fun bags.";
		say "     Fused to their waist is an equally fluffy lower body built in the order of a predatory feline's. Their digitigrade legs have a healthy amount of padding that almost obscures their set of developed calves. Fighting for attention between their legs is another set of six thirteen-inch breasts. Swishing behind them is a billowing tail coated in rings of gold and burnt ebony. Wrapped around the end of this appendage is a small baby blue blanket. She, you realize, is solely female observing her lack of male equipment. Quite the rarity given that most of the tauric Panthera you've encountered tend to be inter-gendered. Then again, she's genus Leopardus after all, but that's neither here nor there.";

		say "     Her room is sparsely furnished with a faded brown rug, a cobbled together futon, and an old davenport being the sole amenities. The floor, though relatively clean in that there are no bits of dirt or hair laying about, has a good deal of loose paper has been scattered. All of which have random portions expertly cut out. Most of the walls are bare, yet in the rear, you can see what you believe to be the beginnings of a collage made out of old reading material. Or it's her scrapbook collection minus that whole book part. Which would make it more of a scrap wall? You muse as the tauress justifiably interrupts your train of thought.";
		if Player is Male: [Male or Herm]
			say "     'Uh-um, h-h-hello there, does Dad- I mean Drake know you're here?' She stammers with a nervous light in her eyes as she backs her rump against the wall as if to keep her backside as far from you as possible. Wanting to put her at ease, for you doubt you'd get much in the way of conversation from her otherwise. You inform the tauress that Drake asked you to stop by. 'That's a relief,' she sighs, looking a little calmer, yet she keeps her hind end away from you. 'Oh, my name is Ava,' she adds awkwardly, eyeing you as one would a dangerous animal.";
		else: [Female or Neuter]
			say "     'Oh hi there, sorry I didn't hear you walking by, or I would have tidied up a bit. Please just give me a second to clean up.' The tauress says in a demure embarrassed tone as she hurriedly sweeps the loose leaf paper into a pile with her tail. Explaining to her it's alright, you inform the tauress that Drake asked you to say hello, not inspect her living arrangements. 'Right sorry, I didn't mean to say you were, not that you couldn't if you wanted to. Or that you should, I mean,' she shakes her head sighing. 'My name is Ava, nice to meet you,' she says in a much more even tone. In reply, you give Ava your name telling her likewise, which puts a cute catty smile on her face.";
		now HP of Ava is 1;
	else if HP of Ava is 1:
		say "     Having never encountered a Margay Taur before, you ask Ava how she acquired her current form. 'Huh,' Ava tilts her head, 'I've been like this,' she says looking at you like you've just asked her if fire was hot, water were wet, and the sky were blue. Flabbergasted, you inquired when that was. 'I am not sure, let me think,' Ava props her left hand under her chin. 'Actually, now that you mention it I don't know when I was born.' Your curiosity peaked. You decide to ask Ava if she perhaps remembers where she was born. 'Mmhh,' Ava nods, 'it was this weird place called the State Fair.' Feeling like you're getting somewhere, you inquire as to why she left. Reasoning that as far as you know, most margay infected don't leave the fairgrounds. 'Oh, I was looking for my mommy and daddy.' Ava replies as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Finding this an odd response, you point out since she's part margay, wouldn't one of them be her mother. 'Maybe except other margays don't like me, I tried talking with them, really I tried my hardest, but they would hiss and growl at me saying I was [']too big['] or [']not right[']. The other creatures were just as bad, always chasing me, stealing my food, or trying to shove their gross cocks in my face,' Ava says, audibly gags and looking a little green in the gills.";
		say "     '*Cough* sorry about that,' Ava covers her mouth, 'I got really queasy. So I left, I thought maybe I could find my daddy out in the city. Maybe he and I could look for mommy at the fair. I never found him though,' she says, tucking her chin into her bosom and sighing. You ask why she came to The Chance then if she was looking for her family. 'This,' Ava flashes a blanket with The Chances name tied around her tail. 'I've had it since I was a kitten. I don't know who gave it to me though, but it's all I've had to go on,' she says, crossing her arms as if she were cold. Wondering what happened next, you ask her how her search went. 'Bad,' she peeps, 'most of the people I meet either ran away or tried hurting me. Sometimes I could get them to go away if I gave them my food and water but... not always.' You ask her if she ever fought back. 'Once, but it didn't feel good.' Cocking your brow, you ask if she could be a bit clearer.

I remember my head started getting really light and hot like I was always standing in the sun all the time then... I-I think I got chased out of the city or maybe I left on my own. My memory is kind of fuzzy but I know at some point I ended up in the plains. It wasn't that bad since the... ferals? I think that's what Drake calls them, out here didn't bother me but they didn't talk to me either. So, I, um sort of wandered around until I got lost after this stinky rain washed out my trail.

It was probably one of the most frightening experiences I've had. There was just something about his expression that said I was less than a bug to him, but then, I saw Kathy standing him clutching her tummy as she hid behind Drakes['] leg. I realized what they were, a mommy and a daddy. For a second I thought they were mine, wait that's not true.' She mews mournfully. 'I wanted them to be mine but... they aren't.' Ava whimpers. Wondering how things went from there, you inquire if Ava was able to learn anything about her family.

'A little bit, but I am not so sure anymore,' Ava says, furling her ears. 'I mean if my parents actually cared about me why was I abandoned? But Drake and Kathy, they listen to me.

She's already turned you into a mini version of herself without trying, maybe you shouldn't tempt fate.

I'm starting to get sore again,' Ava purrs, giving her heaving bosoms a shake for emphasis.

'Flatterer,' she blushes, nibbling on her pointer finger, 'I'm glad you like the [']new['] me. These tentacles are amazing!

Her lovely pink toes shine like diamonds in the available light while her portly legs are held in a lurid delta which naturally summons the eye to her pleasantly plump pussy, while her tail waltzes about her in a ballet of sensuous need as her billowing furry ovi-tail fans her desperate scent about you. 'Ha-ha enjoying the show, my sweet mate?' Ava coos, resting her paws on the taut dome of her lower body as she massages the verdant mass with her forpaws. Nodding dreamily, you tell her yes, very much. 'Good, because I love what your kittens do to me.

A part of you just can't get over how right these changes have come to feel, as you run a hand through your luminous pelt, blithing at the sensation of the supple fur coating in its tender protective embrace. It's becoming harder and harder to see yourself as anything other than the cuddly kitten you've come to resemble, you ruminate, kneading your powerful talons against the mattress beneath you, enraptured by the tactile resistance of the fabric hugging your claws.

The thought of proudly displaying these rosy stfeaks fills you with a bit of eclectic energy as you return the gesture, lightly braising your talons along her pliable hide. Meanwhile, you press your frolicsome snout against her alluring meaty pad, desperate to hilt as much of your oral muscle within her as your body can manage, and tighten your grip upon her hindpaws. Warmth floods your muzzle as her hungering walls snatch and grip at your probing laps as if they can somehow coax you to climax while your lover rumbles like a well-tuned machine at each heady motion. Her lustful trill grows from a fine mewling purr to a proud animistic roar of release as one final convulsion surges through her supple body as she finishes.

Your kitten's tendrils still rove and pamper you in a base show of affection that your savage side approves of as you make a show of audibly smacking your chops. Mh, delicious as always, you rumble, running your hand over the sweet balmy swell of your cum-flushed middle. 'Th-thanks I-I'm glad,' she stammers, her voice and expression distant and dreamy as she stretches out her many limbs in a catty display of contentment. Aw is your girl tired, you tease, as you drape your upper half over her lower body and playfully heaving sides. 'Yes, kitty sleepy, but happy,' she yawns, 'say can-can we please cuddle for a bit before you go, please? Kitty, kitty wants to be held...' Ava mews, as her eyes flutter shut as she starts drifting to sleep beneath you.";

Your muzzle sinks ever-so-slightly into her furry chest pillows while your paws lovingly massage her lengthy core as this shared moment stretches on. The concept of time and its passage hold little sway over you, suns could rise, moons could fall, shadows can stretch and recede. Yet, only the tender purrs of your mate, the low sloshing of her milk tanks, and the sensation of her pelt intermingling with yours holds meaning to you as you lie there warm and safe beside you mate. This provincial bliss is short-lived though, as your wanderlust builds, and the nagging call of obligations sinks its uncaring claws into the recess of your mind. Perhaps sensing the conflicting tension, Ava cracks open her eyes, and fixes with a knowing look, whispering, 'It's alright.

Even if you may not fully believe her, any relations with infected persons always has the potential to lead to mutations. At some point, you have to take a degree of responsibility for your own actions, and Ava didn't force you to do anything.

All things considered, Ava spontaneously becoming infectious is one of the more banal things you've probably encountered. 'Hm, I guess you're right.

Looking around, you notice the nearby traffic lights wink on and off like dying Christmas tree lights as the city's failing transit grid putters away the last remaining watts of power as if they were the last waning breaths of some great wounded beast. Here and there you spy the husks of wrecked cars littering the area, some are burnt to the bone. Going by the holes pockmarking blackened hulks, their fuel were ruptured by small arms fire levied by the last stand of the city's police, an attempted spoiling action by the military, or panicked resistance of well-armed locals, you can't be sure. Others are torn up by tooth and claw as if their owners were either pulled from them by aggressive mutants. Occasionally, you notice the luckless car who's canopy has been crushed by some variant of a larger infected creature. Others still are muttered in an oily sheen of dried white flakes of what you assume is cum, or spittle as these same creatures attempt to slake their own hungers upon them.";

That doesn't explain why the place hasn't been looted as you can still make out the outlines of a couple dozen rows of neatly stacked junk food, behind the cashier stand. No way looters and entrepreneurial survivors akin to yourself wouldn't have tried to sack it at the start of the outbreak. There must be something guarding it or some kind of contamination warding the locals away. The possibilities are numerous, shapeshifters, psychics, clever fliers waiting in the wings, or tiny infectious items tainting the area, it could be any of these, or all of them. Still, curiosity gets the best of you as you tiptoe about the periphery of the artifice. You're careful to avoid the ubiquitous bits of trash and shredded appeal lest a clumsy foot fall crunch an errant sliver of glass, or jostle the odd filth encrusted article of clothing littering the city.";

Inside, you spy the sleeping form of wolverine guard curled up in the tattered remains of their uniform. It doesn't take a genius to tell this person was much smaller once based on their current size compared to their uniform. Though the fact they've held on to their clothing and even made some effort to crudely patch a few holes suggests they may still be slightly sane. This presents you with a rare opportunity to try talking to them, if they're not nuttier than a squirrel in a peanut factory. You can just ask them if you can buy a few things. There are enough wallets, purses, and murses scattered around the city that you could probably put a down payment on a house with all the loose change.

If you had a way to deal with them at range, you might be able to pick it off from a distance, or skirmish with it. Since you don't, you'll need to be a little creative. You muse, surveying the environment for anything that can give you an advantage, there certainly is tons of scrap laying around after all. There must be something you can use to extend your reach, you think to yourself, quietly appraising the debris in the immediate area. Once your eyes pass over a massive rod of steel slag sticking out of the back of a broken down truck. You think you may have found what you're looking for. Heading to the wrecked vehicle, you brush through the broken concrete and assorted bits of metal that was likely destined to become another layer of landfill somewhere.";

Indeed, you'd probably throw out your back or shred your palms trying to swing this massive hunk of iron repeatedly. However, if it's just once... well you don't have to be Atlas reborn to pull that off. Hefting your iron slab, you walk up to the edge of the kiosk and whistle as loud as you can. Simultaneously winding back your weapon, you wait for the wolverine to stick its head out. You don't have to wait long, as the mutant is roused from its slumber. With a feral growl its pokes neck out just past the lip of the structure yelling, 'Who's there! What's that noise!' [one of]Hey you![or]Over here![or]Hai yo![or]Heads up![or]Batter up![at random]";

It collides square on with the mutant in a resounding yet somewhat satisfying *CLANG*, that reverberates through your body as metal deforms on impact into facsimile of the creature face. Still they seem to absorb the impact, and for a moment, the two of you are stuck in place staring, until it lurches forward awkwardly like it were trying to make a grab at you. Only to collapse over the side of the kiosk, as its goes cross-eye and it falls face first into the cement with a loud thud. Doing a quick double take to make sure no one noticed you brained the wolverine. You find the area is still clear, and set your deformed weapon next to the pacified creature.

Instead, you content yourself with looting a fat haul of junk food, soda, and as many magazines you can fit in a paper bag from the surrounding area. You even spot a bunch of wallets laying around the area that still have money in them. Going through them all you wind up with a couple hundred American, a stack of euros, and what may as well be colorful play money to you due to how little it's worth from various island nations. You know, now that you think about it, Ava might like the prettier ones. Sure, currency destruction is a crime, but with all that's going on right you doubt anyone will care, you muse.

Folding them up, you walk over to the counter, you lightly rap your knuckles on the metal surface of the counter. At the sound, the creature begins to stir, as a single bloodshot eye pops open. It fixes on as its pupils shrink to murderous pin-pricks as its warped mind tries to parse your existence as it leaps to its feet. 'Wa, who, what do you, what do you want, mutant!?' it shrieks, baring its teeth at you, spittle dripping from its lips as it looks you over.

With each convulsion, you can see the seams fray and patch begin to rip as the wolverine struggles against its nanite-borne impulse to guard this place no matter the cost. Ya, don't think they're coming back anytime soon, can they ring you up? You have cash. You ask in a droll tone, flashing a fist full of dollars. The creature blinks, a look of confusion written on its bestial visage as the fragment of its human personality wars with its nanite influence. It almost looks pained as it stares at your money, for a moment as the rusty hamster wheel in its head turns a degree. 'We are the middle of a coin shortage, so I can't,' the creature snarls biting its own lip till a trick of blood drips down their chin, 'make-make change is that ex-axe-acceptable Mx?' You shrug.";

'Paper bags only, Cali-California has banned plastic bags and,' The wolverine bleats, grasping hold of the counter as more violent tremors rack the mutant's body as they struggle to hold itself together. 'That will be $35.73 please know the bag tax is ten cents in this city. Also d-d-due to the pandemic, you will not be able to return these items.' Whatever, you tell them, keeping your expression vacant and placid as you place the exact amount on the counter.";

Still, the addled person somehow manages to collect your money despite the tremors rocking its hulking form as it pockets your payment.

You can't think of any others that could reach several stories off the ground and bend steel like pipe cleaners.

You then think about angling your shot, but haven't really had the chance to figure out the rate drop of your weapon is at this distance. It would also put the magazines at risk, you realize not wanting to ruin them with blood splatter or potentially frenzying the wolverine. While they may not be the most dangerous infected out there, they are not total pushovers either, it could make a lot of noise if it went looking for you and who knows what manner of attention that could bring.

That's it, you muse breathing out and squeezing the trigger. With a *Pop* and *Thud* your round hits  square in the temple, slamming the wolverine's head to the pavement with the force of impact.

Well, you begin, you were there recently and, you pause to open up your inventory then pull out a bundle of magazines. You got these for her, you tell her, handing the tauress the first batch. 'You did! I can't believe it,' Ava stammers, her eyes go wide with delight as she sizes up the covers on the nature magazines. 'You actually found these, but I uh...' Ava mews mournfully, her ears drooping as she shifts her weight between her paws nervously and sets the magazine down on her davenport. 'I can't accept these.' Wondering why, you ask her how come. 'I don't have anything to give in exchange. Daddy says it's not fair to ask people for help, and not repay them for it.' Shrugging, you inform her you were never expecting to be reimbursed, that you did this out of the goodness of your heart. Besides, you found plenty of supplies there you wouldn't have known about without her tip.";

Tittering, you explain its money from other countries and that you thought she might like a few. 'But they're so pretty, aren't they worth a lot, are you sure I can just have them?' Ava asks, eyeballing the large denominations emblazoned on them. Eh, not here, most of these are worth a nickel, maybe less, economics are funny like that. You tell her, handing Ava a small stack of brightly-hued bills. 'Really,' Ava contends holding up a Caribbean note. 'They're so colorful though, I mean look at the blues on this one.

When I did, he started acting a little weird and he said had to clean something up really-really badly, then ran off,' Ava peeps, stifling a sniffle.

'Right,' Ava begins, tapping an erratic tattoo with a toe claw on the cement as she looks around the room. 'The walls, what do you see looking at them?' she asks, bobbing her tail against a barren stretch of wall. Shrugging, you tell her matter-of-factly tone you see gray polished cement peppered with black stone as aggregate and the occasional chem stain.

Ava says pointing to the ground by your feet then turns to the entrance. 'There are patches of vermillion and brown specks by the doorframe where someone slammed their hand, their print is still there too. I know it's not Daddy's. His hands are much bigger and the sweet smell reminds me of mommy, but the shape is wrong.' She says, motioning to the doorway. 'When I look in the corners, I can see a sheen of olive oil colored stuff pooling where somebody did their business once.' She remarks, though a mild shudder passes along the ridge of her feral spine. 'When I look at sunlight or moonlight I see these motes of vibrant purple and waves of metallic blue auroras that look like the picture of seafoam Drake showed me once.'";

Your whole body shines a brilliant bright blue like it's covered in-' Ava, never mind, you think you've heard enough. You interrupt, not wanting to hear any critiques of your post-apocalyptic hygiene. 'Ok,' Ava nods. 'Thank you for this though, these will really help with my project.'

Not that Kathy minds the stimulation or shows any signs of discomfort as her plush tummy squirms in her arms. Judging from the lewd grin on her as she pampers her lush midriff, the fecund breeder is getting off a bit on the sensations of litter prodding her insides.

A part of you can't help but feel a spark of maternal pride at the sight of the fruitful beast you've grown into. Your nanite-warped mind delights at the sight of fur-swaddled breasts and the sensation of the thick calorie rich milk sloshing within.

A part of you doesn't even mind slowly losing sight of the ground, or your paws as your condition progresses. It's such a small price to pay for the joy that motherhood brings you after all, you opine, running your padded palm over the silky pelt protecting your anthro pouch. Turning your gaze further south, you can't help but grin at the sight of the pillowy gold and black fur swaddling your animalistic womb nestled neatly between your legs. Not to mention, the heady spectacle of your feral dugs that mirrors the decadent portions of your anthro half.

At least now you can give them something soft to touch, you think yourself, trying to massage your resplendent body. Despite being the size massive saucer plates that they are, your paws can barely reach around the pliant adipose belly cradling your tauric young.

Yet your tauric body takes it in stride, if anything your body might be enjoying the sensations.

Without meaning to, you can feel your claws flex and tail fans your warming sex as pangs of desire tease your sensitive form.

But, you muse listening to her content purring, you trust Ava to know her way around someone's kitty. Ava doesn't disappoint either, she kisses and suckles your inverse clit with loving precision as her nose buries itself in the plush tissue of your lush pelt. Cold to the touch, you let out a cute peep as her snoot ruffles your downy belly fur. You can hear Kathy's restrained giggle at your cry, but Ava doesn't seem to hear you, lost in her task.

Sadly, the vast majority see you as little more than a waddling baby factory or an unwilling transmission vector. Given your current state, you can't say you're been doing much to discourage such sentiments and in the case of the former might not even object to being used as such. The fact that Ava still takes the time to pay attention to the rest of you though is still a rare and welcome pleasure, you opine as the gentle tauress's paws roam your lower body, kneading and massaging knots you never knew you had.

You know what she's planning, but you don't even have time to contemplate consent as Kathy roughly spears herself on your muzzle. In the blink of an eye, her plump muff and thick thighs engulf your giant muzzle, smothering your senses with her gold fur, tender thighs, and the sweet scent of seeded lioness.

You feel more than see, Kathy pumps her plump feline snatch stretching over your predatory maw like it were her own personal toy. As her lush ebon cunt takes up more of your vision, you're thankful she at least takes it a bit slow, letting you sneak tiny breaths out the edges of your muzzle. Whether that's on purpose or due to her massive litter weighing her down matters little to you. At least you can breathe between Kathy's thrusts, and try to concentrate on your own performance.

You muse on this while riding out the waves of hormone-addled pleasure as Ava laps at your feral clit as if it were her own personal lollipop and beads of Kathy's fem cum drips down your furry chin. You know you wouldn't trade bodies with any man or herm. Pregnant sex is just too good, your nerves are just so wild and raw when you have all these wonderful hormones in your bloodstream.

Her short fall is thankful cushioned by your collective pudge acting as a natural mattress. Utterly sated, the purring tiny lioness snuggles her portly frame atop you, kissing and kneading your fur as your own climax approaches.

A part of you is more than a little glad not just for the chance to get off your paws for a moment, but also at the opportunity to lay on a real mattress again, rather than some stinky cot that's probably ninety percent asbestos and ten percent compacted dust at this point.

'See, that is how kitties['] paws are supposed to look, clean, fluffy, and with a nice tuft of fuzz in the middle.' She continues, in a chastising yet motherly tone that makes you feel a bit self conscious. 'Oh, sorry,' Kathy furls her saucer-like ears, 'that came out all wrong dear. I sometimes get a bit of, oh what does Drake call it,' she bobs her head thoughtfully, 'mommy brain?' Kathy says, perhaps picking up on your mood. Confused, you raise a questioning eyebrow to her and parrot the odd phrase. 'Oh you know, the urge to mother people and praise my wonderful, perfect little Ava here.' Kathy gushes.

It's not like everyone can just sit on their fat ass and ride out the nanite apocalypse with their fucking boi-toy sugar daddy waiting on them hand and foot.

Gazing down at your expansive body on full display before you, you can see your bloated wombs quake and jiggle with sudden activity. As a dozen little paw shaped bumps push against your supple body, it almost looks and feels as if your wombs are recreating a scene from a famous movie about aliens.

The pair works their fuzzy digits over your impressive collection of nips, kneading and groping your erect teats between their padded fingertips.

One part of you wants to see just how much Kathy can handle. Another is just relieved to shed a few gallons of cream if only for a few hours, before your overly productive body makes more. Though, out of the corner of your eye, you watch as the former showgirl, purring happily at your offering, tucks a sneaky tail between her thunder thighs. Your enhanced feline hearing picks up the soft sounds of her shamelessly playing with her lush feline sex while she chows down like a proper hedonist.

Ah this seems nice and ready now, you think to yourself guiding your tauric tail between your matronly nether lips. You can sense your plush pussy parting perfectly at the welcome intrusion while still hugging your tail like a living mold.

With a body like this, you tease, tracing a clawed finger along the delectable curve of Ava's prodigious mammaries, she needs to make sure her mate is the right size. She can't just go around with a puny litter of tiny latex foxes. She would barely even be able to see them under all her cute pudge, you joke pinching Ava's love handles. Maybe you can find her extra hung Wolftaur, knots are pretty amazing. Once she's ridden on a good one you doubt she'll ever want to go back. Plus, you bet she'd look adorable weighed down by a litter of cat-dogs weighing you down. You hear they're pretty frisky too. You tease. 'I-I um don't like guys or canines,' Ava peeps.";

Well not as big as the pair of you, you joke, patting Ava's animalistic flanks with your tail. But they've got these fat, pringle-can size dicks and huge fluffy black balls. Just imagine how precious her kittens would look as margay panthers? You ramble already imagining the fun you and Ava could have taking turns dominating a big sexy Panthertaur. '[Name of Player], I-,' She says, trying to cut in, but you talk over her as you're too lost in your own fantasy to fully comprehend her protests. Well if she doesn't like black cats, then the two of you can go to the zoo. They have these [']ladies['] called Tigertaurs there. They're like the Panthertaurs, but better, with lush milky tits, massive dicks, and they just fuck for hours on end. '[Name of Player].

It'd be a nice basic pregnancy for her, no kicking or squirming, just a bunch of quiet eggs nestled in your womb. True Orthas might not be able to lay enough eggs to give her a real bump like Kathy's, but everyone has to start somewhere. You proffer. 'That would be nice, I am not sure I'd want to be as big as you or mommy on my first try. Maybe you can introduce me one day?'

True, the nanites may handle things like morning sickness, and you don't have to bother with childcare, or the horror of diaper changing. However, your exotic body still gets a tad worn down from all the extra weight, giving you back aches at times. On top of that, you are always growing a few cup sizes with each litter. The first few sizes may have been fine, and maybe even helped with your body image. Now though, it's almost to the point where you're just ready to stop looking for new bras at this point and embrace the commando lifestyle. 'That doesn't sound fun, I thought you always seemed so happy when you're pregnant,' Ava says with a concerned look on her face as she eyes up your fecund form. Shrugging, you tell Ava that at times it's true, the pregnancy hormones definitely have that effect on you especially when you're horny. You occasionally also have a certain sense of pride at bringing life into the world, but there are a lot of little things about being a gravid taur that make life difficult.";
			say "     'Like what,' Ava queries, swishing her tail nervously. You inform her things like the occasional swelling in your joints you get after walking all day is one thing. The loss of mobility that accompanies your condition creates some of the bigger issues. You tell her, it can be quite difficult to maneuver some of the tight places in the city where everything is designed for [one of]tiny[or]meager[or]puny[or]lesser[at random] bipeds. You have to be on constant alert for narrow passageways lest you get stuck, or rough terrain that could nick your lower body. 'That does sound scary, I can't imagine what that must be like for you.

'What's heat,' Ava asks, cocking back her ears. Sighing, you try explaining the estrus cycle, the differences between the human and animal versions to her as well as how the nanites have overcharged it to aid in their propagation. That you routinely have to struggle not to seek out the nearest feline with a dick every couple of days, in order to quench the burning need the nanites force upon you. 'Oh you mean the tingle, dad, er Drake gave me something for that.' Ava replies, sauntering over to one of the tool cabinets and pulls out a bright pink circular pill container. Looking it over, you instantly recognize the design as generic birth control pills, like the ones schools or women's health groups occasionally hand out. You surmise Drake must be giving them Ava to keep her heats or [']the tingle['] as she childishly calls it in check.";

Already, you can almost entirely slake your thirst on your own supply, but when you're expecting your rich cream becomes even more nourishing and seems to improve your nanite-induced healing factor.

Hey babies didn't see you guys down there, you jokingly as you lift the weight of your gravid upper womb in your paws as if to confirm its existence. 'Huh, how do you not notice something that big?' Ava asks, tilting her head questioningly. Shrugging, you tell her you're not sure, the nanites sort of take care of everything, so you never really have to think about a pregnancy until it's time to give birth. Even then it's pretty tame compared to what people normally had to go through before. You just have to find a place to lay down then let nature take its course. In a few minutes, the kids are full grown so the whole affair it's really anything special, or difficult to you at this point. 'Are you kidding me? You really don't notice a thing.' Ava queries, poking your tummy.";

Or if you're waddling through a narrow door, then you definitely noticed the extra weight. It's not all bad though, you sort of like the way it feels when your body brushes against something soft, you simper, patting your plush feral womb with your forepaws. One of these days you wouldn't mind heading down to the beach and walking in the surf letting the soft sand cushion your paws, and the gentle cool waves lapping along your taut skin, you trill, running your hands along the supple length of your feral half.

You gush, placing a paw on your upper belly remembering fondly the encounter that left you in your majestic state. Getting to watch your body grow round and resplendent with life, and how your skin gets so sensitive. She has no idea how good it is just to walk around the plains, feeling those blades of grass ticking your distended womb and feral teats as your regal body sways delightfully with every step. Not to mention, the way it affects the rest of you.

You remark at the joys of watching your breasts getting larger and milkier with each bountiful litter.";

Everything just tastes and feels so good now. She has no idea how blissful it is just to have someone pet your fur or massage your paws. 'Really? Then can I, um, touch you?' Ava asks bashfully as she rocks back and forth nervously on her paws. Chuckling mirthfully, you tell her you'd be offended if she didn't. Go on, say hi, you joke, arching your back so that your pregnant belly sticks out more, gesturing for her to have a feel.

That was a kick right,' Ava gushes excitedly, as midriff squirms lightly at her touch. Yep that was, you gasp feeling the light quickening of your latest litter.

You get to watch men, women, herms, and creatures of non-specific genders drool over your big milfy body is incredibly affirming in some way. And you know what Ava? You ask, flashing her a toothy grin. 'What?' She replies. You have her to thank for it, this body is just perfect for you. You simper, as you stand on the tips of your toes and steal a quick kiss on her cheek. 'Oh,' Ava blushes, 'I really didn't mean to infect you, but I am glad you like the results.' You do, you purr contentedly giving your tummy a loving pat, and tell her you hope that answers her questions.

Purring at the touch of her meaty pads brushing up against your doughy tummy, you lean into her caress telling her you're never sure.

Still there's nothing like being a big preggy taur, you sigh with a note of maternal pride as your paw at the growing roundness of your golden waistlines. 'You really enjoy being a mommy, don't you?' Ava quips, seating her voluptuous form beside yours. Nodding, you tell her for the most part you do, but the nanites and this beautiful body she gave you really help out with that. You don't think you'd enjoy yourself anywhere near as much without it. Taurs and pregnancy just go together like chocolate and peanut butter, you answer, playfully groping at your soft fecund form.

I think I just felt one of their tiny pawbies push against my palm. Could you feel that too?' A little bit, you admit, it does feel kind of nice actually. It's almost like someone hugging you from the inside and out, you reply, gliding your feline digits over the lightly churning mass of your furry womb marveling at how big you're getting.

As your digits brush along the firm layer of amniotic fluid sheltering your kittens, you at last feel one of their tiny paws grabbing your cute toe beans, causing your heart to flutter.

'No what happened?' Ava answers, pausing her exploration of feral bump to glance at your wiggling anthro belly. Gesturing to your navel, you tell her one of your kittens just grabbed your finger.

It won't be long till it fully pops out into an even bigger and cuter outie you muse, playfully pinching a thick roll of furry pudge between paws before giving it a gentle shake whispering encouragement to your rumbling tummy. For a moment, nothing happens and the room is quiet, save for the low gurgle of your cub-stuffed womb and sensuous sloshing of your milk-filled tits. But perhaps responding to their mother's loving stimulation, your little ones perk up with a sudden flurry of activity.

Ava coos, gesturing to the tiny paw prints created by your quickening brood dotting your glowing pelt. Of course, you tell her. You've got plenty of padding for them, you add with a proud joking tone while giving your hips a hearty slap. 'Oh you're just the best!' Ava replies, running her sizable digits over the taut rim of your navel. Your little ones react to her touch almost at once. Their little paws all seem to gather around Ava's fuzzy feline fingers. You can practically see perfect indentations of their toe beans through the fur and adipose of your gravid taur tummy as they grab at Ava's digits.

You're like a giant plushie,' Ava quips more to herself than you as her kiss slowly transforms from gentle pecks to long sloppy licks as she grooms your bloated tummy fur with the sizable barbs of her feline tongue. Her free paws work their way down your animalistic sides, affectionately groping your bestial nips. Well, isn't that what girlfriends are for? Besides, it'd be unfair to keep all this to yourself, you serenade, jiggling a paw full of milky taur tit right under Ava's chin just to watch her flustered lustful expression as beads of pure white cream seep between your fingers.

				say "     'Excellent, I was hoping that was the case,' Medea chirps excitedly, as she rolls a pair of wheeled trays covered in all manner of medical paraphernalia next to you. A few items are easily recognizable like stethoscopes, sterile syringes, industrial scales, and, blessedly, a manual blood pressure gauge. The rest appear to be custom-made tools that resemble forceps, spanners, and spreaders of varying quality. Naturally curious about the good doc's work, you begin to ask them about it, but Medea cuts you off as she runs a scaled along the growing curve of your baby bump exclaiming. 'Oh my, you've been taking quite good care of yourself dear!' as her sleek paws gently prod the underside of your engorged furry womb. You nod, leaning into the cute lizard girl's touch, enjoying both the attention, and the pleasingly cool caress of her scales along the taut surface of your pelt. 'What an astounding process, it must feel amazing, and your current form seems to have taken to it quite well too,' Medea rumbles approvingly, running claws through your spotted silken pelt.";

'Oh and I see your little outie here is coming in nicely too.' She swoons, tracing her talons along the borders of your puffy naval, sending sensual tremors through your flush core as her claws lightly graze your sensitive flesh. 'Though you may be getting just hair on the plump side,' she snickers, giving you lush love-handles teasing pinch. 'But a bit of weight gain is to be expected, and you wear it quite well. Besides, I'll bet your little one needs all the nutrients they can get, and they seem to be growing rather rapidly too,' Medea notes, palming the equator of your gravid tum. 'In fact,' she coos, edging her sleek reptilian mitts along your [bodydesc of player] flanks, 'I'd like to take a few measurements, purely for, er, research purposes.'";

'Perfect!' she cries in a too eager tone as she grabs a bright yellow tape measure from her pile of supplies. She saunters up beside you and attempts to take your measurements. Though the tapeline barely makes it halfway around you, forcing Medea gets creative as she adheres several together with a bit of masking tape. 'My my, *huff* aren't you the big girl?' The overeager lizard coos with a flustered look on her muzzle and eggy core rubs against your spotted pelt, as she struggles to wrap her arms around you. Her slender form sinks into the [bodydesc of player] mass of your gravid figure as she pressed herself against you. The enthralling aroma of reptilian arousal teases your senses as her smooth egg-swollen middle rifles against your latest kitten. What can you say, must have been someone you ate. You tease, flashing the good doc a far-too-toothy smile, while you lightly paw at her tight curvaceous figure.";
				say "     'Uh sorry I didn't mean to...' Medea gulps, over the loud rumble of your stomach as she realizes how close she is to your drooling maw. You smell the fear and desire welling up inside her as your claws lightly graze her cool sleek vulnerable scalie hips, yet you push back against these budding instincts through sheer force of will, telling her no harm done. You're quite enamored with your present form, and you can't say you aren't a little curious either as to how big you are at the moment. '*Tsk* Unfortunately that's inconclusive,' Medea replies in a tactful tone, pulling herself away, 'your baby is growing, or, regrowing rather rapidly. Your belly already measures in at over over sixty nine cm, and climbing.' Nice, can't wait to see how big they get. Guess it won't be long till you make a proper tauress out of them yet. You coo, lovingly stroking your taut stomach fur. 'Indeed,' she purrs, enviously running her taloned fingers along the supple swell of her growing bump, 'say, do you mind if we try weighing the little one instead?'";

She zeros it and motions for you to plop you bump on the scale. More than a little excited to find just how heavy you've gotten, you grab hold of your portly mound, reveling in the weight of the thick layer of adipose and dense core of amniotic fluid swaddling your adopted child as they rest comfortably in your lush paw pads. With a low grunt, you gently heft the growing mass of your turgid tum just above the analog scale then gingerly lower your bundle of joy onto the scale, listening with no small amount of pride at the sound of the metal gears grinding under the weight of your little one. Oh that takes a load off the backs, you joke, waiting for the device to settle. All the while Medea's gaze darts between your burgeoning bump and the numbers as the machine struggles under your girth.";

She drones on for several minutes before jotting something down, saying. '.0003 grams seems to be the average.' Cocking an eyebrow, you ask what she means. 'Well weighing you little one is proving rather... difficult,' Medea says gingerly patting your fur, 'your upper belly alone appears to be gaining .0003 grams per minute, quite the growth spurt. Fascinating as the data may be though, this doesn't account for your lower half, or the initial weight of your adopted child.' She adds gesturing to bountiful curves of your animalistic half. 'Perhaps in the future we can find a few [']volunteers['] to weigh properly, assuming you aren't opposed to it.' She swoons, flashing you a lewd knowing smirk. 'Regardless, I must say the speed at which your body's able to reform others is remarkable even by infected standards!' She exclaims, as her tail snakes its way along the lower half, cheekily fondling the supple animalist curves of [bodydesc of player] form.";

'Really, so it's not just a feature of your current tauric form,' Medea says, scribbling something on her pad, 'then do you mind if I take a blood sample? I'd like to check what manner of hormones your body is producing, and see if I can find nucleotide or nano-mechanical marks left by your little one, then we'll discuss your friend's needs.' Shrugging, you tell her why not. 'Thank you, let me just get the supplies.' She says, sauntering over the back of her office, Medea roots through a series of draws pulling sterile and still in their package syringes, a felt pen, a handful of lab-grade vials, and a wad of cotton. She quickly scribbles your name plus the date on them and motions for you to place your arm on the counter beside her. Complying with her request, you do as she instructs.";

'Done, you can look now.' Medea says pressing a wad of gauze to your arm. Impressed by her skill, you tell her you hardly even noticed. 'Well, I've had a lot of practice on needle-phobic people. Now, you were telling me one of your partners had a question for me?' Right, you tell her that her name is Ava and that she was the one wondering if it were possible for two biological women to have a child. Considering her prior success in giving you the ability to unbirth others, you were hopeful she could somehow co-opt or adapt the process. 'Hm, well it is possible, I know of some foreign fertility clinics that were attempting a similar feat, and there are some rumbling in S.F. about groups looking to achieve the same results. I'd imagine it would be quite expensive, and I doubt they'll show results for the next twenty odd years.'"; [Author's note: Funny enough for the low price of 1 million USD same gendered partners can now have kids in S.F., was not expecting that when I first wrote this in 2012.]

				say "     Medea lets out an exasperated sigh. 'Right now, the easiest option would be some estosterogen pills, they're non-transformative and should allow you both to grow male genitals without compromising your female anatomy. I heard some were being tested in the city hospital before the cataclysm as part of some bluesky HRT project. I am sure you could find some there, or you could just bite the bullet and find a donor male or herm.' Shaking your head, you inform the good doc, Ava is a bit Agoraphobic and borderline misandrist at times, so that option is out of the question. 'Then I'm not too sure what I can do for her,' Medea replies, shrugging her shoulders. Oh come on doc, she's a dang fertility genius, she's made cunt pills, ovi pills, mpreg pills, learned how to give people control when they get pregnant, and even figured out unbirthing. This should be nothing for her! 'Well, ok maybe I do have an idea how to help,' Medea says, her scales blushing a light rosy red, 'but I need some supplies and better equipment.";
				say "     Fortunately most of what I need is in Trevor labs, however, the place was locked pretty tight before the outbreak, so I don't imagine you could just waltz into that place without a keycard, or staff member to show you around.' Not a problem, you tell her, you've been there before and have some knowledge of the layout. 'Ah then let me just get a list together of what I need,' Medea replies, swishing her tail towards a nearby brown metal file cabinet tucked in the corner of her office. For the next few minutes, the good doctor digs through various poorly organized drawers and overstuffed folders. Eventually, she seems to come across what she's looking for, 'Here we go,' she says, plucking out a number of manila file. She quickly skims them and jots a list of items on her notepad.When she's done, Medea rips out the page and hands it over for inspection. Looking it over it appears she wants: fresh fish from a very specific industrial canning facility in the warehouse district, a slew of exotic chemicals, and some equipment whose name has more umlauts than a page in the average German phonebook. Once you finish reading it over, you tell the good doc you'll get right on it. 'Excellent,' Medea chirps, 'and do be careful [Name of Player].'";

Replying in the affirmative, and not seeing the harm in indulging her, you waddle to up her and present your gravid midriff for inspection. Smirking, the pregnancy-obsessed scalie languidly brushes her clawed finger against the taut fur of your tauric tum saying. 'I can see you're taking very good care of yourself. Your fur is so wonderful soft and hm,' Medea rumbles, giving your love handles a cheeky pinch and watches as it snaps back into place, 'your skin still has plenty of elasticity to it despite your size.

Although, I can't help but wonder if a taste test is in order too,' she coos, with a needy look in her eyes as a few beads of opalescent excess dribble down her finger tips. Snickering, you cup your dominant padded-hand about one of your lush creamy teats, and offer her the chance to slake both her thirst, and her curiosity. After all, what better way to observe the effect of mother's milk, than to try some herself.

		say "     Well, I know of some foreign fertility clinics that are trying something similar, for those with the money,' Medea adds with an exasperated sigh. 'Right now, I'd say the easiest option would be some estosterogen pills, rather than attempting something so invasive. They're non-transformative and should allow you both to grow male genitals without compromising your female anatomy. I heard some were being tested in the city hospital before the cataclysm as part of some weird bluesky HRT project. I am sure you could find some there, you could just bite the bullet and find a donor male or herm.' Shaking your head, you inform the good doc, Ava is a bit agoraphobic and borderline misandrist at times, so that option is out of the question. 'Then I'm not too sure what I can do for her,' Medea replies, shrugging her shoulders. Oh come on doc she's dang fertility genius, she's made cunt pills, ovi pills, mpreg pills, learned how to give people control when they get pregnant, and even figured out UB. This should be nothing for her!";

Thankfully, much of I need is in Trevor labs, however I don't even know how to get in, supposedly the place was locked pretty tight before the outbreak. I don't imagine you could just waltz into that place without a keycard or staff member to show you around.' Not a problem, you tell her, you've been there before and have some knowledge of the layout. 'Ah then let me just get a list together of what I need,' Medea replies, swishing her tail towards a nearby file cabinet tucked in the corner of her office. For the next few minutes, the good doctor digs through various poorly-organized drawers. Eventually, she comes across what she's looking for. 'Here we go,' she says, plucking out a number of manila folders. She quickly skims them without showing you the contents and jots down a list of items on a bit of scrap paper. Looking it over it appears she wants: fresh fish from a very specific industrial canning facility in the warehouse district, a slew of exotic chemicals, and some equipment whose name has more umlauts than a page in the average German phonebook.

Reciprocating her greeting, you bring up Ava's question about the possibility of two biological women having a child together and if she might have the means to facilitate this. 'Sadly, no,' Medea replies, clicking her toe claws against the floor. 'With the pandemic going on, options are rather limited. Right now your best option is finding a donor male or herm, I am sure there are quite a few willing mutants in the city.' Medea quips, with a devious smirk. Shaking your head, you tell her Ava is rather set on having a kid with you specifically. 'Then the easiest solution would be to find some estotrogen pills, they should grant you both male anatomy without compromising feminine attributes. If memory serves, you can find them at the city hospital. I recall they were part of some experiential HRT program, but I don't know who ran it or why though. The A.P.A doesn't exactly recognize intersex dysmorphia as a valid mental disorder, yet.'";

Maybe when things blow over you check around and see what's in Ava's price range.' Medea shrugs. Really there's nothing she can do? You ask. 'Well,' Medea hums, tapping her muzzle thoughtfully, 'maybe but it won't be easy. Let me check some of my notes and I'll see what I can do,' Medea replies, gesturing to a nearby file cabinet. 'But I should warn, some supplies and need better equipment, hotplates and mess kits can only get you so far.

His faceguard awash with a soft blue light of his monitor as he tabs through pages of spreadsheets and background programs. Recalling the list that Medea gave you, and reasoning that since Matt is the last sane member of the research staff left, as far as you are aware at least, he might have some knowledge of where to find these items or at the bare minimum, point you in the right direction. With no other leads, you clear your throat to get his attention. Lost in his work though he doesn't respond, forcing you to rap your knuckles roughly on the glass. Shocked by the sudden noise, Matt leaps to his feet in a panic, knocking over his office chair. He grabs a nearby red staple gun and points it around the room frantically like it were a handgun as he swivels his head in blind fright looking for the source of sound with a terrified expression seared into his face. When your eyes meet, you throw up your arms in mock surrender, jokingly telling him to not shoot.";
	say "     At the sound of your familiar voice, Matt's expression softens as he loses a light chuckle. His gaze drifts from the stapler to the reinforced glass wall protecting him from the horrors of the outside world. The man appears to calm down a bit, and asks what you're doing here, stating that he's in the middle of some important tests that demand his full attention. Wanting to respect his work, even if you don't fully understand what it is, you then give him a brief censored version of events. Explaining how you're assisting another doctor studying various aspects of mutant reproduction and need some supplies from the lab. Nodding along, Matt, likely intrigued, asks to see the list in question. Flashing him the thumbs up sign, you press the list to the glass, and notice the light of recognition in his eyes as he reads off the items. 'Hm, under normal circumstances, I'd have to turn down such a request. However, considering all you've done to support the cause, I may know where these are, but,' he pauses to click his teeth, 'you'll need a keycard to enter that section of the labs.'";

	say "     'Give me a moment, I think there's a visitor's pass somewhere in here.' He says, motioning to the poorly organized clutter littering his campsite. He kneels down beside a pallet of sealed office snacks, his hazard suit squeaks loudly as if somewhere rubbing to over inflated balloons together as shift through the pile of supples. 'Ah, this should work.,' Dr. Matt remarks, as he pulls out a bright yellow keycard from under a pile of half eaten instant noodles that like their home to a budding colony of scoby cakes. 'The items you're looking for are in Isolation Lab Alp-69 sub-level 1, Access Point Primus. I would strongly recommend bringing a strong rucksack or a dolly with you if you truly intend to ransack the lab.' Why is that, you ask. 'Well the,' Matt pauses as he takes in long deep breath, 'Schäfer-Nägele-Göring-Köhne-Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff-Jorgen-Von-Strangle-Jager-Bombastic-Rothschild-Habsburg-Vandercunt-autonomous-exo-lab you're associate is seeking is powered by an advanced Stirling radioisotope generator.'";
	say "     Normally, we employ a forklift to move it, but,' he shrugs as he looks over your tauric figure, 'I'm sure your current form will manage it, somehow,' the doctor replies, as he plucks a lightly used napkin from his suit pocket and scribbles something that looks like directions on the back with a nearby pen. 'You'll need these too,' he says dryly, tucking both the card and napkin between his pointer and middle finger, then flashes his chicken scratch in your direction  'After the outbreak, a number of highly sensitive experiments were left... unattended far too long.' What sort of experiments, you query, naturally curious about what manner of hazards you may encounter. 'The need-to-know kind,' Matt grunts, causing the budding crows feet ringing his eyes to twitch ever-so-slightly in aggravation, though whether or not this sentiment is directed at you, or something else you can't say. 'All you need to know is that when containment failed, much of the lower level was damaged, and several passages collapsed in the resulting chaos,' he says, in a lighter tone, motioning towards a tab on his workstation labeled: Deadman's Hand Protocol.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Going by the last ping sent from the building's automated custodian, I doubt you'd be able to find your way in without them.' Dr. Matt adds, as he flicks open the two way airlock separating the two of you and places the note along with the keycard inside. With a quick practiced motion, he quickly punches in some manner of code, or command, you can't be certain from your current angle into the pad beside the airlock before sealing it, then waits patiently as the device cycles. Seconds later, a light on your side flashes green as the aperture hisses and opens, loosing a low pungent fumes of sterilizing chemicals. While he watches you pocketing both items, Matt loudly clears his throat to get your attention. '*Ahem* [name of Player], do be careful down there.' You tell him not to worry about it. You're a big girl and you can handle whatever is down there. 'I should hope so [Name of Player], you've been a,' Matt pauses, parsing his lips as if searching for the right word, 'passable assistant throughout the outbreak, your loss would be a shame,' then turns back to this work without sparing you another moment's notice.";

The air grows more humid and oppressive, the scents of mold and decay war with one another for primacy as you trek deeper into the abyss. Many of the paths you cross show signs of mutant aggression as the innumerable scuff marks dotting the floor all tell the sad tale you've seen far too often on the surface. You muse, observing the trail the heel prints and nail scratches, and claw marks scattered about the floor where some luckless soul was dragged off into the gloom. Gradually, these signs of resistance fade as pieces of what may have once been a bright orange cleansuit litter the ground like luminescent bread crumbs as whoever this once was seemed to have succumbed to their infection, you note, as you spy the unsubtle change in the scrawling blemishes belighting the ground grow closer in shape till at last they become indistinguishable from one another.";

The labs fare little as most appear to have been host to some manner of stampede, or wild mass exodus of their previous occupants as ruined priceless equipment and rare chemicals litter the floor like common trash on the surface. Others though are far less fortunate, as the building plumbing and waste water pipes have ruptured like benighted cysts spilling countless gallons of foul-smelling liquid into them, ruining anything of value they may have contained. More than once, you come across a lab with its HVAC seals still intact and flooded to the rafters as if it were some mockery of a bottle garden.";

Alongside it, you spot the wriggling bright yellow forms of plasmodial colonies glomming onto the walls, and partially translucent Cnidaria tendrils shaped like a prismatic helix spotted with glowing red nodules reminiscent of the boiling plasma found on the rims of accretion disks spirals aimlessly through the murk. Observing the blobs movement, you can almost feel the hate and... envy, radiating off from the distressed primeval eyes of the fetal mass as they longingly stare at your [bodydesc of player] [bodyname of Player] body.";

A part of you doubts if the creatures could even leave their fetid cradle at this point, at least in their current state. Who knows how much of their minds are still intact, or if it would even be possible to change them, you remake internally, watching a light fog form around your palm print. You observe the fetal creature swimming next to it, its crude misshapen limbs flailing akin to some emaciated palsy victim, as it tries to place its crooked hand beside yours, though you use the term in the loosest possible sense. The tainted appendages graying flesh is spotted with chem burns both old, and new, its digits twisted as if they were suffering from Dupuytren's contracture as its rubbery calloused fingers struggle to stay unclenched.";

Its weeping gums are riddle with sickly yellow phosphorescent cysts, and a thin bone spur-riddled tongue nestled along the rotten appendage. Stretching its maw at an impossible wide angle, the thing lunges at the aluminum crystal barrier with unnatural speed, its impact sends a resound quake through the floor beneath as its fangs shatter on the artificial sapphire. Caught off guard by the explosion of violence as the creature batters its unearthly maw against the wall, heedless of the damage it does to itself, you stumble back and slip on an errant puddle of some nameless viscous ooze. You're sent tumbling back, and collide with a door leading to a darkened adjacent lab. The aperture holds for but a moment, then gives with frightful metallic knell as you fall into the all-encompassing gloom with a loud thud.";

Your senses are greeted by the sweet pungent tang of ozone mixed with organic decay like some great inferno had raged through here. As if to confirm these suspicions, you note the presence of a melted lab bench tucked in the corner of the otherwise vacant room and the huddled charred remains of a cleansuit curled in a ball beneath it. The former occupant was likely in the throes of nanite conversion as you note the former human's carbonized form is draped in boiled blackened plastic akin to a shroud, twisted far beyond the acceptable norms of baseline humanity. Their legs are bent at alien insectoid angles that end in long scything claws. Their jaws are split down the middle and lined with saw-like fangs akin to some abyssal fish while tendrils longer than the victim was tall sprout from their back and tailbone.

Looking at the picture, you see a middle-aged, if somewhat overweight, latino man with almond eyes, rosy dimpled cheeks, a kind weather beaten face, and glossy, oiled, slicked back hair dressed in a tuxedo.

You then turn your attention to the binder, leafing through the pages. You realize that its an inter-lab shipping manifest belonging to someone called, worker class code 5192 R.

The slimy thing still slips through his grasp and vanishes under the hood, leaving you both in stunned silence. Unsure what to make of what just transpired, you nervously paw at your brood-swollen middle, wondering what this could mean for you little one. Perhaps sensing your distress, Kluaz nuzzles your hand reassuringly, while he rubs his sleek predatory form against you as if to comfort you, and his perceived daughter.

Mulling your options a tad more, you finally settle on a middle option. By salvaging bits of furniture, lab equipment, and cast off clothing you can Macgyver something like sled or skip, tie a rope to it, and haul it up the stairs.

Although you have no idea who would buy it given the state of the city, logic has never stopped such people before. No reason to assume a little thing like the apocalypse will change that, you muse, drifting down the alleyways till you are about two addresses away from the canning facility. As you're about to round the last corner, you hear an odd burst of static followed by the dulcet tones of a male singer. Despite the occasional skip of the player, his voice is regal, smooth, and clear. Even the gentle clash of the waves and low thrum of sea birds seem to hush themselves in reverence to his cadance. Accompanying him, is a skilled band of well-tuned brass and lively drums playing something that sounds like classic pop. Straining your ears, you can about just make the words.";

She takes them over to a slightly less cluttered section of her livingspace, pulls out a hotplate, mess kit, and a multitool from one of the nearby drawers. You watch as she flips out a can opener, as now salivating Medea cuts open the tin, drops the contents into a mess pan and puts it on the hot plate. Setting it to medium, Medea plucks a vial of white powder from the pile of chemicals you collected, cracks the lid, and sprinks the substance into the pan while jostling the contents as the room begins to fill with a gentle oceanic aroma spliced with mouth-wateringly sweet citrus scents. Curious, you ask what chemical she's making or distilling.";

Perturbed, you inquire if you've just been on a glorified food raid. 'N-n-no...,' Medea answers in a childish tone as she stares intently at the pan to avoid eye contact. 'Well, ok maybe a little, I can assure you though, the rest of these things are completely necessary for my work. Scout's honor,' Medea says, briefly placing her left hand on her heart and raising her right like she was being sworn in at court. Right, you reply dryly in annoyance.

Sure, your reply, saunter up beside her, you take hold of Ava's massive paw and are struck by both the glossy sensation of your entwing pads neatly gliding against each other, but the strength of your larger lover's grips paw as her hand fully encompasses your own.

You coo, nuzzling your [bodydesc of Player] muzzle along the side of her fuzzy arm, delighting in her sweet alpine scent and soft caress of her spotted fur tickling your cheeks. 'Much,' Ava simpers as you guide her through the wreckage. The pair of you gingerly pick your way past the wreckage, till you come to Medea's office and politely knock on the door announcing your presence. 'Come on in friend, you have great timing.

You reply in an even tone, cocking an eyebrow at her. 'I, um, you see, I-I, *gulp*, may have had a few bad experiences with larger infected individuals,' Medea peeps, sounding like she's on the verge of a panic attack as her eyes dart around the ruined sections of the building searching for something though you can't say what. 'Oh, I understand,' Ava frowns, looking at the damaged building with a mote of understanding in her eyes. 'I'm so sorry to have troubled you Miss,' she says apologetically, bowing her head.

So please do come in, you should see the fruits of her, and my own labor,' Dr. Medea replies, her tone brightening a bit as she gestures for the two for you to enter. Following her lead, you both squeeze into Medea's office and take a seat beside one another on the floor while Medea pulls out a pair of vials from her coat. 'Right, so I don't know how much [Name of Player] has told you much about this, but thanks to her I been able to isolate a number of command code from infected with, well let's call them,' she hesitates a moment, tapping her toe claws in a thoughtful rhythm searching for the right word, 'unusual reproductive strategies. From them, I've been able to isolate a series of genes and nanomachine commanded codes that should, in theory, enable two biological women to reproduce without male or herm assistance. Regrettably, I can only bind it to a single pureblooded strain.'";

Furthermore, if you're transformed even partially, I can not guarantee this treatment will survive the process. So if you have any desire to take on a different purebreed form, I would recommend doing so before you take this,' she concludes, placing a clear glass vial with a glowing pink fluid sloshing inside of it each of your paws. Well that shouldn't be a problem. As far both of you know, Ava was born a Margay Taur, so you doubt that she can even be transformed in the conventional sense. Now that you think about it, she's probably the original too, you reply. 'Really, is that true?' Medea asks, fixing Ava with a clinical inquiring stare. 'Ya, I was the only one for a while, until I,' she wavers, a note of deep-seeded shame lacing itself through her otherwise bright tenor, 'infected her. But it wasn't on purpose, I'm not a monster! I'm not like those things out there, I swear!'";

'Oh I didn't know that, it must have been quite a shock for both of you, but for what it's worth, I believe you,' Medea says reassuringly as she paws up to the massive tauress and gives her shoulder a gentle squeeze. 'But I'm going to assume [Name of Player] that since you've decided to keep this form you're happy to stay in it.' she adds, turning to face you. Grinning, you tell her that your new body has grown on you in recent days. If you have to maintain it to have children with Ava, that really doesn't seem like a problem to you anymore. Besides, if you ever have your form compromised Ava can always just reinfect you no problem. 'Hm,' Medea says, tapping her muzzle.";
	say "     'If that's the case, it would ensure you can never truly lose your enhancements. There is a good chance that it could even be passed to offspring. In time, it might even become stable, perhaps even ingrained enough in your strain that it can affect other infected, and even baseline humans. I know there are quite a few lesbain couple who would kill for the opportunity,' she adds with a lewd, toothy, reptilian grin. 'Um, I have one question Miss. This isn't going to make me grow a nasty cock or something?' Ava asks, holding the vial before between her thumb and point claw as she hesitantly peers at the contents. 'What, no of course not, I pruned every gene loci, and scrubbed every line of code relating to phalli. Don't misunderstand me though, your bodies will change, I had to make some creative workarounds,' she chirps in a proud trill, as she motions to her ad-hock lab with a flick of her tail. 'You wouldn't believe how hard it was to stabilize. I ended up having to pull some junk code from some other sample left my former patients to fill gaps and prevent rejection.'";

'Right but what's a fall-eye and gander inversion?' Ava asks, cocking her head to the side. Dick, Ava, she means dick, as in she's not going to grow one and suddenly turn into a hyper herm or some yucky dude, you tease. 'Well that's good, I think I'm ready to do this now. Are you?' Ava says, swirling the vial's contents in her paw. Nodding, you tell her you're more than ready, so, cheers, you titter, clicking your vials together, and downing the exotic slurry in unison. Mhm tastes kind of like a thick chalky strawberry milkshake. What do you think Ava? You quip smacking lips as you feel the strange chemicals tickle your stomach lining. 'I like how fatty it tastes, kind of like mommy's milk mixed with pepto. I don't feel any different though when does it start to-, oh. This feels nice,' Ava chuffs, 'like someone's pushing on my tummy from the inside.' Ava purrs running a paw over her anthro stomach.";
	say "     Placing a paw over your own rumbling middle, you find yourself agreeing with her. Although you recognize the sensation as something more akin to indigestion. The feeling spreads down to your lower half only to concentrate itself in your tail and anthro back. Then just as quickly as it came, the pressure breaks like a fever, leaving you with a needy empty feeling in the pit of your belly, not all that dissimilar to one of your feline heats. Your body however remains unaltered, except for a slight draft along the tip of your tail and trapezius of your anthro back, whipping the limb around, you spot the first change almost immediately. Parting your tail fur, you're pleasantly surprised to find your body has grown what appears to a faux-ovipositor slit. Curious, you stroke the length of it feeling a raw meaty tube hiding inside of it connected to something down near the base of your feral hind end. Your analytical side surmises it likely leads to either your current ovaries, or perhaps another specially adapted set.";

	say "     Letting go of your modified limb, you shift your focus to your back, patting the area around your shoulder blades. Your padded fingers soon find the other alteration as they brush against a smooth set of six tendrils. The fresh appendages, that are a little longer than your tail and not all that dissimilar to a Tentacle Horror's limbs, are clustered on either side of your spine. On first touch, your body doesn't recognize them as being a part of you, they feel cold and deadened to you like they were injected with way too much novacaine. Sensation slowly trickles into them though as your body's nanites adapt them to your current nervous system. In moments, you can exert a modicum of control over the new limbs even though doing so is about as easy as typing when your arm's fallen asleep. This too seems to fade and with enough time, you're sure that you'll be able to manipulate them just as easily as you would any other appendage. Turning your attention back to Ava, you see she's playing with her own ovipositor.";

But, I've never seen one of these back here before, how is this even going to work.' Chuckling, you saunter up behind her, you wrap your tail around hers, instructing her to turn around and you'll show her. Assuming the doctor doesn't mind the show, you ask, casting a glance at Medea, who pulls up a stool, mobile privacy curtain, and a clipboard. She swiftly seats herself, giving you the thumbs up sign as she wheels the cloth divider between you and her. 'Oh, I love it when you take charge,' Ava trills, squaring her legs and presenting her plush hind end to you. Not for the first time, your tauric body shivers with delight at the sight of your larger mate's cute cavernous cunt and lush feral dugs on full display. Her posture and needy heat-laden scent excites your senses as you leap on her back, mounting her the way your exotic body prefers. A low purr escapes your lips as you drape your voluptuous body over hers.";
	WaitLineBreak;

You cheekily snake your tendrils about her anthro breasts in a living bow while you guide her tail-mounted ovipositor with your own to your sweltering feline flower, mewing encouragement for her to do what her body tells her to as you massage her egg laying limb along the lush lips of your feral vulva. Mewling in agreement, Ava's newly forged limb surges through your grip, spearing your lush, drooling, heat-engorged muff. 'So warm, I never knew I could feel this good,' Ava coos as her virgin egg-slit brushes your inner sex, stretching the sensitive tissue in the most sinfully sweet ways. Chuffing happily, you lean your anthro torso against hers, nibbling on her kitty neck fur. You whisper tender nothings in her ear as you kiss the nape of her neck while you playfully grope her lush milky bosoms. You sink your padded hand paws and collection of dexterous tendrils into her bloated milk tanks, delighting at the silky caress of her fur along the smooth surface of your fingers as your elated digits sink into her taut creamy mounds, creating the little impression in her engorged tit flesh.";
	say "     Massaging the hefty orbs, you can practically feel the milk wallow within them as you tweak Ava nips as you goad her. So ripe and heavy, she's going to make the perfect mother with these, you bet your kittens will never go hungry. Still, you tease, fluffing her furry bosoms, you can't wait to see how big they get once you get a few litters under her belt and she has a nice big tummy to cushion them on. You snake your exotic appendages along the edges of Ava's heat swollen lips like you were hotdogging her lust-flushed cunt. Her tender petals clench and crinkle around your sensuous limb as you exalt in the innervation of her warm dewy lips caressing your raw ovi tail-cunt. You're almost surprised at the level of sensation your modified limb is able to experience with each stroke of Ava's plump breeder's box. Where once you would have likened your prior tail play to a rough fingering, the fresh nerves of your ovi slit and the alien tissue lining tail is almost on par with your cunny. Your body's burgeoning instincts demand more though, and you're quite happy to oblige them.";

You practically swoon with elation, as your walls massage her ovi tube with deviant alacrity, the heat-fueled muscle clenching around her tail with a desperate inhuman vigor. With every bestial thrust of her soft girthy limb, the subtle changes to her become more apparent as your slick channel brushes the soft ribbed cartillage and muscles lining her modded limb in concentric ring.You rumble with raw passionate delight at the sensation of those exotic bumps and pleasant valleys gracing your satin box as you dig your foreclaws into her fur.";
	say "     That's a good kitty, keep going just that, and you'll earn yourself a big belly full of kittens, you croon as you lightly kiss the points of her ears and your padded palms drift to her stomach. Running your paws through the soft pliable fur, you ask in a teasing tone as your claws braise the lush equator of her tail stuffed tummy, if she's looking forward to being your personal breeder. 'Yes,' she mews, as her paws join yours, 'yes, fill me! I want to be as big as mommy, no, bigger! I don't want to feel empty ever again,' Ava cries in a heat-fueled caterwaul as she wraps her tendrils around you, hugging you close and groping your lush curves. Of course, you tell your eager little kitten factory, you promise you'll keep her full from now on. You'll never see your paws or the floor again. From now on whenever you look down all you'll see is a nice tummy packed to the brim with cute baby taurs and a fat set of bloated milkers. By the time you're rescued you'll have hordes of obedient margay taurs waiting on our every need. She won't have to move a claw, or be lonely ever again.";

I can't wait to see the look on her face when we come waddling home with a basket full of kittens for her to play with,' Ava coos mischievously at the thought. Her body twitches with excitement as she caresses her feral undercarriage fondling the outline of your egg-laying limb with a clawed forepaw as her sweltering passage seems to clench your exotic limb. That's right sweetie, you doubt anyone will be able to keep her paws off her when they see that nice belly swaying between her legs. You trill delightedly as an unusual stiffness and pressure slowly builds along the base of your tailbone.";
	say "     Far from unpleasant, the lurid sensation seems to grow with each meaty thrust of your ovipositor. Your exotic muscle tenses as your egg-laying limb seems to ripple like a wind sock in a gale. As the new specialized muscles push along the first of many gel-like eggs, no larger than a cantaloupe, you can feel the soft-shelled embryos bloating your mutant canal almost to the edge of some forbidden elysium as they rapidly pass their way through your sordid appendage. A part of you feels like you should be bracing for a rush of pain or discomfort as the tender tissue spasms wildly with each false contraction. It never comes though, as your aberrant nerves and exotic muscles sing in rapture instead with each little ripple as the egg parts Ava's plush lips. You can feel her seemingly [one of]bottomless[or]canyon-like[or]cavernous[or]expansive[or]elephantine[or]titanic[or]person-swallowing[at random] passage stretch with your eggy bounty, your needy tauress gasps for breath crying, 'Oh yes [Name of Player] don't stop!' as she paws at her feral stomach, caressing the impression of eggs as one after another of your soft-shelled ovum stretches her hypertrophic passage in ways few could ever hope to.";

'Oh mommy, its so [italic type]*RAWR*![roman type],' Ava roars in primal satisfaction as her ovipositor undulates within you as her egg-laying muscles spasm to deliver their precious cargo alongside a gush of feminine honey. You can feel her tail swell with their size as they press against your feral half. You find yourself panting in anticipation. Your heat-tainted body wants nothing more than to feel those gooey eggs inside you as the first ovum forces your tight cunny to part like the Red Sea. Fuck yes! You purr sensing the exotic bulging ribbing of Ava's ovipositor and her gelatinous eggs innervating your [Cunt Size desc of Player] snatch with their passage in a steady stream, like boba passing through you like a crazy straw. You swiftly lose count of how many eggs pass your sodden sex.";
	say "     Your senses become overloaded with maternal bliss as your womb swells with their presence, forcing your [breast size desc of player] tummy tits to fight for space around them. Your body groans and heaves before you with untold bounty as their passage hits you like a chain of erotic firecrackers being set off in your core. As the last egg nestles itself into your waiting womb, you find yourself sporting a pair of taut stomachs that would put an octomom to shame. Unable to resist touching them, your tendrils and paws fondle the sensitive fatty orbs as you trace the outline of each egg. Casting a glance at Ava, you can see she's equally enthralled with her litter as she dreamily massages her sagging tummy with her paw-like hands as if to confirm its presence, saying, 'Wow this is all mine, I can't believe it. I've never felt so huge before, it's amazing. Everything feels so raw and tender, I don't ever want this to end.'";

She hasn't experienced half the fun yet, as your back tentacles grope her expansive pot belly and pendulous breasts. 'Ours mh,' she simpers, smacking her lips as if to taste the word, 'I think like the sound of that,' Ava trills, gently leaning her anthro half against yours. You drape your arms around her larger frame, hugging her doughy form close, telling her that you hope so. You might be planing on having a lot more litters after this one after all. 'Good, because I want to fill the world with our kittens,' Ava purrs dreamily. 'You know if I could. I'd arrange for every girl I have to have your charms. So every minute, of every hour, every girl could have a chance to find what I've found in your arms,' Ava swoons. Nuzzling your muzzle against her cheek, you tell her that's sound like a lofty goal, but one that you could be very eager to assist with. 'Heh thanks,' Ava mews, kissing your feline muzzle."; [Ava is quoting Dean Martin's song, 'Everybody Loves Somebody' here.]
	say "     'Now let's head back to the Last Chance. I don't want Drake to worry.' Nodding in agreement, you tell her that sounds like a good idea. Besides, you can't wait to see the look on their faces when they see your augmented bodies. Not to mention, you have some things in the city you like to keep an eye on. Much as you'd enjoy cuddling with Ava for a little while longer, time is rarely on your side. 'I know, hehe, mommy is gonna be so jelly when she sees us,' Ava replies as you dismount her. Turning her attention to the good doc, Ava continues saying, 'Oh and Doctor Medea, I can't thank you enough for your hard work. You've made me the happiest girl in the world.' Parting the blinds, Medea swifty drapes her clipboard over her dripping groin and tells Ava it was her pleasure. She also invites both of you to come back for a follow up visit anytime if there are any complications. Nodding, the two of you tell her that you'll keep that in mind and gingerly make your way back out of the office after you collect your things.";

As you walk, Ava gushes over the experience and peppers you with questions on what to expect in the coming days. All of which you are happy to answer. Besides, it's a good way to kill time on the trip, waddling your way back to the Dry Plains. Three hours later, the two of you are almost in sight of the Last Chance and Ava stops in her tracks saying. 'Hey, I was thinking you might want to wait out here for a while. You see, I kind of didn't tell them what I was planning and well... It might be better if I had a few minutes to explain this to daddy on my own.' [italic type]What?![roman type] She didn't tell them about what's going on? You query. 'Mh-hm, I wanted to make it a surprise,' Ava says, shrugging as she squints and makes a cute blep face at you. A surprise, oh dang it did she even make any plans on how you were going to feed or house our kids. Just imagine if they come out her size!";
	say "     Does she have any idea how hard it would be to keep them at The Last Chance? You stammer at her audacity. 'Oh, I was going to send them off to live with you. I've heard you're staying in some kind of huge bunker complex with a big library building nearby, so you should have plenty of space. Besides, your kids seem to be able to forage just fine. I'm sure a few more mouths to feed won't be a problem,' Ava replies as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Rumbling in annoyance, you tell her she's not wrong. You've gotten quite adept at whelping ardent survivors, and yes the Abbey does have a good deal of space. You'd prefer it though if she ran things past you a bit more from now. 'Of course, I promise I won't do anything like this again without consulting you first.' Ava says. Shrugging, you tell her you're going to hold her to that. 'Thanks I knew you'd understand, now let me go talk with daddy.' Please do, you can already feel the crosshairs on the back of your head, you reply gesturing to the pillbox atop The Last Chance as Ava heads off."; [This is a Gears of War reference.]

	say "     Making your way along the road to the Last Chance, you overhear a minor din of activity from behind the curtain wall. Listening closely, you can just barely make out the sounds of pained grunts and claws scraping along the blacktop. Fear like you've never known grips your heart as you rush to the gate, heedless of danger as your maternal instincts scream at you to find and protect Ava and your kittens, no matter the cost. Bounding to the gate as fast as your legs can carry you. You kick the thing open and unsheath your talons, ready to fell anything that threatens your family. However, the sight that greets you is not what you'd expected. Gathered in a circle in the courtyard, you spot eight Margay Taurs who you instantly recognize on some intrinsic level as yours. Each one is as large as Ava and covered in strips of blue powder from head to toe save for their paws, which are dyed red. They appear to be circling around a shirtless Drake like a pack of hunting cats.";
	say "     In his hands, he wields a pair of crudely carved foam tonfa covered in the same blue colored dye coating your children's fur. The sight makes your choler rise and bubble as you're about to scream at him and demand to know what he's doing to your precious babies. But a slightly slimmer Ava yells for attention as she runs over to your side from inside the garage. 'Hey [Name of Player] you're just in time to see the end of today's lessons.'  Lessons? You query, eyeing up the improvised thunder dome you've walked into. 'Ya daddy's teaching them how to fight as a group. He says wants to make sure they're able to hold their own out in the city if you guys ever get separated. They're doing pretty good actually, one of them almost landed a hit before you got here,' Ava replies proudly. 'Ya,' Drake huffs, sounding a little fatigued but nonetheless pleased. 'Your girls are pretty quick on the uptake. Don't know if it's the nanites, or their parents['] good genes, but your kitten here are fast learners.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Ah, thanks grandpa Drake,' one of your daughters remarks as she swipes at Drake's legs with her left hand as if she were about to claw his torso. Despite her nanite-enhanced speed, Drake backpedals around the blow. A word or two of advice bubbles then dies in your chest, as you realize that her attack was a feint as she swings her forepaw at him. Once again, she's too slow though as he ducks under her limb and slashes at her leg, leaving a fresh blue smear on her pelt. 'That's your leg gone sweetie,' Drake grunts rolling away from her as your daughter tucks her paw into her side. 'You ladies need practice working together! Don't come at me one at a time anymore. You're more than your sisters, you're a pack, er,' he hesitates, his catty amber eyes rolling towards the clouds then back to your kitten, 'pride, you should be more in tune with each other. So let's go, AGAIN!' Drake bellows sounding like a football coach, bashing his tonfa against each other releasing a cloud of blue powder while he takes a formless guarded stance.";
	say "     'YES SIR!' Your girls roar in unison as they circle about him like a proper pride. With no small amount of joy, you watch your daughters launch feints and probing at their prey, forcing Drake to split his attention between them. His movements are quick and fluid as parries and dodges your little ones strikes with practiced ease. Yet, you can see the limits in his defenses conferred by his lesser bipedal body. He only has two arms, two legs, two eyes, and a reach of a few feet. Your daughters meanwhile are not so inhibited, as they press their tauric advantage, attacking in groups of three. They claw, kick, and bat at him with their natural armaments from every direction. Drake struggles to keep up. His body twists and weaves around the savage attacks like he was made of water and wind, not flesh and bone. Tough as he may be, his body and the nanites can only be pushed so far.";
	WaitLineBreak; 
	say "      Sweat glistens from his brow and pours down the toned hills of his sternum like a river of shimmering diamonds, his pecs heave with each ragged breath as he ducks one of your daughters paws and tries unsuccessfully to aim a riposte at their under belly. Your girls however have hardly broken a sweat as they dance between each other, careful not to impede their litter-mates['] avenues of attack and egress. Large as they are, you imagine it would be easy for them to trip over one another. Still, they keep a rough cohesion without speaking despite their inexperience. You can almost taste the air of inevitability as their train of blows rain down on the little human's guard forcing him to his knees. '*Huff* *huff* don't get cocky girls, I'm not out of this yet!' Drake pants as he lunges between your daughter and slash at their undercarriage while he passes under them. 'Your down hun,' Drake rumbles rolling out from underneath as your daughter feigns a collapse. 'Come on girls, I believe in you! You're not gonna let some old man show you up in front of your moms!' Drake jeers climbing to his feet, with his back to your daughter's prone form.";
	say "     'Heck no!' one of them cries, charging in like a bull seeing red as she tries to swat him with an over-handed swipe. 'Ha, good effort sweetie, but you shouldn't break rank,' Drake sneers, leaping back and slashing at her paw. He lands on your defeated daughter's side, motioning for the rest of them to come at him. Your daughter stares at the blue streak on her paw for a moment before charging again, but this time she's not alone. Two others join, trying to pincer Drake between them. No way is he getting out of this, you muse, watching five sets of red paws come down at him from different angles. At the last moment though, Drake jumps and bounds between their outstretched arms as he slashes at their faces. 'Fudge,' you hear one of them grumble as they playfully collapse on another in a pile. 'No fair grandpa, you're so small, how can we hit you!?' one of the girls moans exasperatedly from underneath her litter-mates.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'That's what girls got to figure out. Your opponents are not going to tell you how to defeat them,' Drake quips as he lands atop them. Looking at them though, a part of you wonders if Drake is going too far, but squeeze on your arm from Ava stops you as she says, 'I know it looks like he's being mean, but don't try to stop them. I begged daddy to teach them and not to hold back. You've been out in the city, you know what the mutants would do to them if they got a chance.' Blinking back a tear, you nod telling her, you know all too well. Then turn your attention back to still standing kids and yell encouragement to them. Your little one's ears perk up at the sound of your voice as the remaining four circle back around him. Pacing around Drake, an odd look passes between them as each seems to eye one of his limbs. 'Ah, got a plan this time girls, or are you waiting for me to keel over from old age? Give it another sixty, seventy odd years and that just might work,' Drake laughs, his lips curling into a proud yet oddly toothy grin, revealing a pair of saber-shaped canines.";
	say "     Don't answer him girls, you got this! Remember your moms are rooting for you! you cry. 'Ya get them girls! We believe in you!' Ava cheers, clutching your arm tightly in her paws. 'Ha, hear that ladies, you're not gonna let your moms down now are you?' Drake taunts through a happy rumble. 'No way!' They bellow in unison as they regroup. 'Good! Now,' the big man pauses as he takes a deep audible breath. Watching him exhale, you notice a pair thick white wisps of steams coiling around his fangs as all tension and fatigue seems to leave his body and a look of peace and anticipation blossoms on his lip. 'SHOW ME WHAT YOU CAN DO!!' He roars as your daughter charges in. Drake whirls tonfa about him warding off blow after blow yet with his focus locked on their flurry of paws and claws. He doesn't notice their tendrils lashing out and grabbing hold of his arm. Panic and just a hint of respect runs across Drake's face as tries to slash at it but his balance is thrown off as other daughters['] tentacles latch and toss him to the ground.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     In flash, they leap upon and sweep their dye-covered paws across his chest. 'That's you down grandpa,' one of them taunts, adding a little flourish of red to his sternum. 'Ha-Ha-ha, I guess so,' Drake chuffs as they let go of him. While he pushes himself to his feet, you get a good view at where your girl [']hit['] him and have to suppress a laugh as you realize that they've drawn a red smiley face on Drake's abs. Looking down at the mark, the man lets loose a light chuckle as he congratulates your remaining daughters. 'Good job girls, I think you guys have got the hang of things, just don't skimp on practice. You should remember that you won't always have the advantage of numbers, size, limbs, or the luxury of attrition. Although considering who your other mother is, [italic type]*TZK*[roman type]' He clicks his fangs and shrugs. 'I could be wrong about the numbers part. Still, you did good, with a little practice. I'm sure you girls will be able to handle most of what the city can throw at you.'";
	say "     'But please, watch each other's backs, and,' he smirks, cocking his head in your direction, 'take care of your mom out there. She's a good woman, you're lucky to have her.' Drake says, giving you an approving nod. 'Anyways, I'm gonna get washed up, and give you girls some space. Oh Ava, don't forget I have some water warming on the roof of the garage if you want to give them a proper bath. I don't think you want to lick the dye off. It's not edible,' he adds, motioning to his core. 'Sure thing dad,' Ava replies as Drake makes his way up to Kathy's room. Once he closes the door behind him, Ava lets out a deep sigh saying. 'Oh mommy, that was a little hard to watch.' Patting her on the arm, you tell her you're inclined to agree, but understand why she put the kittens through that. Better they learn how to fight here, than out in the city where the consequences are a bit more dire. 'Thanks, I'm glad you understand,' Ava says, giving you a big fluffy hug.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Oh moms, don't be so dramatic, that was kind of fun,' one of your dye-smeared daughters says as she tries dusting off her pelt. 'Ya, it sort of felt like we were dancing after a while, though I wouldn't mind a bath. My skin is getting really itchy,' your daughter who got her belly slashed says gesturing to her underside. 'Also, we kind of need names. Mommy Ava said she didn't want to give us one till you got back,' your daughter who got her paws bopped adds. 'I, um, second this, it feels weird not knowing what to call myself,' yet another of your daughters chimes in. You don't see why not, but how about you give them a bath first. It looks like they got into a fight with an angry paint mixer, you joke, gesturing to the blue dye marring their pelts. When they're all clean, we can think about names. How does that sound?";
	say "     'Great!' your girls answer in unison as they line up in an orderly fashion for you. Leaning over to Ava, you compliment her on teaching them to queue so soon, most adults never figure that one out. 'I didn't, they sort of just knew, they must have 'learned' it from your side,' Ava says, throwing up her paws. Shrugging, you tell her that you guess so and ask if she can grab the water Drake mentioned. 'Sure thing!' Ava replies jumping up on her hindleg and plucking an arm full of gallon-sized milk jugs off the roof and sets them in a pile at your paws. Passing one back to her, you tell Ava to hold it over your daughter's head and slowly pour it out while you scrub them down. Ava nods and the pair of you spend the next few minutes cleaning and bonding with your kittens. Like your prior progeny, they seem to have inherited much of their mother's emotional intelligence, and already seem to have the minds, if not the bodies of adults.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Although they seem to have few gaps in their knowledge base compared to your earlier broods as they admit they barely know how to read, write, or do basic math. From experience, you guess it might have something to do with the fact you weren't the one who breastfed them. When you bring it up with them, Ava and the kitten's express their agreement. To the letter, you girls are a little bit curious about what they missed out on and ask if they could try suckling to see if that might balance them out. Flashing them a reassuring smile, you invite them to your breast one at a time, enjoying the brief profound moment of connection with your kittens.";

Her ears perk at the sound of the gate clicking closed and turning her head to face you. As your eyes meet, Ava waves you over with an excited look on her muzzle. Padding over to her side, you coyly ask her why she looks so happy to see you today. 'Cause I have a surprise for you. Can you guess what it is?' Ava replies, her tail happily swishing behind her. Well judging from her lack of tum, you surmise she's given birth, though you don't see your kids anywhere. 'Daw you ruined the surprise, though I guess I should have worn a baggy shirt or something,' Ava pouts, playfully stomping her back foot. Tittering, you remark that you doubt she could find one her size. 'Ya... oh well surprise ruined. Ahem,' Ava clears her throat, '[italic type]KIDS, COME ON OUT[roman type]. Your other mother is here. It's time for you to meet her.' Ava shouts in the direction of The Chance.";

Returning the gesture, you ask them about their names and how they've been. 'Um, they don't have names yet [Name of Player]. I thought about it, and after all the work you did it's only fair that you get to name them.' Blinking in surprise, you tell her you don't mind, but you might need a few minutes to get a better sense of who they are first. 'Sure, come on girls take a seat by us, I want you all to meet your other mom,' Ava simpers, gesturing for your children to join her in the garden. Nodding, your daughters bound over her and the lot cuddle up to one another, for much much needed introductions.";

Here, your daughters admit that they are not really all that literate or know much in the way of math. This strikes you as odd, your previous broods generally seemed to know everything you do. Then it hits you, your past litters were all breast fed and carried by you, so these girls likely only know what Ava knows. Perhaps, you offer if they suckled from you. You could share your wisdom with them. It would far easier not to mention faster than trying to teach on the fly.";

In a way, it does feel odd knowing that you are these children's [']mother['] despite not being the one who carried them.

	say "     Drawn inexorably back to the Last Chance by your ever-growing maternal instincts, you're pleasantly surprised to see your latest batch of kittens and their mother waiting in a loose circle together in Drake's Garden. Even their [']Grandfather['] seems to be sitting cross-legged in the middle of their gathering, with their backs resting on the bronze marker at the center of the garden. In his lap is a large-by-human-standards light blue plastic ring binder, stuffed to the gills with plastic sheet protectors, that he seems to be showing to your cubs as he gestures to the pages. Although from your current angle, you can't see the pages contents clearly, you still spy something that looks like old photos or cards arrayed in even rows tucked into the pages. Curiosity piqued, you begin to shut the entrance to the Chance behind you before heading over to see what's going on. At the sound of the gate being shuffled back into position, Drake looks up at you and as your eye's meet, the man passes the binder to Ava and beckons you over with a wide proud toothy grin and eager wave of his hand before leaping to his feet.";
	say "     As he strides towards you, it's almost impossible not to notice his fangs have grown somewhat longer since you last saw him, as their pearlescent serrated edges poke out from his lips. Strangely though, despite prior reticence towards his partial transformation, he seems oddly at peace with this and makes no effort to conceal them behind his once dour expression. Perhaps your kitten's presence is softening him to his changes, or he's showing them as a way to bond with your little ones. Regardless, you take a measure of comfort that the cubs and him are getting along, especially after Ava, [']surprised him['] with your first litter. Open-minded as you may be, a part of you wouldn't have held it against him if he took a measure of umbrage at the sudden imposition. Still, as he paws up to you with a relaxed stride, you can't say that you're not a touch curious about his presence. As you gallop over to the redwood walkway crisscrossing the garden to meet him, you tactfully ask Drake what he's doing. 'Ah, the kittens were curious about-,' he hesitates a moment, as a brief look of reluctance grows on his chiseled visage, then vanishes behind a proud leonine smirk.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'My side of the family,' he replies with a casual bob of his head in the direction of your little ones. 'So, thought I'd break out the family photo-album, a lot of history in that and in the name, not all of it good though. Speaking of which, I got something for ya,' he rumbles as he motions for you to wait a moment as he fishes around in his pants pocket. You feel your nose twitch as the breeze catches and with come the scents of stale oil, organic decay, and the lingering tang of carbonized matter impregnating the dust around the Last Chance sweeps through the area. Then, just as quickly it came, the gust shifts again, and the smell is gone, replaced by the sweet perfume of the garden alongside the calming aroma of your assembled family. 'Here,' he says, in commanding a patriarchal tone as he passes you a tiny polaroid, 'I took a few of these right after the girls were born, figured you might like one since you couldn't attend,' Drake grumbles in low annoyed tone as you take the picture from his hand.";
	say "     You reply in a level tone, that you would have come if you could, but it's hard to plan these things with the state of the city, and the speed at which some people can come to term now. '*Hrump* I guess you're right, you're doing your best with your situation, which is more than can be said for a lot of would-be-parents nowadays,' he retorts with a heavy shrug of his well-muscled shoulders. He gestures to the stricken city with a jab of his left thumb, eliciting a low groan from the too-tight fabric of his shirt as it struggles to contain the big man's nanite-enhanced physique. 'Still, you should hang on to it, it was hard enough to find self-developing film for my old camera before the apocalypse, and uh word to the wise [Name of Player], don't let any of the latex fu-,' he growls, in a harsh steely tenor reminiscent of your first encounter when he held you at gunpoint as the rumble in his chest grows loud and more bestial and he bares his fangs in a predatory grimace.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     His slitted eyes narrow to fine umbral pinpricks, cast in unflinching citrine, if only for a moment. However, as the bright happy giggle of Ava and your kittens worms its way through these sour notes as they flip through the binder, his grim expression evaporates like morning fog. Drake seems to relax, his countenance shifting to a more casual, relaxed state. 'Creatures, even the sane ones, see it. Crazy as this may sound, a lot of them like to eat these sorts of things,' he finishes his sentence. Really, you ask, fixing him with an incredulous look. 'Ya,' the big man clicks his fangs in annoyance, though you can tell it's not directed at you but rather at some unpalatable memory. 'They act like it's some kind of delicacy, don't know why. Suppose it has something to do with the type of plastic, the chemical used in making it, or the way it looks. Not sure really, I haven't had much opportunity to talk to them either. Most of the ones I've run haven't been the... [italic type]talkative type[roman type],' he adds, huffing the phrase with a baneful yet sanitized edge as he glances back at your kittens out of the corner of his leonine eye. Right, you tell him you'll keep that in mind as you level the picture with your catty snoot and look the thing over.";
	say "     You're immediately greeted with the acrid stench of gunpowder imparted by Drake's touch and a vague chemical fume you struggle to place a name to. Your heart, nevertheless, is warmed by the sight of a tired, yet all-too-happy looking Ava reclining on her mattress. Though her fur appears rather damp with impossible perspiration, and her natural eyeliner seems to have darkened just a hair, her expression is one of pure bliss, as nestled in her massive arms are eight of the tiniest, cutest fluffiest kitty taurs you've ever seen, each one is no larger than your hands once were when you were but a puny biped. Their adorable stubby legs can barely even wrap around their mother's arm as she holds them for the camera. Gazing at their eyes, you note that they're an interesting mix of smoke blues and earthy browns, likely a sign the little dears are still somewhat blind and deaf like many new born felines tend to be. While their sweet button noses are a flush shade of pink much in the order of their pads."; [Author's note: According to some gun nuts I know, discharging firearms for prolonged periods can cause the smell of gunpowder to cling to your hands. Cue the more you know GIF.]
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Peering closer, you notice something odd about the kittens['] fur, namely the pronounced absence of the creamy white splotch they seem to have now. Offhandedly, you surmise that this is likely some remnant of their animalistic origins as it is not uncommon for some species to have their hair change color as they age. Considering your own urge to immediately nurse and age up your own brood the instant they're born, combined with the heady brew of maternal hormones swimming through your mind during such occasions, you realize that you never truly thought, or more likely possessed, the clarity of mind to inspect them properly. Even now, you sense a growing urge to feed these lovely kittens nibbling at the back of your mind, you muse as beads of sympathetic cream begin to leak from your chest. Before you can address this, the sound of Drake's voice calls you back to reality. 'Beautiful aren't they?' he asks, rather warmly. Yes, you reply, doing your best to bite back the tears of joy welling within you as thank him for this precious gift.";
	say "     'Don't worry about it [Name of Player], you did right by me and mine, it's the least I can do,' the big man answers with a graceful wave of his hand as if to brush the matter aside. 'Anyways, I'll leave to your, er, thing with the girls,' He adds as walks past you and gives you a respectful pat on the shoulder before heading off to see Kathy and his own kittens-to-be. 'Oh Ava!' Drake hollers from the foot of the staircase. 'Yes daddy?' she answers, as her ears perk up at the sound of his voice. 'When you're done with that,' the big man says, motioning to the binder with a casual flick of his wrist, 'remember to put it somewhere dark, a lot of those photos are pretty light sensitive.' 'Sure thing dad!' she replies, flashing him a respectful smile, as she flips through some of the older looking sections. 'Good girl,' Drake chuffs, as he strides up the stairs and slips into Kathy's room. As he shuts the door behind himself, you notice him sliding something that looks like a dingy white sock with a large hole in the heel over the handle.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Chuckling, you roll your eyes at this, and amble on over to your family, arms held wide as you invite them over. Rumbling happily, your kittens bound toward you in a great fluffy stampede as they crowd around you. Your daughters take turns hugging you in their many-limbed embrace as they pepper you with questions about your own family. Doing your best to calm them down, as their voices and inquiries bleed into one another like a musical squall of mutual fascination, you tell them that you will share your own past, in due time. Though admittedly, you don't have anything as storied as Drake's album on hand, you add, mentally noting how some of the section dividers have little annotated names and dates on them stretching all the way back to the eighteenth century. Not all the names are in proper American English either, a few are written with Yiddish, German, Polish, and even Creole characters. Perhaps though, you can offer them a bit of practical knowledge instead, you reply, motioning to the little beads of creams forming on your chest.";
	say "     After all, the world's a rather dangerous place right now, it's more important to arm your kittens with the skills they'll need to survive and thrive out there first. 'Aw but I want to hear about your side of the family now!' one of your kittens sitting on the edge of the garden pouts, roughly thumping her tail along the ground in an aggravated tattoo. 'Now-now little one,' Ava retorts, as she slips her tendrils about your grumpy child's forepaw and gives it a loving squeeze. 'You should listen to her, she knows better than anyone else how dangerous the city is and she's only looking out for your best interests. Besides, she'll have plenty of time to tell you lots of exciting stories while you're traveling together,' she says, glancing in your direction with a motherly grin on her face, 'isn't that right my sweet mate?' Responding in the affirmative, you tell them of course, and who knows, they just might get a crash course in their family history if they nurse enough.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Really? Me first then. I want to know everything about mommy!' your previously incredulous kitten declares, her tone brightening too excitedly as she eyes your nips with pronounced interest. 'See? I told you girls, your mother is such a wonderful person, now come here, she needs to name you all too,' your matronly mate quips as she motions for you to join them. Rumbling happily at the invitation, you pad over them and seat yourself in the center of the garden where Drake once sat. You note how the wood still carries motes of his warm and slightest hints of his catty musk mixed with light wisps of gunpowder, though you pay their presence little mind. Instead, you roll on your side, exposing your rows of animalistic dugs to your cubs as you summon your eager daughters to your breast. Mewling affectionately, they nod and cuddle up beside you, gleefully tucking their adorable lips to your nips and proceed to suckle. A feeling of unbridled warmth floods your being as your maternal mind basks at the connection this simple act brings along with sudden flush of potential names for your eight children.";

Eager to check in on them, you quietly paw up to them, as you get nearer though, you notice another set of comparatively tiny foot-paws poking out between the entwined forms of your slumbering brood. Tilting your head in curiosity, it takes you a moment to place a name to the tawny gold pelt and supple black toes intermingling with burnished golds, nacre whites, and lustrous jet fur, then it hits you.

'Ya it will be so fun to let them ride us all around the plains, and show them all the cool stuff you've shown us,' one of your daughters seated on the periphery comments in a dreamy tone. 'I want to play with them too! Just imagine all the fun we'll have with our little sisters and baby bros,' one of you daughters seated next to Kathy adds, as she crawls forward and nuzzles her chin along [if Thirst of Kathy is 3]your co-conspirator's[else]their minder's[end if] resplendent middle. 'And you will dear,' Kathy purrs expectantly at the touch of daughter's whiskers tickling her sides. 'Well, one day. For now, I think they need a little more time in the oven. Besides,' she rumbles, cupping her paws about her uppermost row of delectable D-cups, idly admiring their heft as beads of fresh cream leaky between her fuzzy fingers, 'the little ones really know how to bring out my flavor,' Kathy teases, as she hooks a drop of pearly perfection on the tip of her pointer claw and draw the succulent rivet to her lip.";

'Ya, Momma Kathy's milk is the best,' your brood cries in unison over the hungry rumbles of their stomachs as they pull themselves closer with their forepaws. You feel your temper rise at both the perceived insult to your bountiful cream, and the odd slavish reaction of your kittens. However, before you can even think to give voice to these thoughts, Kathy raises her left paw-hand. 'Now-now little ones, don't say that. You're going hurt your [italic type]other[roman type] mother's feeling talking that, and you all wouldn't want that now would you?' the matronly lioness implores with an enchanting trill, gesturing to you with a magnanimous wave of her paw. 'No momma Kathy, we're sorry,' they whine, ears drooping below their forehead and halt in place. 'Ah,' Kathy huffs, puffing out her chest as she motions for them to listen, 'That's better, but you should be apologizing to [Name of Player], not, me don't you think? Why, you haven't even tried your mommy [Name of Player]'s milk yet, now have you?'";
	say "     'No,' several of them mumble, as your brood turns their attention back to you. 'We're sorry Mommy, it's just... Momma Kathy is so yummy, I guess we got a little carried away,' one of your kittens kowtows, as she traces nervous circles in the walkway with her forepaws. 'May-may we please try some of your milk?' Well, you begin, letting the word hang in the air like a lure as your kitten's fix their needy expectant gazes upon you. Maybe, but you might like some privacy, this is a very personal affair after all, you add. 'Oh don't be like that dear, we're both mothers so there's nothing to be bashful about, and besides from what Ava's told me the experience will be rather enlightening for all of us,' she chuffs through a toothy jovial grin, as her thin black lips stretch back into a predatory smile. Hesitating, you wonder if perhaps you should ask her to leave, but the hungry pleading looks of your latest litter quiets such thoughts. All-and-all, what's the harm in letting her observe, you muse, beckoning your little one's to your side.";

It must have been so hard walking all the way out here, you deserve a chance to rest,' she titters, spreading her lush legs out before you as she fans her inviting tail about her well-seeded figure, impregnating the air with her soothing, motherly, catty scent. Eyeing up her pillowy thighs, and the lingering drops of alluring alabaster cream clinging to her tawny pelt like pearls floating upon on a sea of flowing molten gold, you feel your eyes drooping and any reticence you may have had ebb as a sudden pang of primal hunger simmers though your core at thought of sampling such ample fare. 'What's wrong dear, are you feeling a little hungry too?' Kathy hums, her cadance both warm and inviting as she leans back on one arm. 'Don't worry, I have plenty of milk to share with [italic type]my girl's[roman type],' she says, beckoning you forward with a luxuriant come-hither gesture. Her fecund body wobbles enticingly with her every breath as a barely audible groan emanates from her decadent D's.";
	say "     Unable to resist the tempestuous scene playing out before you, you nod, then seat your [bodydesc of Player] head in her lap, allowing her toasty pillowy thighs and downy soft pelt to cradle your catty head in their lush supportive folds. As the matronly lioness brings one her lowermost nips to your lips, she mews, 'Go on dear,' as she gives the plush orb an encouraging tender squeeze, eliciting a light trickle of lustrous alabaster ambrosia from her stiff perky teat. Spellbound by the sight of her gleaming offering, you eagerly press your muzzle to her chest, your sizable maw effortless encompassing her leaky milk spout in their loving embraces as you suckle. You're treated to a pleasant rush of warm calming fatty cream, coating your far-traveled palate in a delectable sheen of rich milky delights. Delicious, you purr under your breath as your barbed tongue explores the tight puffy contours of her tit as you drink. 'Mh such a hungry mommy,' Kathy swoons, brushing the side of her paw along your cheek, 'don't let any go to waste, you won't want to set a bad example for your cubs now would you?'";

You soon feel tiny pearls of your vivacious milk seeping from your ripening body. Rumbling happily at the sensation of pure maternal purpose coursing through you, you can't resist pawing at your supple mounds before beckoning your kittens to your breast. Purring in reply, your cubs snuggle up to your exposed chest and gratefully cup their own sizable muzzles to your [Breast size desc of Player] breasts as they drink in your tainted knowledge and experience. 'Ah, you all look so cute like this, I can't wait to share this with your brothers and sisters one day,' Kathy murmurs, eyeing her own growing brood with an odd expectant smirk.";

Only the desire to care and provide for your young holds any true meaning or place in mind, as you encouragingly pet your hungry little adorable forms. You can sense on some level your strain reacting to this potent need, as your breasts swell in tune with your kitten's demands.

Beyond accustomed to such changes, your tainted mind welcomes this pleasurable padding as all around you, your brood mews in appreciation of their mother's endless bounty as desperately suckle your [Breast size desc of Player] in the attempt to quench their thirst.

'Gosh, you're smart mom, I never would have guessed half this stuff in a billion years,' a third stammers in awe, as she fixes you with a look of profound pride, while the others simply cuddle up next to you in a show of familial feline affection. Glowing under their earnest heartfelt praise, you thank them for their loving word, before offering them one last gift. 'What's that mom? Your intellectually inclined child asks. Why, their names of course, you reply. 'Really?!' they cry in unison. Nodding, you shift your gaze to your nearest kitten, you decide to call her.";

Glancing at the remains of the noose trap coiled about its neck, a part worries the stricken creature may have been a feral, but a quick glance reveals its simple bestial nature and puts your heart at ease. Not that Drake seems to notice the brief look of concern on your face as he walks past you. His eye's set and jawed set in determined grimace as pulls almost half of the unprocessed kill behind him, as he seems utterly oblivious to your presence. Only the elated cry of Kathy and the kittens greeting the noble provider shakes his steely match towards the back of the compound.";

'Hey girls, I must of zoned out a bit there,' as he shakes head as if to clear it, 'We had a little run-in with some hyenas who thought they could take this bad boy off us,' he rumbles, giving the noose a tug. 'Lazy sh-' Drake hesitates as his citrine eyes drift toward your kittens. '*Ahem*,' he coughs, 'so-and-sos, I must still be on edge.' 'Oh that's alright dear,' Kathy beams, at the sight of her proud hunter, while she fans her tail in front of her. 'We're all grateful for you and Ava. Speaking of which, where is my sweet kitten?' the lovely lioness asks, with a note of earnest worry worming its way through her otherwise bright tone as she peers behind him. 'RIGHT HERE!' Ava shouts, from behind the wall separating The Chance from the wider world, as the outlines of her ear drift between the razor wire coiling about its edges. 'Sorry, one of the guardrails fell off the cart, and I had to tie it up before things fell out.'";

No, solid wooden cart, you correct yourself, catching sight of the pair of primitive wheels rolling behind her as she pulls the sizable contraption through the gate, stuffed to the gills with several bright blue barrels of water interspersed with multiple stacks of milk-crates full of various plants along with a few multi-colored bird eggs, all of which is held in place with a simple cord bow tied in the same manner as Ava's baby blanket. 'Ah, good job Ava. Might need to work on your knots though,' Drake comments, eyeing up the basic tie with a critical eye. 'Sure thing da- er, Drake,' Ava peeps as she unties her lower half from the crude rickshaw. 'Uh where should I put this?' she inquires, batting her tendrils towards the bundles of supplies, while gently rubbing out the creases in her fur. 'Leave it there for now, I have to process the deer before the parasites can get a chance to ruin the meat. When you get the chance though, can you wash the stuff off so we can pickle it?' he replies as he makes his way to the back of the compound with the buck in tow.";

'*Hrump*,' the big man grunts, as him and the buck drift out of sight. Ava shifts her attention back to you and the cubs saying, 'Hey everyone, sorry we're late,' as she trots over to the garden. You notice the poor girl's paws are caked in fresh dirt and her natural eyeliner seems just a tad darker. Her pelt too appears to have lost a bit of radiance, as a heavy coating of the gray-drown dust impregnating the area around the Last Chances clings to her fur like a waterlogged cloak. Briefly, you consider mentioning this, but as you observe the way your mate tries to hide her sullied paws from view, you realize she's quite aware of this.";

'Thanks [Name of Player], it's good to see you too,' Ava mews, plopping down beside you, sending a light quake through the walkway, as the wooden pathway groans under your family's combined weight. 'Oh mommy it feels too good to get off my petes,' she whimpers, rotating her left forepaw in an effort to placate some of apparent stiffness in her joints, as her poor limb loudly creaks from the effort. 'I'll say, sweetie, sounds like you two had a rough time out there,' Kathy sympathizes in a genuinely caring tone as she eyes her tired adopted daughter's dusty fur. 'Ya...' your mate sighs, her ears furling slightly, 'but,' she adds her eyes brightening at the sight of her family seated around her, 'just seeing you guys makes the trip worth it. So, how were things while I was out?' 'Great mommy Ava! We spent most of the day cuddling with momma Kathy, then mommy [Name of Player] and gave us our names,' one of your daughters exclaims.";

'Thanks everyone, but now you're just making this next part harder,' she sniffles, as she stares in your direction. 'What do you mean mom?' a third kitten inquires, tilting her head to one side. 'Well, it's time for you girls to go live with your other mother. I was hoping we'd have more time but,' she croaks almost on the edge of crying. 'Hey, don't cry mom. We know, and besides we're looking forward to traveling with mommy [Name of Player] and meeting our sisters!' a fourth kitten exclaims, as she throws her arms around Ava and gives her a loving hug.

'Oh honey, don't talk like that. It's not that hard-' Ava begins but the chorus of children's voices drowns out her words as they proclaim their desire to pitch in just like their birth mother. For a moment, your mate looks like she's about to contest them but a tender look from Kathy quiets her protest. 'Alright, just stay safe and take care of mommy [Name of Player] for me,' Ava beams, bobbing her head in your direction. 'Sure thing mom,' the fifth kitten simpers as she casts her gaze towards her siblings. 'Now come on everyone, let's go meet the others and give our moms some space,' the fifth cub concludes in a commanding tone as she leads the others off to greet their kin.";

'Thanks you two,' she rumbles, wrapping her tendrils about you both as she draws you in for a quick hug. 'I wish I could stay with you guys for a while, but I have to wash the produce for da-, I mean Drake. But when I'm done and have a chance to wash up,' she adds dusting off a section her pelt with a pat of her paws, '[Name of Player], maybe you could come see me in the garage for a little mommy time?' she swoons, pressing her paw about your middle.

Overjoyed at the sight of your little ones, you race over to greet them. You notice each appears to be hard at work scribbling away a large sheet of white paper with equally massive black quills. Tucked next to each of your kittens are some simple baby-blue paperback english and math primers that they seem to be copying from as jot they down the problems then attempt to solve. Curious and also just a tiny bit proud to see your family engaging in such scholastic activities despite all the chaos and distractions the modern world offers, you politely ask how their lessons are going. '[italic type]*SSS*[roman type] Hard,' Ava hisses, baring her fang at the page. Her eyes narrow to thin pinpricks as she taps the sharpened end of the quill along the margins. 'Sorry,' your mate sighs as she takes a deep breath to center herself, 'the kittens and I have just stuck on some of these problems for a while now.'";

I can't rely on you or [if HP of Augustus Drake is 7]daddy[else]da- I mean Drake[end if] for everything. It's not fair to either of you. Don't worry though, I'll figure this out eventually!' Ava beams, scrawling out a few lines of pre-algebra then tries to puzzle it. Unfortunately, she [one of]doesn't follow the order of operations correctly, instead defaulting to trying to solve the problem left to right[or]misinterprets a multiplication symbol for subtraction[or]forgets to properly apply an exponent[or]doesn't show her work correctly[at random], and lets out a disappointed rumble when she compares her answer to the one on the page. 'Agh! Who decided to change the way math worked?!!!' one of your kittens fumes, slamming her tail against the walkway as she makes a similar mistake. Tutting, you paw up beside her and offer to help. 'No thanks, mommy [Name of Player], [if HP of Augustus Drake is 7]grandpa[else]Drake[end if] tried and well-,' she whines, biting her lip in frustration. 'I just don't understand this stupid human stuff, it so-so GAH! None of this makes any sense,' she raves, scratching her claws through her head hair in abject bewilderment before turning to face you with a sad look in her eyes. 'I'm just dumb aren't I mom?'

The fact that she managed to figure this much out in such a short amount of time is amazing, and you will not hear a word otherwise. 'No way, it doesn't take them that long. The book says it's for twelve and up.' she huffs, tilting her head in confusion while her tail swishes behind like a broken metronome. Yes, twelve [italic type]years[roman type] and up, not hours or days, you answer in a loving tone, as you kneel down beside her and offer to walk through a few problems with her. 'No thanks, [if HP of Augustus Drake is 7]grandpa [else]Drake[end if] already tried that but he just kept talking about excusing his dear aunt Sally,' she pouts, thumping her head against the walkway in abject frustration. Saddened by the sight, you gently pet her on the back, informing her you're going to show her a special trick of your own that might help. 'Really? Well, if you think it will help, I don't mind giving it a try,' your flustered kitten mumbles, fixing you with a desperate sad look.";

Mewling happily, your diligent kitten eagerly presses her muzzle to your breast as her cute not-so-little lips tenderly latch onto one of your prominent milk spouts. A part can't help but swoon at the feeling of affectionate connection her touch brings as despite the respectable number of children you've sired with Ava. Some section of your feminine psyche is still adapting to the reality these children are yours despite the fact you weren't the one to carry them to term. Though as you lovingly stroke the back of her head while she quietly nurses in your caring embrace, you can sense that sentiment eroding as this simple seems to affirm your familial bonds in a way the lingering scraps of your human mind stuggles to parse.";

A sensation of tranquil and maternal purpose washes over like a balmy tropical tide, as the air resounds with the sound of catty contentment. You soon find your voice mixing with theirs as you hum some wordless tune to them while platonically pet their cute pelts. Your senses are awash in a sea of motherly love, while your mind is set alight with dreams of the all bright sparkling futures that could await your sweet tauric daughter's one day, along with some great names for them.";

They hardly even stop to check their work, not that they need to, every one of their answers is correct. Though you do notice that their handwriting seems to have changed as it's moved towards a close copy of your own. A part is slightly saddened by the loose of their individual flare, but you realize this is likely a result of their exposure to your own knowledge, or a desire to show their appreciation for your priceless gift.

	say "     Deciding to check up once more on your ever-growing family, you're pleasantly surprised to find the cubs and their mother seated in their usual spot in Drake's garden. This time though, instead of hitting the books, your kittens seem to be engaged in some manner of arts and crafts project. As each one of your not-so-little bundles of joy appears to be weaving a number of flowers and vines together in a tight circular band, a rather difficult task given the size of the mitts and the delicate nature of their chosen medium. Still, from the looks of proud concentration written on their sweet feline faces, along with the light happy banter passing between them as they and their mother work, your daughters seem to be enjoying themselves. Intrigued, you decide to meander on over to them and observe them in respectful silence for a while rather than risk breaking their focus. At the sound of the muted patter of your paws upon the pavement, Ava's ears perk up and swivel towards you like little fuzzy rader dishes as she sets down her work and glances in your direction, exclaiming, 'Oh hey [Name of Player]! You have great timing! We just got back from a field trip with daddy,' as your eyes met.";
	say "     Really, where did he take her and the cubs, you ask in a pleasant tone. 'To Empty Shirley,' one of your kittens sitting near the edge of the garden answers in a matter-of-fact tone, as she threads a pair of purple flowers together in flawless braid. Unfamiliar with the name, you inquire where this place is. 'Sorry, I think she means Mount Shirley,' Ava titters through a happy grin as she motions to distant the crimson peaks with a bat of her tail. 'But mom, I thought the sign said M T Shirley, doesn't that spell empty, not Mount?' your daughter replies, cocking her head at an inquisitive angle. 'Oh no dear,' your mate chuckles, fanning the air before her with tendrils. 'That's what the humans used to call an abbreviation, it's where they shorten a word or phrase,' she lectures, in a kind, matronly trill. 'Oh, I guess that makes sense,' your cub says, with a light disinterested shrug of their shoulders. 'Still,' your child continues as she looks in your direction, 'it was really nice up there mommy [Name of Player], there were so many pretty flowers and all these weird mutants. I wish you could've seen it.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     At the mere mention of mutants though, you feel the hackles rise on the back of your neck. Your lips start curling into a menacing predatory grimace alongside your simmering choler at the thought of your perfect beautiful kittens being exposed to any potential danger by a foolish little manlet. Your maternal mind is filled with a sudden desire to storm off and give the puny biped a piece of your mind; perhaps even a taste of your claws too for good measure. Yet, the feeling soon passes as your more rational side contends, that of all the people you've come across in the city, Drake probably knows how to handle himself better than most, and the mere sight of your colossal kitten's alone is a potent deterrent in and of itself. Besides, looking at their joyful smiles, you realize that you can't shelter them forever, nor should you. You muse, as another of your kittens speaks up, 'Totally mommy [Name of Player], we even brought some back for you. Grandpa showed us how to braid and preserve them, see?' your daughter simpers, as she flashes you her partially finished wreath of orange Poppies, purple Catmint, and pale white Heather flowers.";
	say "     While obviously a work in progress, you still have to admit, the thing is coming along rather nicely. The dispersion of colors flow into one another seamlessly in patterns that are both complementary and properly present, without being overwhelming to the eye. Their stems are bound in a tight weave that shows no signs of damage or creases ensuring the plants will be healthy for longer and prevent uneven browning. However, you do notice a minor aberration mixed in as a single node of smooth amber burl has been worked into one end of the braid. Its surface appears to have been lightly scored, and wedged into these tiny furrows, are the ends of cutting which seem to have somehow rooted into the mass. Curious, both at the speed at which the plants put down fresh roots, and the nature of the strange nodules, you politely ask your daughter what they are. 'These, I'm not sure but Grandpa said they called an um all lure?' Your child hesitates, and taps her pointer claw to her chin. 'No wait, allure heart,' she corrected herself, with a snap of her fingers.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A what?! You rumble, feeling your right eyelid twitch in aggravation at the idea that Drake somehow got your innocent kitten to cut out the heart of feral. 'She means Alraune,' Ava chimes in, perhaps mistaking your tone of one of confusion rather than one of righteous aggravation, 'they were these mean plant people daddy told me about, thankfully they don't seem to be around any more, but a long-long time ago before I as born.' she continues, turning her attention to the cubs. 'They started creeping down the Mountain, taking over a bunch of the old farms, and pushing people back towards the stinky city,' she says with a wave of her tendrils as her tone gets more grandiose and exuberant. 'He said they look like green skin humans almost as big as we are, with red Rose petals for hair,' she lectures, running her talon through the fur on her scalp, 'dozens of spiky tentacles on their backs kind of like ours,' Ava says, flexing her tendrils in aggressive wavy pattern before her which elicits a mix of frighten gasps and playful chuckles from the kittens. 'And their lower bodies looked like one giant pink Lotus flower that shuffled around on these huge gnarled roots,' she lectures, motion to her lower half with a casual bat of her voluminous tail.";
	say "     'According to your Grandpa, they liked to pretend they were being attacked by some kind of plant monster to lure people in, and once they got close they'd,' Ava pauses for effect as the kittens edge closer, utterly enraptured by her story, '*Rar* eat them!' She roars flashing talons and bearing fangs in a mocking predatory pose as she makes a fake overly dramatic lunge at the kittens. Earning her another round of titters and timid ohs from your little ones as they recoil in mock horror. 'Ha-ha, no way, mommy Ava, plants don't eat people,' one of your braver cubs contends, in a nonplussed treble as she rolls her eyes. 'Oh I wish that were true,' your mate mews, her ears briefly furling to the sides of her head, 'but that's not the worst of it. You see, the Alruanes could control other plants, they even used them to infect people and turn them into more Alraunes.' 'How did they do that?' Your brave cub asks, her voice somber and subdued as she warily gazes at the heart tucked into her wreath.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Well, you see I uh-,' Ava rumbles, twiddling a pair of her thumbs as she stares demurely up at the sky, 'never really asked your Grandpa about that part much, but it had something to do with these hearts,' Ava replies, brandishing her own floral project. 'If you leave them alone too long they grow into um... oh mommy now what did he call them?' She blushes, her voice ripe with embarrassment as she bobs her head side-to-side. 'Corpse Lilies, that put these huge ugly black roots into the ground which burrowed into other plants, filling them to the brim with silver hair thingies.' Filaments? You interject. 'Ya that's the word, so the firmaments, gah!' Ava grumbles, flicking the side of her head with her tail, 'I mean fil-a-ments, let them see everything around these plants, and move some of them around like puppets,' she says, gently coiling her tendrils about the stems of a few poppies. Your mate makes a show of swiveling the flower about like organic searchlights.";
	say "     'Sometimes though, they'd infest a piece of fruit like an apple or peach and anyone who ate them would turn into a crazed carrier that would try to spread them even further,' your mate lectures, making a sweeping gesture with her paws towards the wider plains as she loses her hold on the plants. 'Wow, how did Grandpa get rid of them then?' yet another of your brood inquiries. 'He didn't do it alone, a number of surviving farmers and some of his old friends teamed up and set fire to a huge swath of the plains. From what daddy told me, the blaze pushed them back towards the mountain and made room for a lot of the grasses to come back. After a while, they started infighting till the military shelled them, whatever that means,' Ava shrugs. 'Since then no one's seen them, though you can still find some hearts growing in the ash like we did, and daddy says there are still a few tainted plants out there, which is why,' your mate prompts, fixing your children with a studious glare.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'We don't eat food we find in the wild unless you or Grandpa says it's safe,' your kittens reply in unison though with varying degrees of enthusiasm. 'Good girls!' your lover mews. Nodding along, you politely inquire what she's doing with these [']Hearts['] then if they're so dangerous. 'Oh right, er, daddy says we need to prune them to prevent the Alraunes from coming back, and if pick while their still young like this,' your mate beams, proudly brandishing the heart woven into her wreath, 'we can graft plants to preserve them since their sap is supposed to be super yummy. Some farms around here have even made a special fertilizer by mixing them with swamp water, ash, and manure. I don't really understand how it works, but daddy says it has something to do with the nanites [']Petra-forming['] the area around the reservoir back into a wetland.' Not bothering to correct her this time, you instead ask how she or Drake know any of this is safe though. 'Um, because Daddy said so silly!' Ava replies with fervor of the newly converted as she proudly thumps her fist against her breast.";
	say "     Though a part of you wants to contest her borderline tautological assertion, the man has been surviving out here more or less on his own, and likely knows more than most about the local hazards then you, so for the moment at least you decide to defer to Ava's judgment. Perhaps one day when you're alone, you might ask her and Drake more about this in greater detail, as you'd rather not undermine Ava's or Drake's authority in front of your kittens. Instead, you simply nod along, murmuring in vague agreement as you sit yourself beside them and watch your family work. As the minutes stretch on, you observe the final forms of your kitten projects take shape as they weave the number of wrist, ankle and headbands from their collection of flowers. Though the patterns vary from wreath to wreath, the lovely difference seems to reflect the budding personalities of your little ones. A few have even inlay bits of rock or smooth shards of hand polished glass into their designs. While others have added polished lengths of copper wire likely found out on the Dry Plains into there's.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     All and all, the sight of your young artists['] works brings a smile to your face as they take turns showing them off to you and explaining the significance of each little knot or alteration. Naturally, you praise each one a priceless work of art they are, and do your best to offer helpful critiques, though you doubt your perfect angels need the advice. The doting looks on their adorable catty faces as they hang on to your every word nevertheless warms your heart. When Ava comes forward to show you hers, you note the simple wreath of white poppies laced with yellow snapdragons and copper wire is far smaller than the others. In truth, you doubt Ava could even wear the thing on the thinnest spot of her tail, yet before you can give voice to these thoughts, your mate chimes in, saying, 'This one's for you [Name of Player]. I um hope it's in your size, I kind of had to ball eye it.' Eyeball it, you correct her with a light chuckle as you place the cute not-so-little wreath on the top of your catty head. Much to your surprise, the thing fits rather neatly between your ears, although it is a touch snug in place, at least you don't have to worry about it blowing away in a strong breeze.";
	say "     You adopt a few playful poses for your family while asking how you look. 'Stunning,' one of your kittens mews. 'Adorable,' another simpers. 'Super cute,' a third rumbles. 'Positively radiant,' Ava purrs, as a choir of praise echoes around you. Almost blushing with joy, you thank them for their kind words and their sweet gift, before offering a treat of your own. You roll on your side, exposing your many tiers of your lush [Breast Size Desc of Player] breasts and gleefully stroke the luxurious fur swaddling the bountiful hills and valleys of [bodydesc of player] body's curves. Reveling at the feeling of your soft fur gliding along your pads, you invite your little ones to partake of your milk and accrued wisdom. Mewling with unvarnished delight, your kittens eagerly take their places next to you, cupping their ecstatic lips to your perky nips.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Your body and mind are flooded with the comforting sound of their elated purrs alongside a heady rush of maternal hormones. Chuffing contentedly, you lazily pet and caress your kittens sizable snoots with tendrils as they nurse. You hardly even notice Ava cuddling up behind you as she drapes her arms over your shoulders. Your fluffy mate lovely hugs your upper body to hers, swaddling your body in her rows of plump M-cups, remarking, 'Aw, just look at them. I'm so glad I can share this moment with you,' as she nuzzles her chin along the tips of your ear. Nodding, you express a similar sentiment, as the two of you brainstorm some names for your girls together while your little ones feed.";

Overjoyed at the sight of your little ones, you race over to greet them. You notice each appears to be hard at work scribbling away at a large sheet of white paper with equally massive black quills. Tucked next to each of your kittens are some simple baby-blue paperback english and math primers that they seem to be copying from as jot they down the problems then attempt to solve. Curious and also just a tiny bit proud to see your family engaging in such scholastic activities despite all the chaos and distractions the modern world offers, you politely ask how their lessons are going.

'No thanks, mommy [Name of Player], [if HP of Augustus Drake is 7]grandpa[else]Drake[end if] and well-,' she whines, biting her lip in frustration. 'None of this monkey stuff any makes,' she raves, scratching her claws through her head hair in abject bewilderment before turning to face you with a sad look in her eyes. 'I mean I can speak just fine, so why is writing so hard?!'

'No thanks,[if HP of Augustus Drake is 7] grandpa[else] Drake[end if] already tried that but he just kept rambling about FANS BOYS and eyes seeing eyes,' she pouts, thumping her head against the walkway in abject frustration. Saddened by the sight, you gently pet her on the back, informing her you're going to show her a special trick of your own that might help. 'Really?

A part can't help but swoon at the feeling of affectionate connection her touch brings as despite the respectable number of children you've sired with Ava. Some section of your feminine psyche is still adapting to the reality these children are yours despite the fact you weren't the one to carry them to term.

They hardly even stop to check their work, not that they need to, every one of their answers is correct.

Padding up to greet them, you notice your little ones and their mother are seated in a half circle around Drake who seems to be in the middle of some kind of survival lesson. At least that's what you surmise, watching him gesturing to a number of large piles of mismatched timber mixed with reclaimed wood, pieces of flint, lengths of twine, and a sandwich bag full of clear water set beside your kitten's forepaws. 'Alright girls, now that you got your supplies we're going to practice making cooking fires-,' the man begins, only to hesitate as he sees you pawing towards them. 'Assuming your other mother is fine with this,' the patriarchal man inquires with casual wave of his hand toward you as your kittens turn around and fix you with pleading gazes. 'Oh please can we mommy [Name of Player]?! We worked super hard to get all these, and we promise to be careful,' a few of them mew.";
	say "     Unable to say no to such polite cute kittens, you bob your head in the affirmative and motion for him to continue as you can't see the harm in your cubs learning such a useful skill. Especially in such a safe place like the parking lot where there's a very little risk of the blaze spreading, you ruminate as you take a seat on the pavement.' *Ahem* right,' Drake coughs into his left hand and starts pacing before them as he inspect each pile, 'first things first, we need to go over what types of wood are safe to burn. Buckeye for instance,' he rumbles, picking up a lump of pale brown and smoky gray timber about the size of a grown man's forearm from one of your kitten's piles, 'smells like rotten meat when it burns.' 'Ew really?' your kitten grumbles as she stares glumly at the hunk of dry wood clutched in Drake's hand. 'Yes hun, but it's very lightweight,' Drake adds as he effortlessly balances the length timber on his pinkie, 'and a lot of people like to carve the burl on these.' The big man lectures as he set the piece down adjacent to the walkway, then strides over to the kitten's bundle.";

	say "     'Of course, there are some woods that are outright toxic like this Eucalyptus here,' he intones, plucking a misshapen square of light red tinted wood from a second kitten's collection. 'A few good whiff of the smoke from this,' he taps his thumb against the side of the thing, 'could land someone in the emergency room, the tree's still have some uses though, and it can be a good way to find underground pockets of water out on the plains. Now do you remember where you found the tree that came from dear?' Drake asks, as shows the bit of offending kindling to each of your kittens. 'Yes sir,' your second kitten replies through a proud smirk. 'Good girl, if you or the others ever get lost or separated from your mom near there, now you know how to find water,' the big man says, setting the nubbin of wood on the ground beside the buckeye, then continues his lecture as stride over to a third kitten pile. 'Right some more stuff you have to watch out for, this,' he says, picking what looks like a square sun-bleached table leg.";
	say "     'Varnished or treated wood, like Eucalyptus, will ruin your food, and your lungs if you breathe in the fumes,' the patriarchal post-human intones, as he points to a few telltale marks of old preservatives still clinging to the wood. 'Ah sorry grandpa, it looked dry so I thought, well you know,' your third kitten rumbles sheepishly as she tucks her arms and tendrils behind her back in a show of contrition. 'That's alright, I never told you ladies what to avoid, besides, got an old broken stool in back that could use a new leg about this size,' the big man says, making a show of examining the length of lumber. 'Really?' your third kitten, ask rather hopefully. 'Yes dear, you did good,' Drake replies, his voice brimming with warmth and reassurance as he places the odd sundry next to the other rejected pieces as goes through the others pulling out a dozen potentially hazardous pieces of wood, adding each to the stack of rejects. 'Right, now I want you girls to go through your timber piles and pull out anything that matches the stuff I just showed you,' Drake concludes as he takes a seat on the walkway.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Yes sir,' your kittens reply in unison as they set about sorting their piles in rapid succession. Mere moments later, they've paired down the timber then invite you and Drake to inspect their work. Nodding, you both sift through the remaining lumber, finding everything in order, you step back a respectful distance and let the man continue his lesson. 'Alright girls, now for the fun part, you all remember those fire starting techniques I showed you on the trail?' the big man asks, motioning to a collection of implements at their paws. Your girls grin and nod as they take up their tools. 'Good, each one of you pair with your neighbor and show them what I taught you. It'll be good practice for when you meet up with siblings later, and Ava?' he says, casting his firm gaze in your mate's direction. 'Yes daddy?' she replies, with a confused trill at being singled out. 'You're in-charge, but if you need any help,' he smiles, returning to his seat on the walkway, 'I'm right here.'";
	say "     'Thanks dad,' your mate simpers as she takes his place at the [']head['] of the class. 'Ok everyone, let's make mommy [Name of Player] and Grandpa proud and show them what we've learned!' she cheers, pumping her fist into the as your kids break into groups of two and take turns setting up their own firepits. Their attempts are a little clumsy looking at first, but in no time at all your kitten's have cobbled together eight roaring, but well-contained blazes. 'GOOD JOB GIRLS! You're all dang quick studies, as a reward I'm gonna show you all one of the best things you can cook on a campfire,' the man pauses, his lips curling back into a regal lionine grin, 's'mores!' 'Wha-what's that grandpa?' your third kitten queries, with an inquisitive flick of her tail. 'Well just sit tight kids, let me grab Kathy and we'll show ya,' Drake chuffs, bobbing his head towards his lover's room as he darts up the stairs and into her room.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Seconds later, he ducks out through the door with the portly lioness perched on his left shoulder as the two of them descend, their arms laden with huge bags of multi-colored marshmallows, different flavors of chocolate, graham crackers, paper plates, tongs, and a collection of oversized silvery metal skewers. As they stride back over to you and your brood, Ava leans in and whispers in your ear, 'Hey [Name of Player], um what are s'mores? Daddy's never mentioned them before.' Chuckling, you whisper they're one of, if not the greatest confections humanity has ever, and likely will ever produce. 'Wow,' she swoons, her eyes glimmering with pure wonder and earnest awe, 'they must be super valuable then, I didn't know daddy had anything like that here.' Shaking your head, you tell her they're not really valuable, at least in the monetary sense. Their real worth is sharing them with the people you love, as you tenderly press your soft cuddly body against her shoulder, delighting at the touch of her satin fur and calming alpine scent titillating your senses.";
	say "     'That sounds so sweet, I can't wait to try them with you,' your mate purrs, hooking her tendrils about your waist and she pulls you close with a gentle loving tug. Humming happily at her touch, you express a similar sentiment as you lean into her supple embrace. All the while, your cubs sit patiently around the campfires as Drake and Kathy walk between them passing out plates full of random sweets and skewers to your little ones. Though a few of your more impatient kittens try to eat them on the spot, a warning tut from their adopted grandmother keeps them in line while the big man explains the simple [']recipe'['] to your perfect little angels. Nodding along, your quick-witted kittens spend the next few minutes politely trading different colors of marshmallow and flavors of chocolate amongst themselves before breaking into groups nestled next to their fires and set to work on their sugary delights. Observing their work, you hardly even notice Drake and Kathy paw up beside you carrying what's left of the treats.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Aw, you two have some of the most well-mannered cubs I've ever seen. Why the humans could learn a thing or two from them,' the matronly cat girl quips as Ava leans down and takes a large bag of plain-looking sweets from her adopted mother. Though part of you feels a touch slighted at the banal selection, looking at the blissful expression of your children as they arrange their own prismatic confections, then to the now empty arms of your host's as you realize they've given everything to you and your kids. You decide against voicing such self-centered thoughts as your mate chirps, 'Thanks mom,' while kneeling down to take the plate for her mother's tiny paws. 'But,' she pauses, as eyes flicker between her adoptive parents, 'aren't you guys going to have some too? It feels wrong to have these all to ourselves,' Ava adds as she tries passing the plate back to her adopted mother. 'Oh don't worry about us,' Kathy beams, waving aside the offered platter with a flick of her tail, 'these are for you and your family, isn't that right Draky?' Kathy simpers, as gazes up at her lover.";
	say "     'She's right Ava,' he rumbles, kneeling down beside his mate. He hooks his left arm around the cuddly lioness and gently rubs her tummy fur. 'Your mother and I are both so proud of you and your kids. You've all been quite the help around the grounds, you deserve a treat.' 'But daddy, [Name of Player] said s'mores are meant to be shared with the people you love, it doesn't feel right to keep them to ourselves, not after all you've done for me.' your mate sniffles, fixing the big man with a pleading glance. 'Oh? She did?' the post-human chuffs, flashing you a respectful glance. 'Well alright Ava, just one though, I have something special waiting for your mom on the roof and don't want you spoiling her appetite,' Drake chuckles, as you hear a slight groan coming from his jeans as the stiff old denim strains against his statuesque form as he returns to a standing position. 'Mh, and whatever might that be dear?' Kathy smirks, her ears twitching with obvious interest, as she eyes a growing crease in the folds of his right pants leg.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Heh, you'll see babe,' the big man says as he leads the three of you over to one of the less crowded firepits. Your group's arrival is greeted with a series of happy mews as your kittens make way and show off the unique blends of sugary delight they created. Praising each one as the peerless culinary excellence that they are, you and Ava nestle your lower halves together like a pair of cuddly crescents as the big kitty drapes her soft not-so-little paws over your [bodydesc of player] body and lightly pulls you into her loving embrace. Internally swooning at the caress of her silky fur and the plush body, you allow yourself to be drawn into her pillowy arms while Kathy settles herself on her mate's lap. Your kittens pass Ava and Drake a pair of unused skewers along with a few colorful treats of theirs. Though your lover and her adoptive father try to say no, your cubs won't hear a word of it and soon yield to your altruistic little ones['] demands and add a few green, pink, gold marshmallows to the mix then set them next to the fire.";
	say "     As they cook, you find your gaze drifting between the various groups of your cubs huddled around their own little blazes. You can't help but feel a swell of maternal pride growing in your breast at having brought nearly a hundred or so of these perfect angels into this crazy flexible world. At any other time in your life, you might have found the very idea that you'd [']mother['] so many laughable, yet as you stare at their beautiful pelts shimmering in fire light, and listen to the sweet musical choir of their voices as they chatter amongst themselves. It's getting harder to see yourself as anything other than the matronly mommy taur that you've grown into. Besides, what more could you want in life than a wonderful mate, a caring family, and this bountiful tauric body? You muse, almost totally lost in your thoughts as Ava absentmindedly paws at,[if Player is impreg_now] the soft swell of your latest litter[else] the tender void of your poor vacant tum[end if] with her tendrils.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The loss of something as silly and inconsequential as your humanity seems like such a small price to pay for all the joy this experience has brought you. Perhaps picking up on this serene line of thought, you feel your lover nuzzle her chin along the top of your head whispering, 'Gosh don't they look so perfect and happy together?' Yes, you coo in agreement, sinking deeper into her comforting many-limbed embrace, delighting at the sensation of your mate's soft body swaddling you, and the sight of your ever-growing brood. 'There's so many of them too, I can't believe I was alone for so long, but now,' she purrs dreamily, gesturing to your little ones both near and abroad with a casual wave of her tendrils. 'I have you, mommy, daddy, and all my beautiful kittens, by my side. All [italic type]our[roman type] kittens, you correct her with a good-natured tut, as you reach up and gently stroke her cheeks. 'Mh...ours, I like it when you say that,' Ava rumbles in a deep catty bass, as she nuzzles her sizable whiskers against your palms.";
	say "     A sudden cough from Drake gets your attention, as he frantically gestures to the sizzling carbonized mess that was once your marshmallows, saying, 'Uh hey girls your food's burning!' as he plucks the charred confection from the blaze before they smolder away to nothing. 'Shoot! Sorry dad we were just, well,' your mate mews demurely, flashing the big man a well-meaning blep. 'It's okay Ava, I know,' he rumbles in an all too feline octave, coiling his free arm around Kathy protectively as he hands Ava the prodigious skewer. 'You were just... lost in the moment,' he adds, with a tender too-toothy smile as he nuzzles his chin along the tips of Kathy's ears. 'Thanks Dra-, I mean Daddy,' Ava beams, taking the length of metal from him as she proceeds to skin the burnt layer of fluffy over-caramelized sugar off her treats and quickly assembles a pair of s'mores just for you and her. 'Here you go my sweet mate,' she simpers, passing you one of the comparatively tiny treats. Accepting it with an earnest smile, you dig in, and internally remark that while the crackers are a tad stale, the chocolate barely has any coca in it, and the marshmallow tastes just a hair burned, it's still one of the best things that you've eaten in recent memory.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Mh delicious,' she mews, between delighted smacks of her lips, 'could use some milk though.' She notes, motioning to her lush tiers of verdant M-cup breasts. At the mere mention of milk, your kittens['] ears seem to perk up as they turn to face you and your beloved mate, their expressions alight with hopeful pleading glances. Ah, are you girls thirsty too? You inquire in a jovial sing-song trill. 'Yes mommy [Name of Player], may I please have some milk?' your first kitten asks. 'Ya, could I please have some too? The s'more were super yummy, but they were kind of sticky. I think I have some stuck between my teeth,' your second kitten says, as they point to the back of their maw with a flick of their tail. Of course, you tell them as you invite your kittens to your side, eager both to share your wisdom with them and to experience the feeling of sublime connection the act of feeding them imparts. Nodding to the crowd around you, Drake scoops Kathy up into his arms whispering something to her about giving you and Ava some space.";
	say "     For a moment, she looks like she wants to protest, but as he pulls her to his hardened chiseled pecs, such thoughts are short-lived though as the plush motherly lioness mewls happily as she is carried off to the roof, likely for her own [']treat['] as Drake put it. You titter internally, as you spread yourself out and implore your kittens to drink their fill. At once your kittens rushes forward in an orderly tide of fluffy perfection, as they lovingly cup their sweet lips to your elated nips, and sup deeply from your boundless bounty as they purr delightedly to one another. While they drink, your mind is set awash with feeling purest parental love, and desire to care for them, along with a sudden rush of inspiration of names for the cubs.";

Even those are slowly being worn away by the low gusts wafting through the gaps in the gate. Brief as it was, you hope the memory of simple dalliance stays with kittens for years to come. A part of you wonders if they'll get another chance like this, as they cuddle around you and your mate in an adorable pile of satiated catty contentment.

Their tails twitch with an eager energy as the same desire you often feel to explore tries to rouse them from their comfy place at yours and Ava's side, the well-mannered kittens seem to resist the potent urge for the moment. Yet for all the anticipation written upon their body language as flex their talons, or idly shuffle their legs, they remain snuggled up beside you, waiting for the moment you say it's time to leave, meet the rest of their family, and see all the wonders of this new world. You briefly consider giving the word, but as you lay here cuddled in your mate's loving arms, you just can't find the strength to do so.

Once they dip out of sight, you can feel Ava deflate slightly as wraps her arms around you protectively and nuzzles her chin along the top of your catty head, whispering. 'Gosh I'm going to miss them, it so nice to have them around, but they can't stay locked up here,' she sniffles, briefly tucking her ears to the side of her head. 'They deserve to see the world with you... I just wish I could too.' Tutting, you tell her that she can always come with, and there's plenty of space at The Bunker.

Laid out across the bench, is what looks to be a reinforced door of an armored car, a welding kit, several unmarked gas canisters, and a large red fold-out steel tool box. Alongside several lime-green plastic cases placed around its feet, though their labels have been worn away by time, you still make out a few words like angle grinder or rotary saw on a couple of them. Curious about his project, you paw up beside him, and ask what he's working on. 'Ah [Name of Player], just the woman I was hoping to see,' Drake replies, with an acknowledging bob of his head. 'Got a commission from a trade partner of mine coming to visit soon,' he pauses to rap the door with his knuckles. 'Guy wants me to turn this thing into a sort of riot shield for him, so was wondering if you could take Kathy and Ava to the beach for the day?' Drake says, somewhat dryly, though you can't help but note a mild undercurrent of urgency tugging at his otherwise neutral tone as he eyes the girls['] rooms. Tilting your catty head at an inquisitive angle, you rightly ask the patriarchal man why.";

'I-,' he hesitates, lightly clicking his tongue, 'I feel bad disturbing them.' Nodding, you tell him that's very considerate of him, but he isn't worried about the mutants that live there. 'Nah,' he chuffs through a relaxed grin, 'been there a few times, just don't go past the Break Water, or piss off the crab. Besides, you can handle yourself better than most, seen you crack a few skulls out there,' he motions towards the plains and wider city beyond The Chance's heavily fortified gates with a commanding nod of his head, 'even in your condition. I know you can keep the girls safe, if it comes to it.' Shrugging, you tell him that's true, a little thing like pregnancy is never gonna slow you down. 'Good, so you feel up for it?' he asks.";

'Great, before you go,' Drake pauses to fish a handful of plastic notes with a silver paperclip affixed to their corners out of his pant's pocket. Counting them out, he continues, saying, 'Here, I hate using it myself, but have some freecred. Don't know why, but folks are using this over dollars now, so if you or the girls see any good stands at the beach, my treat,' as he tosses them to you. Plucking them out of the air, you tell him you'll keep that in mind and head off to collect Ava, while Drake goes upstairs to get Kathy. Pawing up to her room, you politely knock on your mate's door before letting yourself in. Once inside, your catty eyes are met with the adorable sight of your plush pregnant lover reclining upon her mattress while her paws comfortably laze upon the pillowy mass of her flush dugs. Seemingly oblivious to your presence, Ava's attention is solely focused on a large children's picture book resting atop the supple swell of creamy middle while she reads aloud to your precious kittens.";

Ava's ears begin to twitch as she suddenly turns her head to face you. 'Oh hey [Name of player], sorry I didn't hear you come in, guess I was a little too caught up in reading to the girls,' she purrs, giving her tummy fur an affectionate rub with her forepaws. Smirking at the cute little impression of her paws gliding over her pelt, you tell her that's alright, then ask what she's reading. 'Blue Cheese And Spam,' she says, setting the book coverside down beside herself as she rolls over onto her paws. 'Daddy bought it and a few others for me yesterday. Ya know, I think the girls really like it,' she mews resting her hands on her glowing tum. Aw how sweet of him, you simper before mentioning that Drake would like to speak with her in the parking lot. 'Mh, oh ok,' Ava shrugs. 'Come on girl lets go and see grandpa,' she hums, waddling to her feet as she ambles outside with you in tow.";

As both are apparently very happy to be away from construction noise and getting to see the ocean for the first time. Although your mate is initially a little distressed at the idea of leaving The Chance, once she realizes that it will be without him, but once you remind her that you'll be escorting her, her concerns melt away under a tsunami of renewed enthusiasm. The matter settled and with nothing to pack beyond a set of oversized and regular beach blankets Drake had tucked away, you quickly bundle the massive sheets of white cloth on the small of Ava's back then set Kathy atop her before setting off."; [Note to Prome: this is one of my oldest pieces of writing and I was skipping dialogue here because it would bloat the event and it would lead to the PC talking too much.

Though you're not exactly sure if such vigilance is required, you can't say that you blame the big man for it, you muse. Still, the three of you make good time, as yours and Ava's tauric bodies are able to cover ground far quicker than a pathetic biped. The local mutants keep their distance too; even as you pass Trevor labs and other hot spots few, if any, of the city's less social inhabitants come within earshot of you. As you go along, the three of you pass the time by pointing out places you've been or seen. Many of them have seen better days, and you often find yourself telling your travel mates what places were like before the outbreak.";

After a while, you give up on it all together, realizing that despite the chaos caused by the nanites, the [']mother-daughter['] pair wouldn't exist as they are now without them. The more you attempt to exalt the wonders of a world free of the nanite plague, the more sour their expressions become. They finally perk up though when you pass the great bronze crab keeping watch over the shore, and reach the beach plaza proper. Standing on the edge of the boardwalk, the three of you spare a moment to take in the sight of the pristine blue water stretching out as far as the eye can see, framed by the vast rocky outcropping, clean yellow sand dunes, and the gentle waves lap at the shore. One could easily forget about the outbreak, were it not for the sizable population of friendly mutants milling about the area, or the subtle silhouettes of birds alongside the occasional siren flying out towards the break water. Drinking in the view, the girls loose a series of oohs and aahs at the sight, and a few low scoffs at the smell.";
			say "     One of the downsides of having sensitive noses, you muse, unbothered by the salty air. 'Wow, I've never seen so much water,' Ava says, her eyes alight with catty wonder as she motions to the vast ocean with a casual wave of her tendrils. 'Or smelled so much salt, and mh fish.' Kathy chuckles over the sound of her tummy rumbling as she dismounts. Eh you get used to it, you confide with a neutral shrug, besides there's more to the beach than the water. 'Like what?' Ava asks, fixing you with an inquisitive stare while her ears twitch at odd angles as she takes in the new sounds wafting about her. Why there's food, making sand castles, nice hiking trails, and, you gesture to the bikini clad post-human woman playing volleyball at the water's edge, the view. 'Naughty kitty,' Ava teases, lightly pinching your elbow fur. 'Mh, I can see the appeal, but I think I like the men more though,' Kathy titters, ogling some of the more endowed male mutants bouncing banana hammocks as they frolic in the surf. 'Oh can imagine what it would be like to slap one of those on Drake,' she mews wistfully as lucid speckles of drool pool around the edges of her boxy muzzle. 'Now uh what was this I heard about food,' Kathy asks, licking her chops.";

			say "     Right, you begin, gesturing to the pathways leading to the boardwalk, so down there, is a snack shack. From what you can recall, they sell ice cream that would be perfect for a day like this. Of course, you're buying, you titter, waving for them to follow. 'Oh I remember that stuff for the circus, I've always wanted to try some. Say Ava, did they have that at the fair?' Kathy asks as the trio of you meander down the causeway. 'Um,' Ava pauses as she thoughtfully taps her catty chin, 'I think I saw a few melted otter pops laying around, but they looked kind of... cloudy though so I never tried them,' she shrugs. Well then the two of them are in for a treat, you exclaim as you lead them over to the long queue. Bounding down the stairways, the assembled beach goers hurriedly part ways like the tide for your group on your way down to the public beach. You don't blame them though, as the sight of two massive gravid tauresses towering head and shoulders above the crowd (minus the tiny portly feline waddling between you) is an intimidating sight, others though, seem rather taken with your form.";
			say "     The attention isn't all bad either, as somehow despite all your changes, knowing your still someone's fetish is oddly affirming, you muse as you proudly strut through the churning mass of post-humans. Once you fall in line, a few of the more curious women are naturally drawn to your group and ask the usual questions. How far along are you, who's the daddy, and if they can have a feel. Nothing you haven't heard before, and you don't mind indulging some of their queries as you wait in line. After all, you're quite proud of the way you look, especially since you worked hard to earn this beautiful body. Besides, the look of shock on their faces is beyond priceless once you reveal who the [']father['] is. Not that you blame them, it's not often a woman gets knocked by her girlfriend, even in this crazy day and age. A few of the cuter ones you even allow to touch your lovely bump, as you have to admit it does feel nice to be the center of such attention.";

			say "     Especially since a couple of the local vixens are very good with their paws as they carefully caress your taut tums while commenting on the wondrous glow of your fur. You don't even mind when one of them sneaks a quick kiss to your outie. Of course, you play it off as a happy accident, lest anyone get any ideas. Ava however, is a stuttering mess, as she does her best to ward off onlookers as they fawn over her exotic form, to little avail. However, a quick catty rumble soon sends them packing, as you bare your fangs in a menacing predatory grimace while the fur on your back ripples in bestial aggravation. Kathy on the other paw, has a more mercenary approach to things, charging people on a by-the-touch basis, she doesn't discriminate between male, herm, or female either. If they have the creds they can cop a feel wherever they want. Otherwise, she remains cool and aloof to the broke ones, who are soon pushed aside by the churning tide of eager metamorphs desperate to indulge themselves on her opulent body.";

Their replacement though, is a green scaled bipedal horned lizard girl wearing nothing but a smile. Well at least you won't have to worry about finding a hair in your food, you think to yourself as you eye her up. You're immediately reminded of lizard girls in the park, but you notice some obvious differences. Her jet black horns are swept back to the sides and her eyes have a subtle glow to them. While the dense scales coating her body are a tad darker green edging towards olive or ebony than the blue-green hues you've seen in the park. In places you can even see hints of thick bony spikes growing along her extremities. Her tits too are a tad larger, as her supple mounds are erring towards lush D-cups, then the petite A's found on the park dwelling reptiles.

Purring in agreement, you drum your claws along your glowing treasure trail, basking at the sensation of your talons playing across your powerful ripening form.

They look too comfy, and besides, some would consider it a crime to disturb sleeping cats. You muse, recalling an old, somewhat famous painting of a Japanese woman cutting her kimono with a sword to avoid waking her cat. Still, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself a bit as gently pet the tired kitties['] silky fur while listening to the sounds of the ocean. Lost in your simple pleasures, you hardly even notice the muted crunching of sand of several people pawing behind you until one calls out in a delightfully girly voice, 'Aw, how cute, look at them all cuddled up like that!'

Two of them appear fully mutated, not to mention completely nude. The woman to your left resembles some manner of harpy, although her feathers have been dyed bright pink with blue fringes and silver geometric runes have been drawn on them. Despite your travels and odd dealings with the city's many exotic inhabitants, none of these unusual symbols resemble any language you've seen before. Mostly likely, you muse, they're just scribbles whose meaning is something known only to the harpy. Though as your eyes drift further south, you note that unlike many of her sisters squawking around the city, she appears to have not one, but three puffy cunts, nestled in row along her smooth alabaster nethers. Compared to the more waspish avians you've encountered, her plush E-cup tits and gropable hips are also noticeably larger than what you've seen on her less endowed kin.";

Her largest being D-cup and smallest are B-cups, while a billowing orange fox tail tipped with a cream splotch of fur twitches behind her. Flanking them is a rare sight, a completely unaltered dark haired human with newly tanned skin standing about five foot six inches tall with a single pair of AA-cups. Despite the rest of her cliques['] preference for nudity, this woman has decided to wear a blue one piece swimsuit. Given the coverage, it's not outside the realm of possibility that she's hiding a minor mutation underneath.

'Am not!' the human stammers with a low squeak, crossing her arms defensively.

I didn't know your friends were sleeping though, so if this is a bad time...' the harpy says, tracing the sand with a toe claw as her voice trails off. Shrugging, you tell her not to worry, you were already debating on whether to not wake up your mates. Though at the sound of your voice, the girls let out a low yawn as they stretch out and wipe the sleep from their eyes while looking upon the assembled humans standing before them with open curiosity.

T-th-then how did you do that!' Becky says excitedly as she bowls past her friends to get closer to you.

Don't make fun of me,' the odd ape whines struggling in her arms. '*Sigh* we're not making fun of you Beck, we're just trying to keep you from making an ass of yourself,' Lilly says, furling her brow as she steps between you and her friend.

Not sure if you've heard of them, but they gave us booster shots, nanite collectors, and a bunch of other cool stuff to help us gather samples of all the ferals wandering the city in exchange for college credits. Thing is, we're not all that tough, so we kind of just... submitted to everything and collected the juices afterwards. Of course, these two,' Becky sternly motions to her colleagues, 'decided it would be fun to get knocked up once they learned about the whole accelerated pregnancy thing and started posting videos of themselves knocked up online with their dad's satellite phones they smuggled in, against Zehphyr policy.'";

Initially perplexed at the unusual aromas, you swiftly realize that your mate must have given birth not all that long ago, however that doesn't explain her absence. You muse, with a light shake of your head as you hurriedly bound over to the lobby in the hopes that Drake might shed some light on what's going on. Ducking inside, you spy the big man hunched over the counter with his disassembled rifle spread out before him alongside a number of oily rags, bristly black pipe cleaners, glass bowls full of screws and foul smelling solvents, alongside a silvery well-worn multi tool.";
	say "     Seemingly unbothered by your frantic appearance, Drake merely glances in your direction for but a moment, saying, 'Looking for Ava and the girls?' in a dry tone as he fiddles with the trigger of his tank killer. Nodding, you rightly ask where her and your littles ones are. 'Out,' the big man shrugs as takes out a oily rag from somewhere behind the counter and begins polishing the trigger assembly. Raising an inquisitive eyebrow, you ask if he's serious, as Ava's never struck you as the adventurous type. 'Mh,' he nods, 'but the girls have been getting her to go out more,' Drake answers flatly while turning the bit of metal over in his grease-stained hands as he inspects it. And he's not worried about them? 'Well,' he chuffs, as he set down the now gleaming material on the counter before continuing, 'I was, the first few times she went out, but the kids are tougher than you give them credit for [name of Player],' he beams, proudly puffing out his chiseled chest so that the silky white fabric of his t-shirt stretches just a hair tighter along his herculean core. 'Besides, they got flare guns, tasers, and a few spears if anything goes wrong.' Huffing, you nevertheless inquire what they're doing out in the wastes though.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Gardening,' the big man grins as he reaches for the barrel of rifle and large pipe cleaner wrapped in an oily rag. Gardening, out there in dry plains, all alone, you parrot while audibly tapping your talons along the floor. 'Ya,' he grunts, running the length of his cleaner along the inside of his gun's muzzle. And he's not worried about them? 'Course I am,' he grumbles, mouth curling into a predatory grimace as his growing fangs peek out the side of lips, 'but the girls need this experience, we can't keep them cooped up here forever.' But-, you begin only to have him cut you off. 'Look [name of Player], I'm worried about them too!' he snarls. 'But,' he paues to take a steadying breath, 'they got this and we... we need the extra food.' Curious, you ask what he means, even the quickest growing crops take weeks, if not months before they're ready. 'Ya,' he chuffs with a subtle shrug, 'but the nanites seem to be accelerating their growth, and you remember those Alraune hearts the girls and I harvested a while back?' Nodding, you reply in the affirmative. 'Well, the girls have been mixing the sap from those with swamp water, and mountain ash to get their own little fields growing all across the plains.'";
	say "     But why not grow them here, you question. 'Not enough water, and the soils gone bad after I well,' Drake pauses to nod toward the burnt stretches of grass beyond the gate. Oh, you rumble recalling Ava's story about the big guy setting fire to plains to beat back the infected plants. '*Hmp*,' he murmurs with a dejected shake of his head as if to banish the memory, 'so way I hear it, they found a few aquifers and seeps out on the plains then set up shop. Took them a while, but they're already bringing a lot of wheat, fruits, and nuts. Couple of them have even started bartering with the neighbors for meat and eggs,' Drake adds with a proud smirk. Impressive, yet this still doesn't explain why no one bothered to tell you this, you huff. 'Well, the girls wanted it to be a surprise, so,' he grumbles like an old tom cat, 'don't let them know I ruined it when they come back. You're welcome to wait here while I finish these calibrations, could use the company while Kathy naps,' Drake says, as his eyes appreciatively roam the bountiful motherly curves of your tauric form.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Though his gaze is nowhere near lecherous or libidinous, a part of you can't help but enjoy the attention as you saunter up to the counter and settle yourself beside him as he works. The two of you commiserate over the state of the city, and your shared experience with the local mutants. Though your conversation is neither deep, nor insightful, it still serves as a nice chance to vent your frustrations with a sympathetic soul. Over time, the topics begin to drift to the esoteric side of things like what kind of gas does a dragon pool toy inflate itself with? If a pod person ate an awesome fruit would it be cannibalism, or autophagy? Naturally, you don't take any of it seriously, it just feels good to have the post-apocalyptic equivalent of a water cooler conversation with him while he cleans, calibrates, and resembles his rifle. Though your banter is suddenly broken up though as the gate to The Last Chance begins to rattle.";
	say "     Just as the metal scrapes the black top, both you and Drake, thinking you're about to be under attack arm yourselves then dash outside. Drake is the first one out, his rifle trained on the creature at the gate. A large three-headed sudo-draconic entity clad in tough emerald scales, you recognise as one of the hydra beasts prowling the junkyard shuffles through the aperture, however, unlike its more bestial cousins, the one seems to have no issue walking on its hindlegs, or using its bestial forelimbs to manipulate the latches on the Chance's fortified portcullis. Strangely, its extra heads seem to dangle limply at its sides as if sedated. Despite its grand size and all the difficulty its animalist form may bring, the hydra has little problem in manipulating the gate's lock almost like it knows what it's doing. Perhaps it's not feral, you muse, noting the presence of a fraying bright yellow rope tied around its waist and arms connected to a makeshift rucksack made out of blue plastic tarp slung on its back.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Yet as you're about to give voice to these thoughts, Drake motions for you to stand down saying, 'Don't worry, I know this guy,' then holsters his weapon and turns his attention to the hydra. 'Pyotr you crazy Slavic son of a bitch, what the hell are you doing out here so early!? I thought you weren't coming by for another day or two. Shit man, I didn't get the chance to put out the welcome wagon for ya,' he says jogging up the hydra and offering his hand in greeting. 'Da, is no problem, friend Drake. Was making a delivery to da McDermott boys. Well, their still,' the scalie chuckles through a watered-down eastern-European accent as he shakes the big man's hands. 'It's no good Kvass, but their bathtub gin shuts these two up just fine,' the hydra nods to its placid extra heads. 'Is gooooood, only went blind once this time, the world is still upside down though,' one of his heads mumbles as it sways at his side. 'Ah please ignore this one, it has tolerance of sheltered valley girl trying to disappoint overbearing father figure,' Pyotr says patting the inebriated head like one would a woozy child.";
	say "     'So any who I thought to myself why not kill two birds with one stone, and come visit good friend Drake,' the hydra replies with a jovial sing-song hum. 'Huh, good timing I finished up that shield of yours a little while ago. Do you have those things I asked for?' the big guy asks, casting a conspiratorial glance at room 020. 'Of course friend,' the hydra beams flashing the big man a trio of too-toothy grins. 'I know you are not a man to be crossed, and one who keeps his word too. Both valuable traits in a trade partner, but uh who is your friend there? This one is not known to us,' the hydra asks, tilting its heads in unison to look you over. '[Name of Player]? They're a loner, been doing work with for a while now. Anyway, let me get your stuff,' Drake replies as he ducks back inside then heads to the storeroom tucked in back. While he's gone, you take the opportunity to introduce yourself to the hydra properly.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Ah is nice to meet you, [Name of Player],' the hydra says, bobs his heads. 'I am Pyotr Sidorovich, humble trader, reliable courier, and professional middleman in these trying times. I would say, I'm at your service, but my services are a tad limited right now due to the outbreak. However, if you ever need a fence for rare, valuable trinkets you may find in your travels, my office is in the junkyard not too far from the survivor's warehouse.' Curious as to what he means by valuable trinkets, you ask him to elaborate. 'Oh you know,' he hums in a self-serving trill, 'military ordnance, or stuff touched by the nanites, the whole city is turning into a regular Roadside Picnic.' The hydra chuckles in a deep draconic tone. 'You'd be surprised what you can find out there. Why I've had a man come to me once with the most fantastic sword that oozed corruption and could cut through steel like it was tissue paper. Others have brought me a fruit that gave whoever ate them gills and the ability to resist the bends. Very useful for deep sea salvage if I must say,' Pyotr declares, gesturing to a frilled set of gills hidden under his chin.";
	say "     'Another, sold me obsidian coins he claimed could be used to bargain with the devil himself. Almost bought those, but could not find buyer. Well, other than a jackal lady at the mall, but I no trust her as she reminds me of shifty gypsies.' Curious, you're about to ask him why, when you hear the entrance to the lobby open behind you as Drake steps out. Tucked under his arm, you spy the armored car door he was working on earlier. Immediately, you notice the slab of metal and reinforced glass has undergone a significant modification. As all the internals have been stripped away leaving only an inch or so of what you assume is titanium, lined with sheets of green kevlar that have been studded with black metal rivets. A single view slit has been welded in place at about eye level and has been fitted with what you suspect is bullet-resistant glass. Despite the work done to the improvised shield it is too unwieldy for a normal human, even one as big as Drake. Though as he passes the thing over to Pyotr you realize this is by design as hydra is more than big enough for it. 'So Pyotr we good?' Drake asks while the hydra tests the grip as he shelters his mass behind it.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "      'Very much so my friend and here,' Pyotr pauses to unsling his makeshift rucksack and sets it down in front of Drake. 'All the .50 cal I could find,' the hydra says, tapping the tarp with a long clawed finger. 'Good, and the documents, did Alex get a look at em?' Drake asks, kneeling beside the bundle and undoing the flaps. He pulls out several dinged up ammo crates with the serial numbers filed off. He then cracks open a case, despite the rough state of the clasps the things pops open with a loud clang of catching metal. Peering over his shoulder, you can see the thing is packed to the brim with mags. Rifling through them, he pulls out a magazine at random, slides out several bullets and proceeds to inspect them. While he does the hydra chimes in saying, 'Yes, said everything looks good, just get them to sign, and he'll try his best to get the powers-that-be to accept it. You can find the dossier tucked in the case at the bottom of the bag,' the hydra says, gesturing to the improvised rucksack with its tail. 'No promises it will go through obviously,' Pyotr adds in a salesman-like tone.";
	say "     '*Hrump* expected as much,' Drake replies, idly rapping his fingers against magazine in an aggrivated tattoo. 'Bullets look good though,' he says, slotting the rounds back into the black mag with a audible *click*. 'So, we done here, or you got something else for me?' the big man asks, cinching the bag shut and glancing back at room 020 again. 'Da, may have found a buyer who wants some of those pills and the black stuff you're hoarding. Just waiting for them to come up with some horns or gas. Cause I know you don't take cred, would be easier on my poor back if you did,' Pyotr says ruefully as they massage their shoulder blades where the ropes were digging into them. 'Right, well how about some oxy for the road then?' Drake says, pulling a folded up clear sandwich bag tied off with rubber band from his pocket and offers it to the hydra. 'Ah that would help, my most August of friends,' the hydra, his eyes lighting up like Christmas tree lights chuckles, as they gently pluck the baggie from the human's hand. The unusual scalie then unfolds the thing, slides out a pair of horse pills, and slips them into his other head's mouths. 'That should keep them happy on the way back, regular chatterboxes these two,' the hydra grumbles, patting their extra heads.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Mh tastes like religion,' one of the heads babbles as it loudly chews on its pill. 'Anyways, I be going now, call you over the CB on 26.696 with the usual password if anything comes up. If you hear from any other frequency, ignore it. There's some jokester messing with people. Got the military running around town flapping their arms like chickens with their heads cut off. Oh and before I forget, put those [italic type]party favors[roman type] you wanted in a little tin somewhere in there,' the hydra says, making his way out the gate. 'Got it,' Drake replies, grabbing the huge rucksack and hauling it back to the lobby. As he does, you follow him back inside and ask him what that was all about. 'Just some business, [Name of Player], nothing you need to worry about,' he says as he stashes one crate of ammo away behind the lobby counter. Judging from his tone, as he hurriedly vanishes into the storeroom behind the lobby proper, you doubt you'll get any further information on his business dealings just yet.";
	say "     Shrugging, you decide to head over to the garden and seat yourself upon the wooden platform while you wait for Ava and the kittens['] inevitable return. Thankfully, the cubs and their mother arrive several minutes later pulling simple two-wheeled gigs roped to their impressive flanks. Though built from mix and matched piece of unpainted reclaimed timber and sun bleached rope, the rudimentary cart are nevertheless laden with carrots, potatoes, alongside bundles of unthreshed wheat. Mixed between them are a few plastic jugs filled with what appears to be clean, pure water and a few fire-hardened Red Wood spears. Seemingly oblivious to your presence, your lovely family nearly walks right past you, till you catch sight of Ava's nose beginning to twitch before she glances in your direction, exclaiming, 'Oh hey [Name of Player]!' as she hurriedly unties herself from her cart and bounds over to you in a great flurry of catty floof. Rising to meet her, you swiftly dash to her side, rear onto your hindlegs, and wrap her soft supple body in your paws while nuzzling your cheek against her silky pelt in greeting and relief.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Ah, I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long, [Name of Player],' Ava mews, draping her forepaws about you in a deep bear hug. Shaking your head as you gently sink into her pillowy embrace, you tell her no, though can't say you weren't worried about her or, you pause to motion to your assembled daughters, your kittens. 'Daw, don't worry about us mom, grandpa's been teaching us how to handle ourselves,' one of your angelic children preens, motioning to the main building with a casual flick of her tail. 'Ya and besides, even the behemoths are a little scared of us,' another chuffs, fanning her talons before you. 'She's right I've seen the horsemen hunting parts turn tail the second they see us,' a third crows through a predatory grin. Shrugging, you tell them that regardless, you can't help but worry about them, they are your family after all. Still, you add as you slowly disentangle yourself from Ava, you're glad that they're all safe and sound. 'Oh thanks, but daddy gave us flare guns in case anything happens. Besides, just look at all the stuff we, er... found,' Ava titters, flashing you a disarming blep while theatrically waving her tail towards their carts.";
	say "     Doing your best to act surprised, you coyly ask where they [']found['] them, noting that you haven't seen too many active wheat fields out on the plains. 'Oh, well ya know, we...' your mate stammers only to be cut off by one of your kittens, shouting, '*Tee-hee* that's cause we grew them ourselves, here take a look mom!' as she and her sisters unhook themselves from their carts, then select a few choice items and trot over to you in an orderly line before you. Beaming with pride at your progeny's manners, you make a show of inspecting each item of produce and praising it as the peerless creation they are. All to your kid's delight, as they detail the work they did in finding arable land, securing water, or procuring the mix of ash, swamp water, and heart sap to make their preferred fertilizer. Nodding along, you voice your approval at their skills, and the work of their grandfather in passing on such useful knowledge to your little ones, before offering to share your wisdom with them as well.";

Grinning from ear-to-ear at the sight of your generous offering, your titanic children quickly crowd around your bestial body and tenderly tuck their adorable snoots to your catty dugs as they suckle. Meanwhile, Ava paws up behind you and lovingly wraps her arms about your shoulders, cooing, 'Heavens, I don't think I'll get over how cute they look like this,' as she watches them drink. Rumbling in felicitous feline agreement, you platonically run your paws along their silky ears, delighting all the while at the budding sense of maternal purpose coiling through you as the two of you quietly discuss potential names for your latest litter.";

Arriving to the outskirts, you find the impromptu portcullis largely unlocked. Unlatching the fortified gate, your catty eyes are greeted with the pleasant spectacle of Ava and the cubs cuddled up together in a happy not-so-little circle in the middle of Drake's garden. Though as you quietly shut the gate behind yourself, you can't help but note that your latest litter's pelts are all sporting a magnificent sheen that puts many of the comparatively filthy ferals and post-humans littering post-apocalyptia to shame. Rather pleased by the sight, you call out to them as you rush forward to greet them. At the sound of your voice and the soft patter of your paws echoing throughout the curtain-walled complex, your lovely family's ears perk up in unison as they turn to face you.";

Watching a gap form in the resplendent pile of cuddly kittens, you notice Kathy's tiny figure smugly lounging in Ava's bestial lap. Strangely, despite her seemingly relaxed demeanor as she drapes her cuddly arms over the bountiful hills and valleys of your mate's lush tier of pillowy M-cup breasts, you note how her claws are not only extended, but gleaming a bright cinnabar red as she idly fans them in air. Sensing your gaze settling upon her, the regal lioness levies a delighted smirk in your direction, saying, '[if HP of Augustus Drake is 99]Hey sis[else]Hello dear[end if], we were hoping you'd stop by today, the girls and I were just having a... oh now what did the balding apes call it,' ears twitching in mild aggravation.";

'Oh you know, a chance to freshen up and try on some of this wonderful nail polish and shampoo Draky bought us,' Kathy replies motioning to her own gleaming tawny gold pelt with an exaggerated flourish of her crimson talons. 'I'll admit when my big boy told me how the monkeys slather themselves in herbs, spices, dirt, and rendered animal fat mixed with lye powder and ash, then doused themselves in hot water to get clean, I thought he was out of his mind,' she titters, gazing at the back of her paws as the available light dances across her voluminous pelt. 'Mh, but now that I've seen the results,' she purrs, nuzzling her bewhiskered face along the supply curve of Ava's lush breasts. 'I think I can see the appeal, especially when the girls did such a good job, wouldn't you agree dear?' Kathy swoons, running her hand along the downy soft fur coddling her voluptuous legs.";

'Mh-hm, I can't believe how soft and pretty your fur is now, I bet Drake is gonna love it when he gets back,' Ava mews as her tendrils coil about the plush curves of the feline in her lap, creating the cutest little indentations in her luminescent fur as her exotic limbs caress the voluptuous breeder's body. 'I mean just look how your pelt shimmers in the light,' she says, as her coils rove the inviting expanse of [if HP of Augustus Drake is 99]your catty friend's bountiful body[else]her loving adoptive mother's expectant form[end if], gleefully combing her taut tummy fur against its natural part, exposing the subtle blend of browns, white and gold decorating her pelt.

'It must be nice to have such useful toys,' the portly lioness coos, appreciatively. 'Ah thanks momma Kathy, but you still did a great with me and the kitten's nails,' Ava mews, unsheathing her talons with an excited flourish as she leisurely fans her crimson claws before you. '*Tee-hee* I just love how they sparkle,' she rumbles appreciatively as the ambient light dances off the rich contours of her nails. 'Ya, and just look at ours mommy [Name of Player],' one of your kittens coos as she extends her natural blades with a flick of her wrist, revealing a shimmering set of well-manicured nails lacquered in eye-catching shades of vibrant metallic gold broken with a few tiny patches of onyx randomly scattered along the sleek curve of her claws.";

Are those California Poppies? You question while tilting your head at an inquisitive angle. 'Ya momma Kathy drew them herself, aren't they super cute!' your daughter squeals with catty delight. Really? 'Of course, well,' she shrugs, 'it did take me a few tries since your kittens are so ticklish,' Kathy mews, lightly brushing her supple pads along your kitten's cute not-so-little toe beans. Evoking a playful titter from your angelic daughter as she hurriedly withdraws her paw, chuckling, 'Hey stop that!' 'See,' the motherly lioness chuffs, fixing you with a knowing grin. 'But in all seriousness sweetie, working with your girls was an absolute treat, now go on everyone, show her,' she simpers, gesturing to your lovely little ones with a regal wave of her tail.

Regardless of their stylistic choices though, you nevertheless praise each one for the lovely works of art they are. Glowing under your caring words, your kittens mew appreciatively while Kathy reaches behind herself, and pulls out several clear unmarked vials, saying. 'Of course we saved a couple of bottles for you too dear... unfortunately,' the well-seeded lioness murmurs as she idly traces a toe talon along the walkway. '[if Depravity of Ava is 1]We didn't know what color to get you, so Ava and I bought these clear ones for your nails instead. But,' she hums, with a proud feline trill, 'according to the salesman this stuff is supposed to harden your claws and prevent chipping[else if Depravity of Ava is 2]The girl and I used up all the pretty ones, but we still saved you some of the clear stuff[end if].

Ah, feels good to lay down, you murmur as you stretch out and present your hard-working peets to your adoring children. 'I'll bet, look at your poor pawbies,' Ava simpers, nuzzling her plush, pillowy body next to yours as she caringly takes your dominant forepaw in her hand. 'Oh they're so beat up and tough, you really need to stay off the black top, [Name of Player],' she adds while you playfully roll your eyes. 'But,' she hums, gently flexing your toes while grabbing a bottle of nail polish from Kathy with her tendrils, 'I guess this will have to do for now.'

Pretty kittens like you deserve to be pampered, now isn't that right?' Kathy rumbles, cupping her adorable paws about the tender mass of her lowermost delectable double D's.

'*Tee-hee* oh that tickles,' the plush lioness chuckles as your tactile spines decadently caress her ebony milk spout in their bestial embrace while you enthusiastically suckle, at once bathing your elated palette in a rich trickle of thick fatty cream, while Kathy affectionately rubs her tail along the silky alabaster curves of your fluffy middle. 'Ah that's a good girl, drink as much as you want, I've got plenty to spare,' she murmurs, as your doting kittens and their proud mother expertly massages tender peets and ankles.";

'That's right sweetie, and you're coming along so nicely too, we're all so proud of you.' Ava swoons as her silky forepaws roam your verdant dugs. 'Just look how big and soft you've gotten,' she mews, slipping her tail between the toasty folds of your feral teats as she affectionately dandles the fuzzy tuft of her tail along the silky curves of your oh-so-productive milk tanks.";

Your regal tits thrum with fecund purpose as you ravenously sup her potent cream as your tender orbs groan and slosh delectably while they strain ever-so-slightly in your tentacular embrace. 'Oh such a good mommy, isn't it divine to have all the warm yummy cream you can drink, and your own little pride to care for you, now doesn't it my widdle kitty?' the doting lioness hums while your kittens knead and pamper your pads in their velvety paws. Yes kitty loves her milk, and her babies you mew. 'Of course she does, and just look at how content they are to fawn over you, now isn't that right everyone?' the coy lioness rumbles, gesturing to your precious angels with a soft bob of her head.

'Sh, there-there sweetie, I've got plenty more,' she hums, shuffling her plush body to one side as she lightly presses another puffy nip to your lips. Eagerly latching, your voracious maw is rewarded with a fresh gush of decadent cream that seems to hug the elated contours of taste buds with each needy suckle. Thank you, you rumble in a near drunken cadence as your supple Rubenesque body ripens all the more. 'Daw you're very welcome, just promise me one little thing,' Kathy says with an expectant trill. Anything, you mew in reply. 'That you'll keep making me more wonderful granddaughters with this lovely body of yours, and make sure my sweet Ava is happy, and bred,' she whispers vivaciously.";

All the while, you children chatter amongst themselves as they discuss their coming trip to the city proper and desire to one day follow in your pawsteps. Some opine about finding pets or lovers of their own, while others muse about all the strange and unusual places and things they'll find on their travels. Occasionally though, one or two of your progeny voice the odd note of concerns for their safety, yet such unpleasant thoughts are quieted by the reassuring rumbles from their peers as they remind one another of your presence, or idly boast about the natural superiority of their exotic tauric frames over the lesser creatures polluting the city.";

Given their size in comparison to their tools, you have expected them to see streaks or blotches dotting your talons, yet as you observe your precious angels while you fan your claws, you can't detect a single imperfection in work. Of course, you ruminate, such things are to be expected from your peerless kittens, you muse, before rumbling your appreciation. 'Daw your welcome mom,' one of your daughters mews, flashing you a heartwarming smile.

After all, you note, you have so much wonderful cream to share with them thanks to their generous grandmother, while you invitingly run your tendrils along the growing curves of your milk-laden mounds. Not to mention all the wisdom you can pass on too, you add with a cheerful trill. 'Oh that does sound nice,' a third kitten purrs, hungrily eyeing your expansive rows of your pillowy breasts. Then go on, drink up, you purr, motioning to your plush rows of supple breasts with a light bob of your head. 'Yay,' your cubs mew in unison as they hurriedly nuzzle up your lush mounds, and proceed to drink. 'Aw how cute,' Kathy hums approvingly, lightly running her fingers along the sharp peaks of your ears. 'I know, they always look so peaceful and content like this, don't you think [Name of Player]?' Ava simpers, while she scoots over to her adoptive mother's side. Nodding as you briefly watch your precious angels drink, you then turn your attention to your catty companions and begin discussing what names to give.";

As you let yourself in, your eyes are quickly drawn westward to Drake's Garden and the lovely sight of your latest litter, and their adoring mother lounging on the walkway in pairs. Between them, you spy several coloring books, too-small notepads, loose bits of paper, alongside a wide array of crayons, coloring pencils, and the odd bit of water colors. Despite the obvious difficulty your titanic cubs have holding their chosen implements in the massive paws, they nevertheless seem to be enjoying themselves as they idly sketch, or doodle away under their mother's watchful eye. Hearing the low yet cutting knell of the gate scraping on the ground as you shut it behind you though, your children quickly look up from their task while Brobdingnagian eyes go wide at the sight of you as Ava hollers, 'Oh hey [Name of Player], it's good to see you,' as she frantically waves you over.";
		say "     Mewing a loving greeting in kind, you paw over to them while your cubs hurriedly grab their little works in progress, along with their coloring supplies and make way for you. Walking past them as they purr their own greeting to you, you embrace your loving mate with a deep snuggly bear hug, delighting at her subdued alpine scent coiling about you and the gentle caress of her pelt playing across yours as you sink into her arms while asking her what her and the kittens are up to. 'Not much, they've been practicing drawing,' Ava purrs, nuzzling her boxy chin along your forehead, while she motions to your kittens with a soft bob of her tendrils. Oh is that right, and how are things coming along, you ask as you disentangle yourself from her, and turn to face your brood with a bright catty grin. 'Great, Drake has been buying more art supplies for us, and mommy Ava's has been showing us how to use them,' one of your kitten beams, flashing her birth mother an appreciative smile.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Ya mommy Ava has a really good eye for colors, I just wish these [one of]pencils[or]brushes[or]crayons[at random] were a little bigger though,' another mews, gesturing to a pile of too-small tools arrayed before her paws with a dejected wave of her tendrils. 'Totally, it's kind of hard to hold them, but it's still fun to take a little break from all those books,' a third interjects. 'I dunno, I kind of liked the primers especially since Drake always looks so happy when we do well on our practice tests, he even gives us stickers when we do real good,' she mews, as she bashfully covers up her own little project with her forepaws. '*Hmp* of course you do, cause he always gives you the scratch-and-sniff stickers,' a fourth kitten huffs. 'Well he'd give some to you if you tried harder,' the third kitten peeps sheepishly, idly tracing her left pointer claw along the ground before herself. 'Ya sis, maybe if you spent a bit more time reading the instruction instead of doodling on them you might pass once,' a fifth teases, as she gently boops her sisters on the shoulder with a catty bat of her tendrils.";
		say "     '*Gr*, its not my fault that monkey stuff is so boring, besides Drake says he likes my drawings the best and that yours look like stinky behemoth poo!' the second kitten grumbles, brattishly sticking her tongue out at her peer. 'Hey take that back you mean old [one of]horse-faced[or]buck-toothed[or]two-legged[or]monkey-loving[at random] [one of]Shaftbeast[or]boi[or]Foul Scuttler[or]Messy Pig[at random] kisser!' the fourth kitten roars, baring fangs at her sibling while a line of bristly hairs ripple to attention along her spine as the two of them quickly descend into a puerile diatribe of petulant naming calling. 'Now-now everyone,' Ava simpers in a soft motherly tone as steps between them. 'That's no way to speak to your sister, or,' she pauses, eyes narrowing and tone deepens to a stern razor's edge, 'in front of your mothers,' as she drums her talons along the ground in a warning tattoo. 'Oh... sorry mom,' your cubs murmur as their ears flatten to the sides of their heads. 'Good, now apologize to each other, you're sisters and shouldn't be fighting like this at your age,' your mate huffs. Though a brief look of defiance flitters across their faces, your kittens soon relent and mutter their apologies to one another, half-hearted though they may be.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'That's better, now how about you girls show mommy [Name of Player] your drawings instead of arguing?' Ava hums, as she glances over her shoulder at you as if looking for approval and support. Nodding in agreement, you cheerfully ask your kitten if they wouldn't mind showing you their latest creations. 'Uh, ok, I know it's not the best but I hope you like it mommy [Name of Player],' the third kitten mumbles as she fidgets with a coloring book before passing it over to you with a shamefaced look in her eyes. Taking it, and several other pictures, painting, and doodles from your kitten's, you seat yourself at the heart of the walkway while your cubs crowd around as you make a show of looking over each lovely work of art. You find yourself rumbling contentedly, as you note with no small amount of pride that your daughters are displaying a measure of artist skill. Albeit at varying levels of proficiency as some are colorful, yet simple stick figures of the various bestial creatures wandering the plains. While others are ostentatious caricatures of themselves, their mother, or their caretakers, with a few near life renditions of the wild spaces ringing The Chance thrown in, alongside creatively colored in Bizney Duchesses.";
		say "     Thumbing through them a bit more, you can't help but notice some odd color choices mixed in as various examples of local flora and fauna are bejeweled in all of unusual hues. [if intelligence of Ava is 3]Of course, you remind yourself, recalling Ava's reaction to some of the supplies you liberated from the newsstand some time ago, a number of your cubs most likely take after their birth mother exotic sight, and simply see the world differently. So, it's only natural that their art should reflect it, besides there's a certain charm in their work that could help them stand out should they choose to pursue a career in the arts[else]Then again, despite their unorthodox choice, the exotic mixes are certainly eye-catching in their own right. You muse, observing a few pictures of California Poppies where your kitten colored the normally orange petals as simmering shades of purple and pink instead. Besides, it's nice to see your kittens showing a little creative licence[end if]. You ruminate as you offer your thoughts and mild, well-meaning critiques of their works, though most are surface level, your cubs still hang on every word as if it were gospel while doing their best to explain the meaning of their drawings and stylistic choices. Some of which goes over your head as you eager cubs often find themselves talking over another, yet you wisely nod along, and do your best to project the air of an attentive mother in those moments.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Nearing the end of the pile of half-finished doodles, you find one last piece of that appears to have been signed by Ava herself mixed in, carefully picking it up, you feel lips being drawn into the proud maternal smile at the sight of the little collage of you and your mate [one of]snuggling in each other arms in the middle of sea of golden grass[or]prancing hand-in-hand a through a dry rocky creek[or]basking in Drake's garden[or]sitting beneath the stars on the roof of The Last Chance[at random]. Oh how cute, you purr as you show off Ava's latest creation to your kitten while you admire the interesting assortment of mediums she collected to create these adorable piece. 'Aw, thanks, I made it from some of the girl's throwaways.' your wonderful lover simpers, as she trots up behind you. Really, you ask in a pleasant trill, taking in some of the unique shapes and hues propagating each individual segment of her art. 'Mh-hm, the kittens weren't happy with some of their drawings, but it felt like a waste to throw them out after Da- I mean Drake went through all the trouble of buying these for us,' she purrs, motioning to a little bundle of scape paper amongst the kittens['] art supplies with a light flick of her tail.";
		say "     'Of course,' she preens, fluffing out her expansive chest, 'I saved a few pieces for myself since they might look good on my wall one day uh,' she stammers, tucking her arms behind her back as a guilty note briefly flickers though her otherwise bright tone. 'Assuming I get around it, cause the girls, my chores, and studies have been keeping me busy. Not that I don't love taking care of the kittens, it's just you know...' Ava mews dejectedly through a tired rumble. Nodding, you tell her you understand, peaceful as The Chance is, there are only so many hours in a day, and of course, the kittens come first. 'Ya, I can't wait to show it off to you one day though,' your mate beams, flashing you with a disarming blep. And you can't wait to see it, but first, you bet the girls could use a little [']snack['], you simper, reaching back with your tendrils and give your feral half a gentle shake, delighting internally at the gentle sound sloshing of your cream laden dugs alongside the hungry looks of little ones as gaze at the lush swell of your rows of [breast size desc of player] milk tanks.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Mewing in catty agreement, your cubs vigorously nod their heads while the air resounds with the adorable rumbles of their stomachs as you casually drape your [bodydesc of player] tauric body across the walk, baring your plush teats to them with an inviting wave of your tendrils. Go on now, mommy has plenty to go around, you hum as they paw up beside you, and lovingly tuck their adorable faces to your perky nips while purring their appreciation as they drink. Your evermore maternal mind is flooded with an effervescent rush of motherly contentment as you platonically run your tendrils through their fur, encouraging them to have their fill and imbibe all the wisdom you have to offer. 'Oh such thirsty dears,' Ava simpers, through a dreamy smile as she nestles herself beside you. 'You know,' she hums, running her forepaw down your pillowy flanks, 'I don't think I'll ever get tired of how cute you and the cubs look like this.' Nodding, you lean into her touch, the two of you quietly begin discussing potential baby names together.";

They sun their blushing pelts in the available light while they playfully knead one another's soft milk-flushed middles, or quietly chat amongst themselves, discussing all they've learned and wish to see in the wider world. Out of respect for your cubs though, you only listen half-hearted, still you can't help but feel a note of pride in your breast as their conversations drift between their desire to find and tame pets of their own, proud boasts of all the treasure they hope to discover in their journey, to fancily muses on the strange and fantastical place they want visit. 'Oh sounds like our little adventurers are getting excited for their trip,' Ava coos, nuzzling her cheeks along your shoulders.

Mh so soft, you purr contentedly to yourself, casually tracing your clawing along the exotic colorful borders of her fur as you melt into the supple cocoon of voluptuous breast flesh. '*Tee-hee* naughty girl, not in front of the girls,' Ava teases, given your side a playful pinch. Ok, you titter, letting your hands fall to your sides as gaze out at your lovely cubs lazing about before you.

'Well,' Ava hums through a Cheshire grin, 'if you'd like, you can help me clean up the grounds first?' as her catty eyes drift to the piles of loose paper and art supplies littering the garden. 'Uh, on second thought...' your kitten peeps, flashing you both a cheeky blep while she glances towards the gate.

'*Mrowl* that sounds nice, but first let me put the kids['] stuff away,' she simpers, nodding her head towards their artistic sundries.

Lightly sniffing the air, your catty snout detects the subtle aroma of applewood laced with the vaguest hints of beef drifting upon the breeze from the north west, as you prowl all the closer to the motel proper. You soon catch sight of a thin plume of grey smoke billowing over the walls, any other time you might have been worried by the sight, yet going by the muted gray hues and consistency of the playful wisps wafting upon the breeze, you suspect your children, and their extended family are more than likely cooking something[if loyalty of Kathy is 0], again[end if]. You muse, as a low voracious rumble ripples through your core as the inviting redolence of hickory and bramble fruits soon greets your far-traveled nose. Duly curious and more than a hair peckish after your trek here, you bound over to the gate as quickly as your tauric half can carry you.";
	say "     Nearing the fortified portcullis, you're greeted by the lovely sight of several of your latest litter crowding around several person-sized wood dry racks draped with lengthy glistening medallions of marbled ruby meat suspended over well-controlled bonfires in the heart of the Chance. Seemingly oblivious to your presence, four of your priceless daughters, wearing massive brown leather aprons move from rack-to-rack while they attend the tiny-by-comparisons blazes, or pull glass vials laden with what you assume are herbs and salt from their smock's pocket then drip their contents over the thin gleaming slabs of meat. While to the west and adjacent to Drake's Garden, you spy the big man himself and his portly mate sitting along the walkway with a modest fold out chrome camping table spread out between. Equally engrossed in their task, the happy couple seem to be packaging the freshly jerked beef into an ever growing pile of drab parchment folded into neat squares bound by pencil thin bands of manilla jute fiber.";

	say "     Meanwhile to the east, two of your latest litter toil away at their own gas stoves under the watchful eye of their mother as they stir some large silver stew pots with comically undersized wooden ladles. Though you can't know exactly what they're working on, you can still smell a mouthwatering bouquet of sage, thyme, and rosemary laced with the subtle scents of corn, cauliflower, and zucchini wafting through the air. To the North of them, you notice two more of progeny sitting on the ground near the lobby proper, looking closer though as you quietly open the gate, you notice a set of silvery trays covered in wax nestled upon their catty laps. Though you're too far away to make out exactly what's on them, your nanite-enhanced eyes can still make out a number of newly-skinned green and yellow fruits that you suspect are limes, kiwis, and perhaps lemons that they're in the process of cutting cuboid shapes with their gleaming claws. Arrayed beside is a steadily diminishing pile of some white crystalline powder your daughters use to coat the produce in.";
	say "     Though as you close and latch the gate behind yourself with a loud click that reverates through the parking lot, your expansive family, at last looks up from their tasks. 'Oh look everyone, it's mommy [Name of Player]!' Ava exclaims, as she bounds over to you. 'What really?' one of your kittens attending the drying racks says, as she and her litter mate both rush over to you. 'No way she's here!' another of your cubs manning the stew pots rumbles as she and her sister quickly turn down the burners on their stoves while they watch their birth mother dart past them, then quickly follow suit. 'Holy Molly, it is mommy [Name of Player], come on sis, let's go see her!' a third kitten mews from beside the lobby as her and her kin set aside the trays as they rush forward alongside their eager siblings. Overjoyed by the sight, you extend your arms and tendrils in greeting as you bound forward to embrace your precious kindred.";

	say "     Kathy and Drake look on with proud paternal smiles as you and your family sprint over to one another in the central courtyard, and you rear up on your hindlegs and are swiftly swaddled in the silky hold of your cherished mate and doting young who platonically run their paws through your fur. As they lovingly purr contentedly to themselves, you affectionately greet and kiss each one on the forehead before asking how they are. 'Great,' Ava simpers as her and your brood release their cuddly hold upon you. 'The girls and I were just finishing cooking, and,' she says gesturing to her beaming parents with a theatrical wave of her tendrils. 'Mommy and Daddy were bundling up some treats for you too.' Really, you ask, casting your gaze over to the patriarchal human and his mate. '*Mph*,' he nods, tapping the table with his knuckles. 'The girls brought in a good haul of fresh beef from some of the outlying ranches, so we've been helping them smoke what we can for you and the girls to take with you.'";
	say "     'Though I hope you don't mind we did keep a bit for ourselves and the little ones here,' Kathy hums, idly patting the lush swell of her plush paunch. Shaking your head, you tell her that's fair considering they've generously been housing your cubs for you. 'That's not all mommy, we've been drying some tasty fruits for you too,' a fourth kitten preens, motioning her voluminous tail towards the small, by tauric standards, trays sitting by the lobby. 'Well,' she adds as her ears dip ever-so-slightly, 'those aren't ready yet, but we still have few set aside for you.' 'Ya and we also made a couple of jars of yummy [one of]compost[or]cum poot[or]cream pot[at random] for you too,' a fifth rumbles while Ava quietly chuckles to herself. 'Wa? What did I say?' your bemused kitten queries as a low crimson blush filters through the creamy patches in her. 'I think you mean [']Kompot['] dear,' your mate titters as she reaches out and patts her confused child on the head. 'Right that, eh sorry,' she simpers, flashing you a well-meaning blep.";

'It's a soup grandpa showed us how to make, come on and take a look,' a sixth kitten mews as she takes you by the paw and tries to lead you over. Shrugging you quickly fall in step with her as you paw over to the simmering treats, and as you peer inside, you note the low boil stew is deep crimson with chunks of white cauliflower, shredded beets, and bright green zucchini floating through it. Mixed in with the hearty vegetables, you spy a number of metallic-hued kernels of blue, purple, pink, and emerald glass gem indian corn floating beside them while the herbal scents of their culinary treat wafts about you. Intrigued, you rightly ask if it's ready. 'I think so, say, would you like some?' your daughter beams as her tail twitches ecstatically behind her.";
	say "     Unable to turn down a free hot meal, or say no to your lovely daughter, you nod in the affirmative giving your fuzzy tummy an endearing pat. 'Yay, why don't you go take a seat by Grandma, and I'll go get the dishes!' she mews, delightedly, then proceeded to paw over to Ava's side. Of course dear, you can't wait to try some, you rumble as you sashay over to Kathy and set yourself beside her. Ah feels good to sit down for a bit, you remark, idly flexing your paw's amid a choir of gentle pop from your hard working joints. 'I'll say sweetie, still we're glad you keep making the journey to come see us and the girls.' Kathy says, motioning to your assembled little ones with a wave of her tail. '*Mh*,' Drake adds as he hurriedly packages the last few slabs of jerky then pushes the table aside. 'The girls really look forward to your visits though, got to admit... we're gonna miss having them around,' he sighs, as he leans over and wraps his arm around his cuddly mate. 'I know Draky, it's so lovely having a few extra paws around,' the plush lioness mews, nuzzling her chin along his chiseled arm.";

Once she's finished, your kitten extinguishes the burners and leads her sisters over to your side. 'Here Mommy [Name of Player] get it while it's hot,' she simpers, passing you two vessels the size of a grown man's head while others crowd around you and hand similar helpings to Drake and Kathy. Accepting them with a genuine smile, the happy couple rumble their appreciation and wait for everyone to be seated before digging in. As you eat, your extended family chat amongst themselves about the current goings on in the plains and the status of the kitten's various gardens dotted throughout the grassland. Occasionally, the topics drift towards yours and Drake's experiences in the city, though the big man remains rather tight-lipped about his travels. He nevertheless offers some insight on the fledgling survivor enclaves situated around the mall and junkyard, alongside some advice on how to deal the local traders.";

Your kittens and their mother still hang on every word as you describe the unearthly wonders you've uncovered, and strange fantastical creatures you've met on your travels. Even Ava seems intrigued by some of your toned down stories as her eyes go wide with curious delight as you recount your deeds. Eventually though, as your bowls are emptied your catty chatter begins to die down, your conversations turn to your little ones and what they plan to do in the wider world. To the letter, most express a desire to follow in your paw prints and explore as much as they can, though some hint at their own interest in one day starting families of their own. Others meanwhile, discuss taming some of the more pliable ferals for their [']unique['] designs.";

'*Cough* right, uh Kathy how about we go do the dishes out back while the girls do their thing?' Drake stammers, his slitted eyes narrowing to fine pinpricks as he jumps to his feet and begins hurriedly gathering up everyone's bowl and utensils. 'Daw whats the rush dear, can't we just sit back and enjoy the show?' the fecund shortstack quips, as she eyes up your lovely mounds.

Rumbling in catty amusement, you can't resist smirking at the sight of their eager suckling and the sudden rush of motherly purpose simmering through you as your body is relieved of its rich fare. Despite your familiarity with this simple yet affirming act, a part of you will never tire of the heavenly joy [']weaning['] your kittens brings you, you muse, absentmindedly running your tendrils down the supple curves of your lovely form, reveling in the blissful softness of your pelt and gentle mews of your cubs filtering through you while you and Ava quietly discuss potential names for your precious angels.";

"Rattling tin"	"An old beat-up heart shaped Valentine's candy tin, though much of its once bright red paint has peeled off and it is pitted with thumb size dents that riddle its surface. Opening it though, will take some doing as the lid is horribly deformed and dented inward in places, yet how this thing came into Ava's paws, why she chose to give it to you, and what's inside remains a mystery. Lifting it to your ear though, you can hear a trio of objects rattling around inside, perhaps you should open it and find out."	3	Rattling tin

Extracting one, you carefully unwrap it as your eyes go wide and jaw drops ever-so-slightly as you reveal the gleaming green contours of a trio of M67 Grenades bundled in packing peanuts alongside a piece of plain white paper coiled around one of their equators. Extracting the parchment, you gently straighten it out the hold to the available light, you find the words: [']Felevia was here['] written in bold block letter alongside a simple picture of a smiling fox flashing you the thumbs ups sign emblazoned upon it in dark sharpie ink along the margins. Though you're unsure who this person is, you still pocket the grenades and the note, before tossing the empty tin to the wayside.";

The current F-list mostly includes Preg, F/F, F/M, ovi, lactation, involved TF's, taurs, with a minor smattering of BBW, vore, H/M, and UB content. Further, the quests offer helpful lore, items, and useful equipment that can aid you in your struggles as well as provide some guidance for new or less experienced Player who may be struggling in the early to mid game.";

However, speaking to him without one will reveal bits of his past and the location of other traders. Later on, it's possible to befriend and even obtain a number of unique equipment alongside special events involving his adoptive daughter, Ava. Otherwise, his lover offers the chance to transform him into an angry, if amenable plaything, assuming the player's character has a pussy. Alongside a few special scenes for tauresses of the dominant and vanilla persuasion.";

However, she has a certain soft spot for women, and can even accidentally turn the player into a cuddle tauress if they agree to suckle from her. Later on it is possible for pure blooded Margay taurs to unlock F-preg content by having sex with her three times, speaking with Kathy once, and walking into her room while being a pregnant pureblooded female margay taur. Doing so will start a series of walk-in events where the player can play with her and adoptive mother while they have a bun in the oven. Responding positively to Ava interest in breeding can lead her to developing a breeding kink of her which will consummate in her sending the player out to find a doctor who can help her and the Player knock one another up without becoming males or herms in the process.";

Assuming they've completed Medea's heat control quest in the high rise, though should the player have gained the UB Pred feat and choose the option [']Tell her you haven't adopted.['] a special scene with Medea will be unlocked. Doing so is not required to advance the plot, nor will having the UB Pred feat at any point be mandatory. Once this is completed the good doc will task the player with going to the warehouse district and Trevor Lab's sealed area. At the warehouse, search for an event called industrial canning facility which offers friendly pregnant Players with more than twenty kids a chance to earn a free rucksack should they choose to negotiate with the [']guards[']. Meanwhile at Trevor labs the Player can either visit Doctor Matt to learn the location of hidden sub lab alp sixty nine, or blindly brave the depth and search for the event registry location.";

From here, new sex scenes and walk-ins will be unlocked with Ava that changes based on whether Drake's quest has been completed and he is still human. Though should Ava's lewder content not appeal to the Player, she also offers a little mini quest to raid a newsstand in the high rise for her which can reward them a decent sum of junk food and wads of cash.

Though only female Players will actually have the chane to bed to her, as she has no use for male, herms, or neuters. Drake will not take this well and this will lock the Player out of some of the best endings involving Ava and him.

Dragon Raider Galaxite is started once the player reaches level fifteen by hunting for the event Holy Moly in the sewers. Assuming the Player saves Galaxite from her tentacular fate, she can be found again via an event in the beach called: Beach reunion where she'll offer the Player a chance to join her on heist of a stricken supply ship, but only after you get her some equiptment first. Before the Player sets out there give the option to potentially fuck her, or aggressively tell her they aren't interested in her. Expressing disinterest will censor her description and prevent the player character from lusting after her, this choice is permanent though.

Although characters with strength greater than twenty can bypass the fight, this is not recommended as defeating the guards of that place is a great way to win favor with Galaxite's children. Once dealt with, the Player will be rewarded with several gill fruits and unlock the next event, Break Water Heist found in the beach area. Here, the Player can learn a bit more about Galaxite and potentially Drake if they are a pureblooded Margay taur.

Afterwards, the Player will encounter one final road block in their mighty quest for epic loot that can be resolved with intelligence, charisma, or by letting Galaxite's kids take care of it. Upon completion of this event, the final leg of act one and the current end of her content will open up as Loot Boxes will become active. Discoverable by once more hunting in the beach area, Loot Boxes offers some unique sex scenes for male and intersex Dragontaurs, Margay Taurs, Tiger Taurs, Pather Taurs, and other non equine taurs. In addition, late stage female Margay Taurs and Dragontaurs also have their own special lewds available. Alongside a plethora of gear, items, and a rare chance to become human again, for a price...";

In addition, Players with Strong Psyche or Weak Psyche will have special options opened to them. Much like the main story for Dragon Raider Galaxite, the first event Final Event which is started by walking into the wild Fringes section of the beach. Much like its sister event Ruined Trawler, the Player can either fight or cow the guardians of this place with high strength, yet unlike the other story line its possible to play with the Fruit bats, and later recruit them in act three.

Afterwards, the Player will be presented with two choices, continue serving their patron or spurn them and devolve back into a puny human. Should they continue to serve that last section of act one, Just Rewards will activate and can be started by visiting the rocky cliffs area in the beach zone.
