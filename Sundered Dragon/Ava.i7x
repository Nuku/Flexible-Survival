MainInfection of Ava is "Margay Taur".
Description of Ava is "[Avadesc]".
Conversation of Ava is {"Sex isn't all that important, but it is when you love someone very much."}.

the scent of Ava is "Ava emits a faint calming scent evocative of the moments before a rainstorm."

to say Avadesc:
	say "     Standing a solid twelve feet tall when on all fours, Ava's margay taur body easily dwarfs many of the infected you've encountered up until this point. Her gentle citrine colored feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Much like the margays at the state fair that she likely descends from, Ava's humanoid torso is generously endowed with a sextet of P-cup breasts capped by soft pink nipples, with a huggable fluffy paunch. Her humanoid arms, decorated in adorable rosettes, have a pleasing amount of pudginess to them. Ava's hands meanwhile appear mostly sapien in design, small barely noticeable black pads are visible on her palms. Strangely or perhaps not so strangely instead of finger nails, Ava has tiny partially concealed slits on the tips of her fingers housing her long claws.";
	say "     Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body. To the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of domesticated feline though markedly larger. Her furry paws, comparable in scale to dinner platters, appear built more for stalking prey than out right chases, a reality her thunder thighs heartily second. Her undercarriage mirrors her anthro half having six evenly proportioned M-cup breasts tucked between her legs. Sneaking a quick peek at her supple ass, you notice Ava has a [one of]seemingly bottomless[or]canyon-like[or]cavernous[or]expansive[or]elephantine[or]titanic[or]person-swallowing[at random] cunt. Strangely, her plush pink nether lips though unerringly large have a rather human appearance to them. Tied in a bow around the end of Ava's billowing tail is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's log stamped on the corner.";

Instead of conversing the Ava:
	if HP of Ava is 0:
		say "     Slipping through the partially closed garage door, you find yourself face to face with the garage's feline occupant. Tauric in nature, they would be around twelve feet tall when standing all fours. Their head initially reminds of an average house cats, yet their wide Brobdingnagian eyes and unique facial markings speaks to them more of a nocturnal predator than some lap animal. Adding a measure of credence to this assumption is their luminous pelt, yellow and white with miniature rosettes sprinkled throughout. A feature only present in the designer savannah cat people created some years ago, leopards, ocelots, and... margays! Bingo, you opine mentally patting yourself on the back as you connect the taur's coat with the plump cat girls at the state fair. A hefty creature, the taur's anthro half supports a husky frame with six P-cup fun bags.";
		say "     Fused to their waist is an equally fluffy lower body built in the order of a predatory feline's. Their digitigrade legs have a healthy amount of padding that almost obscures their set of developed calves. Fighting for attention between their legs is another set of six thirteen-inch breasts. Swishing behind them is a billowing tail coated in rings of gold and burnt ebony. Wrapped around the end of this appendage is a small baby blue blanket. She, you realize, is solely female observing her lack of male equipment. Quite the rarity given that most of the tauric Panthera you've encountered tend to be inter-gendered. Then again, she's genus Leopardus after all, but that's neither here nor there.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Her room is sparsely furnished with a faded brown rug, a cobbled together futon, and an old davenport being the sole amenities. The floor, though relatively clean in that there are no bits of dirt or hair laying about, has a good deal of loose paper has been scattered. All of which have random portions expertly cut out. Most of the walls are bare, yet in the rear, you can see what you believe to be the beginnings of a collage made out of old reading material. Or it's her scrapbook collection minus that whole book part. Which would make it more of a scrap wall? You muse as the tauress justifiably interrupts your train of thought.";
		if Player is Male: [Male or Herm]
			say "     'Uh-um, h-h-hello there, does Dad- I mean Drake know you're here?' She stammers with a nervous light in her eyes as she backs her rump against the wall as if to keep her backside as far from you as possible. Wanting to put her at ease, for you doubt you'd get much in the way of conversation from her otherwise. You inform the tauress that Drake asked you to stop by. 'That's a relief,' she sighs, looking a little calmer, yet she keeps her hind end away from you. 'Oh, my name is Ava,' she adds awkwardly, eyeing you as one would a dangerous animal.";
		else: [Female or Neuter]
			say "     'Oh hi there, sorry I didn't hear you walking by, or I would have tidied up a bit. Please just give me a second to clean up.' The tauress says in a demure embarrassed tone as she hurriedly sweeps the loose leaf paper into a pile with her tail. Explaining to her it's alright, you inform the tauress that Drake asked you to say hello, not inspect her living arrangements. 'Right sorry, I didn't mean to say you were, not that you couldn't if you wanted to. Or that you should, I mean,' she shakes her head sighing. 'My name is Ava, nice to meet you,' she says in a much more even tone. In reply, you give Ava your name telling her likewise, which puts a cute catty smile on her face.";
		now HP of Ava is 1;
	else if HP of Ava is 1:
		say "     Having never encountered a Margay Taur before, you ask Ava how she acquired her current form. 'Huh,' Ava tilts her head, 'I've been like this,' she says looking at you like you've just asked her if fire was hot, water were wet, and the sky were blue. Flabbergasted, you inquired when that was. 'I am not sure, let me think,' Ava props her left hand under her chin. 'Actually, now that you mention it I don't know when I was born.' Your curiosity peaked. You decide to ask Ava if she perhaps remembers where she was born. 'Mmhh,' Ava nods, 'it was this weird place called the State Fair.' Feeling like you're getting somewhere, you inquire as to why she left. Reasoning that as far as you know, most margay infected don't leave the fairgrounds. 'Oh, I was looking for my mommy and daddy.' Ava replies as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Finding this an odd response, you point out since she's part margay, wouldn't one of them be her mother. 'Maybe except other margays don't like me, I tried talking with them, really I tried my hardest, but they would hiss and growl at me saying I was [']too big['] or [']not right[']. The other creatures were just as bad, always chasing me, stealing my food, or trying to shove their gross cocks in my face,' Ava says, audibly gags and looking a little green in the gills.";
		say "     '*Cough* sorry about that,' Ava covers her mouth, 'I got really queasy. So I left, I thought maybe I could find my daddy out in the city. Maybe he and I could look for mommy at the fair. I never found him though,' she says, tucking her chin into her bosom and sighing. You ask why she came to The Chance then if she was looking for her family. 'This,' Ava flashes a blanket with The Chances name tied around her tail. 'I've had it since I was a kitten. I don't know who gave it to me though, but it's all I've had to go on,' she says, crossing her arms as if she were cold. Wondering what happened next, you ask her how her search went. 'Bad,' she peeps, 'most of the people I meet either ran away or tried hurting me. Sometimes I could get them to go away if I gave them my food and water but... not always.' You ask her if she ever fought back. 'Once, but it didn't feel good.' Cocking your brow, you ask if she could be a bit clearer. Ava shrugs, 'I can't really explain it but I get this tightness right here when I think about seeing people in pain, kind of like I can't breathe,' she says placing a paw on her chest.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Though a part of you wants to mention that sounds like a conscience, you decide not to derail her again and let her continue. 'It still hasn't gone away, and I'd rather be beaten up again than feel that way.' Not sure how to respond to such an admission, you inquire about what happened next. 'I don't know. I remember my head started getting really light and hot like I was always standing in the sun all the time then... I-I think I got chased out of the city or maybe I left on my own. My memory is kind of fuzzy but I know at some point I ended up in the plains. It wasn't that bad since the... ferals? I think that's what Drake calls them, out here didn't bother me but they didn't talk to me either. So, I, um sort of wandered around until I got lost after this stinky rain washed out my trail. But not long after that,' Ava brightens up, 'I found a, what did Drake call it, a billboard I think, with the same marking as the one on my blanket.' You ask if that's how she found her way here.";
		say "     'Mh-hm, there was a road I followed leading right up to The Chance. I couldn't read it at the time though but I recognized the L.C. mark,' Ava answers, pointing to her bow. Remembering the less than warm reception Augustus gave you. You ask Ava how her first encounter with Drake went. 'To be honest, the way he first looked at me even though he was nude and unarmed. It was probably one of the most frightening experiences I've had. There was just something about his expression that said I was less than a bug to him, but then, I saw Kathy standing him clutching her tummy as she hid behind Drakes['] leg. I realized what they were, a mommy and a daddy. For a second I thought they were mine, wait that's not true.' She mews mournfully. 'I wanted them to be mine but... they aren't.' Ava whimpers. Wondering how things went from there, you inquire if Ava was able to learn anything about her family. 'No, Drake donates the linens here every few years to the Red 't', so it can given it to other people. Or something I don't really understand it myself.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Nodding your head, you ask Ava why then she is still at the Last Chance. 'I don't know where else to go. Besides, I like being here with Kathy and Drake. They're always so nice to me. Drake even gave me this room. That was the first time anyone ever gave me anything,' Ava adds, patting a nearby wall with her tail. What about her parents? Doesn't she want to find them, you ask. 'A little bit, but I am not so sure anymore,' Ava says, furling her ears. 'I mean if my parents actually cared about me why was I abandoned? But Drake and Kathy, they listen to me. They really care what I think, and how I feel. My [']real['] parents couldn't even be bothered to name me, Da-Drake did. He said it was the name of a beautiful woman who taught a great man how to sing the blues.' Interesting you muse then turning your attention to Ava's work in progress, you inquire next as to what she's doing with it. 'That it's called a-a-um coil edge, no coal age, or is it a college? Oh wait it's a collage I am making of mommy and Drake. See there's Drake's left eye,' Ava points to a number of overlapping brown-ish photos depicting an African savannah. 'And that's part of mom's tail,' Ava gestures at ads for gold Rolex watches. Sadly, you don't [']see['] either of these things, no matter which way you look at it.";
		say "     To you it just looks like a bunch of photos randomly adhered to a wall. Perhaps reading your expression, Ava chimes in. 'I am not anywhere near done though. You see, since I already cut up most of the spare books and magazines around here,' she says motioning to the piles of sliced up literature. 'I'm, well, running out of art supplies. I mean I get lucky from time to time and see something I missed. But still I haven't gotten anywhere in quite awhile.' Ava says, propping her chin on her wrists. 'Maybe if I,' Ava shakes her head as if to clear it, 'no that's a bad idea.' Maybe what's a bad idea? You inquire. 'Oh, I was thinking about [bold type]hunting [roman type]around the [bold type]high rise district [roman type]for this big green box that had all these colorful pieces of paper on display. I think Drake said it's called a [bold type]newsstand[roman type]?' Ava shrugs. 'I'm pretty sure I could use that, but I don't want to leave the Last Chance. I'm sure something's living in it though.' Ava sighs as she wistfully stares at her project, 'Oh well I am not going to worry about it.'";

Not in the mood to take this kind of a load point blank, you put your paws up as he slowly steps between you and Ava. Drake continues, 'I don't want to shoot you, not in front of little Ava. So what happened here, why do you have her face, why did you hurt her?' Drake prods. Before you can respond, Ava, still recovering from her shock, squeaks through her split lips.";

In that instant, you can almost see his mind at work as a cold internal calculus weighs his affection for his [']daughter['], the risk she poses to not just his humanity, but his unborn children. You can see the gun in his hand shaking, the barrel turning toward Ava just a hair before it falls. 'Is that true, Ava, she did this to you,' he gestures with a shake of his revolver. You nod giving Drake an abridged version of events that Ava more or less corroborates. 'Damn kid, I am at a loss for words. I want to say I am sorry but,' he looks at his daughter's injured face.

Should I go to the forest downtown and pick some Awesomer fruits or grab some sticky sushi from the collage? Would that make you feel better?' Drake proffers, though you can tell from his tone he's losing patience with you. Sighing, you tell Drake that won't be necessary, you're an adult you'll figure out your body situation on your own. 'Right then do you mind giving me some space, so I can take care of Ava. I am sure you can see yourself out right?' You nod not wanting to push things further, there's no point in starting a fight after all.

You offer with a catty grin blossoming on your face as you trace a finger down the side of Ava's engorged bosom, remembering fondly the sweet flavor of her cream. 'Mh,' Ava rumbles like a hunting cat as she guides you over to her bed, 'that does sound nice and I could always use a good milking. I've gotten so full and heavy. I'm starting to get sore again,' Ava purrs, giving her heaving bosoms a shake for emphasis.

You tease, tweaking one Ava's colossal teats between your fingers, absolutely in love with how stiff and perky her nips are. 'Then why don't you have a taste? I have plenty to share,' Ava replies, squeezing her bosom against your cheeks, filling your senses with the scent of fresh linens and sierra winds.

Yes, you mumble between suckles of cheek-filling portions of milk, you need to be bigger, so much bigger. 'Then drink up, but you better not waste so much a drop of that milk, or I will be very angry with you, understand?' Ava warns her voice takes on a harder more dominant tone as she wipes off an errant dribble of cream from your lips. Yes Ava, you swoon, switching to a fresh teat, happily awaiting the cycle of blissful expansion to wrack your tauric body.

'Aw that feels kind of nice,' Ava mews. Oh if she likes that, well you can make it feel even better, you purr, gently lapping at her massive inverse human-like button with a long, exaggerated, sloppy lick, though you're careful to keep the spines of your feline tongue mostly flat as you do so. You don't want to cause her any discomfort, but adding a bit of flair to your performance never hurts, you muse, probing her plush clitty hood with your oral invader.

Not wanting to impede her, you spread your legs for your larger lover and languidly fan your tail as if to welcome her advances. You can hear Ava purr in a deep approving trill that washes over you in waves of pleasant vibrations as she remarks through a low catty rumble, 'Aw, you look so cute like this. It just makes me want to eat you up even more,' as she kisses your comparatively petite pussy.";

Meanwhile, the not-so-little cunning linguist's delectably large tongue teases your feline flower and tender button with broad sweeps of her pleasantly barbed oral muscle. Ava lavishes your feline sex in a heady constantly shifting squall of decadent dichotomous delights.

What a good girl, you purr, feeling the tips of her claws dance across your pelt as she tweaks your perfectly perky nips between her thumb and pointer fingers.

Ava collapses beside you, a happy dopy look is plastered on her face as she pets your lower body affectionately while cleaning any excess fluids for your pelt. For a time, no words pass between you. You're both more than content to simply cuddle in your shared many-limbed embrace and caress each other's silken pelts as you wallow in the afterglow of your affair.

Folding them up, you walk over to the counter, you lightly rap your knuckles on the metal surface of the counter. At the sound, the creature begins to stir, as a single bloodshot eye pops open. It fixes on as its pupils shrink to murderous pin-pricks as its warped mind tries to parse your existence as it leaps to its feet. 'Wa, who, what do you, what do you want, mutant!?' it shrieks, baring its teeth at you, spittle dripping from its lips as it looks you over. Unfazed, you tell the creature in your most banal tone that you'd like to buy some travel magazines, a couple of nature ones, and if they have an art rag throw those in, oh, and a few chocolate bars.";

With each convulsion, you can see the seams fray and patch begin to rip as the wolverine struggles against its nanite-borne impulse to guard this place no matter the cost. Ya, don't think they're coming back anytime soon, can they ring you up? You have cash. You ask in a droll tone, flashing a fist full of dollars. The creature blinks, a look of confusion written on its bestial visage as the fragment of its human personality wars with its nanite influence. It almost looks pained as it stares at your money, for a moment as the rusty hamster wheel in its head turns a degree.

'Th-thank you Mx please be aware we are a-a-a,' the thing shudders as the veins on its neck bulge and throb like the creature we're caught in the throats of acute tachycardia. 'Paper bags only, Cali-California has banned plastic bags and,' The wolverine bleats, grasping hold of the counter as more violent tremors rack the mutant's body as they struggle to hold itself together. 'That will be $35.73 please know the bag tax is ten cents in this city. Also d-d-due to the pandemic, you will not be able to return these items.' Whatever, you tell them, keeping your expression vacant and placid as you place the exact amount on the counter.";

Still, the addled person somehow manages to collect your money despite the tremors rocking its hulking form as it pockets your payment.

After all, what's the chance they actually are sane, probably near zero. Even if they are, there is a good chance they might try slipping you an infectious item or double cross you. Best play it safe, you tell yourself selecting a building whose rooftop would give you the best angle of fire.

You can't think of any others that could reach several stories off the ground and bend steel like pipe cleaners. If there were something like that, you're not sure you'd want to meet more kaiju-sized infected anytime soon, you think to yourself, scanning the skies warily.

You then think about angling your shot, but haven't really had the chance to figure out the rate drop of your weapon is at this distance. It would also put the magazines at risk, you realize not wanting to ruin them with blood splatter or potentially frenzying the wolverine. While they may not be the most dangerous infected out there, they are not total pushovers either, it could make a lot of noise if it went looking for you and who knows what manner of attention that could bring. No, you need to do this in one shot, without risking the loot.

Thankfully, it's not loud enough to be heard that far, but to the creature it must be quite annoying as you can hear it snarl as it pokes its black furred head out from under cover. That's it, you muse breathing out and squeezing the trigger. With a *Pop* and *Thud* your round hits  square in the temple, slamming the wolverine's head to the pavement with the force of impact. Though you can already see it's starting to recover before you even holster your weapon. Not that you're surprised, it's almost impossible for some of the infected to die, all you've done is give this one a concussion and the mother of all headaches.

A couple minutes later and you've enriched yourself with a fat wad of US dollars, a few fist fulls of euros, and a pile of colorful foreign currencies that are worth more as decorations and conversation pieces than as actual money.

'You did! I can't believe it,' Ava stammers, her eyes go wide with delight as she sizes up the covers on the nature magazines. 'You actually found these, but I uh...' Ava mews mournfully, her ears drooping as she shifts her weight between her paws nervously and sets the magazine down on her davenport. 'I can't accept these.' Wondering why, you ask her how come. 'I don't have anything to give in exchange. Daddy says it's not fair to ask people for help, and not repay them for it.' Shrugging, you inform her you were never expecting to be reimbursed, that you did this out of the goodness of your heart. Besides, you found plenty of supplies there you wouldn't have known about without her tip.";

Tittering, you explain its money from other countries and that you thought she might like a few. 'But they're so pretty, aren't they worth a lot, are you sure I can just have them?' Ava asks, eyeballing the large denominations emblazoned on them. Eh, not here, most of these are worth a nickel, maybe less, economics are funny like that. You tell her, handing Ava a small stack of brightly-hued bills. 'Really,' Ava contends holding up a Caribbean note. 'They're so colorful though, I mean look at the blues on this one.

When I did, he started acting a little weird and he said had to clean something up really-really badly, then ran off,' Ava peeps, stifling a sniffle.

His hands are much bigger and the sweet smell reminds me of mommy, but the shape is wrong.' She says, motioning to the doorway. 'When I look in the corners, I can see a sheen of olive oil colored stuff pooling where somebody did their business once.' She remarks, though a mild shudder passes along the ridge of her feral spine. 'When I look at sunlight or moonlight I see these motes of vibrant purple and waves of metallic blue auroras that look like the picture of seafoam Drake showed me once.'";

You interrupt, not wanting to hear any critiques of your post-apocalyptic hygiene. 'Ok,' Ava nods. 'Thank you for this though, these will really help with my project.'

Ava doesn't disappoint either, she kisses and suckles your inverse clit with loving precision as her nose buries itself in the plush tissue of your lush pelt.

As her lush ebon cunt takes up more of your vision, you're thankful she at least takes it a bit slow, letting you sneak tiny breaths out the edges of your muzzle.

Your mind is torn between Ava's oral affection and Kathy's face smothering snatch. A part of you wants to buck and howl with lust like the beastess you resemble, but the living muzzle of Kathy's sugary leonine pussy turns your frustrations into adorable little gurgles only you can hear. As your air escapes between the gaps of Kathy's thighs and under belly fur, stimulating her sensitive areas. 'Ha-ha, that tickles,' you vaguely hear Kathy pant as your pendulous feline tongue kisses the lips of her fuzzy mound. Your own massive maw is swaddled in Kathy's molten muff like an exotic gag.";

You muse on this while riding out the waves of hormone-addled pleasure as Ava laps at your feral clit as if it were her own personal lollipop and beads of Kathy's fem cum drips down your furry chin. You know you wouldn't trade bodies with any man or herm. Pregnant sex is just too good, your nerves are just so wild and raw when you have all these wonderful hormones in your bloodstream. Even the slightest breeze can set you off. Judging from the level of heat and dew radiating from Kathy's slopping cunt, you know she feels the same. You can only imagine what she's experiencing grinding her small body that's so overstuffed with kittens and milk against your exotic fertile form.";

As yours and Kathy's litters paw at one another through your fluffy tummies and Ava's loving cunnilingus battle for your recognition, your warped-psyche is torn between pleasures all the while driving you closer to the edge. You can even hear Kathy pant with exertion and lust as her body nears in limit as well. 'So good,' Kathy cries as her thrusts become slower and lazier as her pampered body struggles to keep up with her animalistic needs, till she can barely lift her ponderous frame. Instinctively, your paws move up her plush middle and sink into her generous love handles as lend your own strength to her efforts.

This blissful choir of sensations roils inside your elated being till at last you feel her well-trained cunt almost pinch down on your muzzle as she cums hot rivulets of feminine juice down your feline face. As she howls with release, you feel her slouch in your grasp as the spent kitty collapses face first into the welcoming embrace of your lower body. Her short fall is thankful cushioned by your collective pudge acting as a natural mattress. Utterly sated, the purring tiny lioness snuggles her portly frame atop you, kissing and kneading your fur as your own climax approaches.

To her credit, she doesn't protest in the slightest, if anything the horny kitten sounds quite pleased with her sticky treat. She even goes so far as to lick you sopping feline nethers half clean. What a good daughter you've raised, you quip to Kathy as the pair of you lie back together, letting Kathy rest herself on your bed-sized lower belly for comfort. 'Why thank you sweetie, I'd like to think being a mom suits us both,' Kathy replies, nuzzling your [bodytype of player] tauric body. 'Oh, Ava when you're done back there, can you clean mommy too?'

Once she's done, Ava pokes her head up from under your belly licking her lips saying, 'Ok I'm done, Mom are you, oh,' as she sees Kathy passed out form sprawling over you. Ava blinks then shrugs saying, 'And she's napping, again, great I wanted to... oh nevermind,' while scooping Kathy off of you and holds her close to her bosom like a child. 'I'll go take mommy to Drake. I'd bring her upstairs myself, but I kind of,' Ava pauses to guiltily twiddle her thumbs, 'almost broke the walkway last time I tried. Eh, be right back.' She nods to the Last Chance before popping out the courtyard. In the distance, you can hear her and Drake talk in the background, but you can't make out what they're saying.

You smile back at the pair, waddling toward them, sighing with contentment as your paws grace the cushiony mattresses. Oh, you really needed this, you remark, flopping down on your elongated back. A part of you is more than a little glad not just for the chance to get off your paws for a moment, but also at the opportunity to lay on a real mattress again, rather than some stinky cot that's probably ninety percent asbestos and ten percent compacted dust at this point.

'See, that is how kitties['] paws are supposed to look, clean, fluffy, and with a nice tuft of fuzz in the middle.' She continues, in a chastising yet motherly tone that makes you feel a bit self conscious. 'Oh, sorry,' Kathy furls her saucer-like ears, 'that came out all wrong dear. I sometimes get a bit of, oh what does Drake call it,' she bobs her head thoughtfully, 'mommy brain?' Kathy says, perhaps picking up on your mood. Confused, you raise a questioning eyebrow to her and parrot the odd phrase. 'Oh you know, the urge to mother people and praise my wonderful, perfect little Ava here.' Kathy gushes.

You absentmindedly run your dominate forepaw over the artful swell of your bestial tum. Still though, a nagging cynical segment of your mind pontificates, should you really be encouraging this?

However, your exotic body still gets a tad worn down from all the extra weight, giving you back aches at times. On top of that, you are always growing a few cup sizes with each litter.

Sighing, you try explaining the estrus cycle, the differences between the human and animal versions to her as well as how the nanites have overcharged it to aid in their propagation.

I think I just felt one of their tiny pawbies push against my palm. Could you feel that too?' A little bit, you admit, it does feel kind of nice actually. It's almost like someone hugging you from the inside and out, you reply, gliding your feline digits over the lightly churning mass of your furry womb marveling at how big you're getting.

As your digits brush along the firm layer of amniotic fluid sheltering your kittens, you at last feel one of their tiny paws grabbing your cute toe beans, causing your heart to flutter. Did you see that Ava? You gush like a girl on prom night as a rush of nanite laced hormones floods your body with a tide of warmth and effervescent feelings toward your growing brood. 'No what happened?' Ava answers, pausing her exploration of feral bump to glance at your wiggling anthro belly. Gesturing to your navel, you tell her one of your kittens just grabbed your finger.

It won't be long till it fully pops out into an even bigger and cuter outie you muse, playfully pinching a thick roll of furry pudge between paws before giving it a gentle shake whispering encouragement to your rumbling tummy. For a moment, nothing happens and the room is quiet, save for the low gurgle of your cub-stuffed womb and sensuous sloshing of your milk-filled tits. But perhaps responding to their mother's loving stimulation, your little ones perk up with a sudden flurry of activity.

Ava coos, gesturing to the tiny paw prints created by your quickening brood dotting your glowing pelt. Of course, you tell her. You've got plenty of padding for them, you add with a proud joking tone while giving your hips a hearty slap. 'Oh you're just the best!' Ava replies, running her sizable digits over the taut rim of your navel. Your little ones react to her touch almost at once. Their little paws all seem to gather around Ava's fuzzy feline fingers.

Drake said he ran into people studying nanites, could one of them do something? Mommy also says the nanites made people and animals into mutants along with all sorts of other weird stuff. Who's to say they can't do this?' Ava queries.

At the sound of the aperture closing behind you, Medea's yellow-brown head frills appear to perk up slightly as if to better angle her ear holes as she sets down the containers. She turns on the balls of her padded reptilian paws, revealing the unsubtle swell of her scaled tum poking out from the hem of blouse. 'Ah well if it isn't my favorite patient, what can I do for you today?' Medea smirks, casually and shamelessly eyeing up your middle as you walk in, as if inspecting her handiwork. Returning her greeting, you tell her nothing for you, thanks, but a lover of yours had a question for her. Nodding, Medea motions for you to continue.

A few items are easily recognizable like stethoscopes, sterile syringes, industrial scales, and, blessedly, a manual blood pressure gauge. The rest appear to be custom-made tools that resemble forceps, spanners, and spreaders of varying quality. Naturally curious about the good doc's work, you begin to ask them about it, but Medea cuts you off as she runs a scaled along the growing curve of your baby bump exclaiming. 'Oh my, you've been taking quite good care of yourself dear!' as her sleek paws gently prod the underside of your engorged furry womb. You nod, leaning into the cute lizard girl's touch, enjoying both the attention, and the pleasingly cool caress of her scales along the taut surface of your pelt. 'What an astounding process, it must feel amazing, and your current form seems to have taken to it quite well too,' Medea rumbles approvingly, running claws through your spotted silken pelt.";

She swoons, tracing her talons along the borders of your puffy naval, sending sensual tremors through your flush core as her claws lightly graze your sensitive flesh. 'Though you may be getting just hair on the plump side,' she snickers, giving you lush love-handles teasing pinch. 'But a bit of weight gain is to be expected, and you wear it quite well. Besides, I'll bet your little one needs all the nutrients they can get, and they seem to be growing rather rapidly too,' Medea notes, palming the equator of your gravid tum. 'In fact,' she coos, edging her sleek reptilian mitts along your [bodydesc of player] flanks, 'I'd like to take a few measurements, purely for, er, research purposes.'";

'Perfect!' she cries in a too eager tone as she grabs a bright yellow tape measure from her pile of supplies. She saunters up beside you and attempts to take your measurements. Though the tapeline barely makes it halfway around you, forcing Medea gets creative as she adheres several together with a bit of masking tape. 'My my, *huff* aren't you the big girl?' The overeager lizard coos with a flustered look on her muzzle and eggy core rubs against your spotted pelt, as she struggles to wrap her arms around you. Her slender form sinks into the [bodydesc of player] mass of your gravid figure as she pressed herself against you. The enthralling aroma of reptilian arousal teases your senses as her smooth egg-swollen middle rifles against your latest kitten. What can you say, must have been someone you ate. You tease, flashing the good doc a far-too-toothy smile, while you lightly paw at her tight curvaceous figure.";
				say "     'Uh sorry I didn't mean to...' Medea gulps, over the loud rumble of your stomach as she realizes how close she is to your drooling maw. You smell the fear and desire welling up inside her as your claws lightly graze her cool sleek vulnerable scalie hips, yet you push back against these budding instincts through sheer force of will, telling her no harm done. You're quite enamored with your present form, and you can't say you aren't a little curious either as to how big you are at the moment. '*Tsk* Unfortunately that's inconclusive,' Medea replies in a tactful tone, pulling herself away, 'your baby is growing, or, regrowing rather rapidly. Your belly already measures in at over over sixty nine cm, and climbing.' Nice, can't wait to see how big they get. Guess it won't be long till you make a proper tauress out of them yet. You coo, lovingly stroking your taut stomach fur. 'Indeed,' she purrs, enviously running her taloned fingers along the supple swell of her growing bump, 'say, do you mind if we try weighing the little one instead?'";

She zeros it and motions for you to plop you bump on the scale. More than a little excited to find just how heavy you've gotten, you grab hold of your portly mound, reveling in the weight of the thick layer of adipose and dense core of amniotic fluid swaddling your adopted child as they rest comfortably in your lush paw pads. With a low grunt, you gently heft the growing mass of your turgid tum just above the analog scale then gingerly lower your bundle of joy onto the scale, listening with no small amount of pride at the sound of the metal gears grinding under the weight of your little one. Oh that takes a load off the backs, you joke, waiting for the device to settle. All the while Medea's gaze darts between your burgeoning bump and the numbers as the machine struggles under your girth.";

She drones on for several minutes before jotting something down, saying. '.0003 grams seems to be the average.' Cocking an eyebrow, you ask what she means. 'Well weighing you little one is proving rather... difficult,' Medea says gingerly patting your fur, 'your upper belly alone appears to be gaining .0003 grams per minute, quite the growth spurt. Fascinating as the data may be though, this doesn't account for your lower half, or the initial weight of your adopted child.' She adds gesturing to bountiful curves of your animalistic half. 'Perhaps in the future we can find a few [']volunteers['] to weigh properly, assuming you aren't opposed to it.' She swoons, flashing you a lewd knowing smirk. 'Regardless, I must say the speed at which your body's able to reform others is remarkable even by infected standards!' She exclaims, as her tail snakes its way along the lower half, cheekily fondling the supple animalist curves of [bodydesc of player] form.";

'Really, so it's not just a feature of your current tauric form,' Medea says, scribbling something on her pad, 'then do you mind if I take a blood sample? I'd like to check what manner of hormones your body is producing, and see if I can find nucleotide or nano-mechanical marks left by your little one, then we'll discuss your friend's needs.' Shrugging, you tell her why not. 'Thank you, let me just get the supplies.' She says, sauntering over the back of her office, Medea roots through a series of draws pulling sterile and still in their package syringes, a felt pen, a handful of lab-grade vials, and a wad of cotton. She quickly scribbles your name plus the date on them and motions for you to place your arm on the counter beside her. Complying with her request, you do as she instructs.";
				say "     'Alright just look away for a second,' nodding as you tilt your head to one side. You feel a cold pressure on your arm as Medea disinfects the area followed by a tiny painless pinch. 'Done, you can look now.' Medea says pressing a wad of gauze to your arm. Impressed by her skill, you tell her you hardly even noticed. 'Well, I've had a lot of practice on needle-phobic people. Now, you were telling me one of your partners had a question for me?' Right, you tell her that her name is Ava and that she was the one wondering if it were possible for two biological women to have a child. Considering her prior success in giving you the ability to unbirth others, you were hopeful she could somehow co-opt or adapt the process. 'Hm, well it is possible, I know of some foreign fertility clinics that were attempting a similar feat, and there are some rumbling in S.F. about groups looking to achieve the same results. I'd imagine it would be quite expensive, and I doubt they'll show results for the next twenty odd years.'"; [Author's note: Funny enough for the low price of 1 million USD same gendered partners can now have kids in S.F., was not expecting that when I first wrote this in 2012.]

				say "     Medea lets out an exasperated sigh. 'Right now, the easiest option would be some estosterogen pills, they're non-transformative and should allow you both to grow male genitals without compromising your female anatomy. I heard some were being tested in the city hospital before the cataclysm as part of some bluesky HRT project. I am sure you could find some there, or you could just bite the bullet and find a donor male or herm.' Shaking your head, you inform the good doc, Ava is a bit Agoraphobic and borderline misandrist at times, so that option is out of the question. 'Then I'm not too sure what I can do for her,' Medea replies, shrugging her shoulders. Oh come on doc, she's a dang fertility genius, she's made cunt pills, ovi pills, mpreg pills, learned how to give people control when they get pregnant, and even figured out unbirthing. This should be nothing for her! 'Well, ok maybe I do have an idea how to help,' Medea says, her scales blushing a light rosy red, 'but I need some samples from some of the more exotic infected, and better equipment.";
				say "     Mind you, these creatures are highly infectious and a lot of the equipment I need is at Trevor labs. Supposedly, the place was locked pretty tight before the outbreak, so I don't imagine you could just waltz into that place without a keycard, or staff member to show you around.' Not a problem, you tell her, you've been there before and have some knowledge of the layout. 'Ah then let me just get a list together of what I need,' Medea replies, swishing her tail towards a nearby brown metal file cabinet tucked in the corner of her office. For the next few minutes, the good doctor digs through various poorly organized drawers and overstuffed folders. Eventually, she seems to come across what she's looking for, 'Here we go,' she says, plucking out a number of manila file. She quickly skims them and jots a list of items on her notepad.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     When she's done, Medea rips out the page and hands it over for inspection. Looking it over it appears she wants: a sample of Saber Kitty Cum, Corota Venom, Wyvern Goop, a collection of Awesomer fruits, fresh fish from a very specific industrial canning facility in the warehouse district, estosterogen pills, Fertile Pills, and some equipment whose name has more umlauts than a page in the average German phonebook. Once you finish reading it over, you ask if there might be an alternative, her request is a little... robust. It could take you days if not weeks to gather everything, by then the military could roll in. 'There might be, but you're really not going to like it.' Medea replies nervously, drumming her clawed fingers along the back of her notepad. Huffing, you tell her you'll be the judge of that.";
				say "     'Right,' she begins with a pained pregnant pause, 'you see there is an odd species of black wasp reminiscent of Braconidae in the high rise district. They allegedly have the unique ability to implant some sort of mutagenic parasite in the womb, or the uterine analog of their victims that slowly turn them into wasps, or mind broken broodmares. If you were able to bring me one for study, I wouldn't need the other items.' Understandably curious by what precisely she means by [']bring['] her one would entail as well as what she wants to do with it, you ask her to elaborate. 'Ok,' she winces, taking a deep breath as if to center herself, 'no beating around the bush, you'll need to let one infest you, then bring it here in utero. Where I'll administer a cocktail of dilators, painkillers, muscle relaxants, various anthelmintics, and sedatives to induce a sudo-labor and extract it, alive.'

She reverently palms one of her engorged teats while her free paw roams her voluptuous form, eagerly groping the tight curves of lightly-muscled body, creating cute indentations in her plush scaly flesh as her clawed finger down her legs invitingly. Of course dear, you purr over the audible rumble of your tauric stomach at the sight of the perceived feast laid bare before you.

Reaching down, you delicately run your non-dominant hand along the glassy-smooth surface of her core in a soothing circuit, cooing, there-there, does that feel better?

I had some concerns, the raw rush of foreign nanites might have proved too much for your body to handle, it's good to see that theory was proven wrong,' Medea chirps, as she jots down your response.

You tell her it can be, but you've gotten used to it at this point, and have your means of coping with any unwanted changes. 'You must have quite the flexible psyche then, most people can't handle a single transformation. I had hoped your body might adapt on its own, hm,' she pauses to jot something down, 'I'll have to make some adjustments in the future, perhaps a concentrated burst of microwaves could be used to nullify any invasive strain before the builder nanites reach critical saturation levels.

Looking it over, it appears Medea wants: a sample of Saber Kitty Cum, Corota Venom, Wyvern Goop, a collection of Awesomer fruits, fresh fish from a very specific industrial canning facility in the warehouse district, estosterogen pills, fertile pills and some equipment whose name has more umlauts than a page from the average German phone book.";
		say "     Once you finish reading it over, you ask if there might be an alternative, her request is a little robust. It could take you days if not weeks to gather everything, and by then the military could roll in. 'There might be, but you're really not going to like it,' Medea replies nervously. You tell her that you'll be the judge of that. Right,' she begins with a pained pregnant pause, 'you see there is an odd species of black wasp reminiscent of Braconidae in the high rise district. They allegedly have the unique ability to implant some sort of mutagenic parasite in the womb, or the uterine analog of their victims that slowly turn them into wasps, or mind broken broodmares. If you were able to bring me one for study, I wouldn't need the other items.' Understandably curious by what precisely she means by [']bring['] her one would entail as well as what she wants to do with it, you ask her to elaborate. 'Ok,' she winces, taking a deep breath as if to center herself, 'no beating around the bush, you'll need to let one infest you, then bring it here in utero. Where I'll administer a cocktail of dilators, painkillers, muscle relaxants, various anthelmintics, and sedatives to induce a sudo-labor and extract it, alive.'

His faceguard awash with a soft blue light of his monitor as he tabs through pages of spreadsheets and background programs. Recalling the list that Medea gave you, and reasoning that since Matt is the last sane member of the research staff left, as far as you are aware at least, he might have some knowledge of where to find these items or at the bare minimum, point you in the right direction. With no other leads, you clear your throat to get his attention. Lost in his work though he doesn't respond, forcing you to rap your knuckles roughly on the glass. Shocked by the sudden noise, Matt leaps to his feet in a panic, knocking over his office chair. He grabs a nearby red staple gun and points it around the room frantically like it were a handgun as he swivels his head in blind fright looking for the source of sound with a terrified expression seared into his face. When your eyes meet, you throw up your arms in mock surrender, jokingly telling him to not shoot.";
	say "     At the sound of your familiar voice, Matt's expression softens as he loses a light chuckle. His gaze drifts from the stapler to the reinforced glass wall protecting him from the horrors of the outside world. The man appears to calm down a bit, and asks what you're doing here, stating that he's in the middle of some important tests that demand his full attention. Wanting to respect his work, even if you don't fully understand what it is, you then give him a brief censored version of events. Explaining how you're assisting another doctor studying various aspects of mutant reproduction and need some supplies from the lab. Nodding along, Matt, likely intrigued, asks to see the list in question. Flashing him the thumbs up sign, you press the list to the glass, and notice the light of recognition in his eyes as he reads off the items. 'Hm, under normal circumstances, I'd have to turn down such a request. However, considering all you've done to support the cause, I may know where these are, but,' he pauses to click his teeth, 'you'll need a keycard to enter that section of the labs.'";

	say "     'Give me a moment, I think there's a visitor's pass somewhere in here.' He says, motioning to the poorly organized clutter littering his campsite. He kneels down beside a pallet of sealed office snacks, his hazard suit squeaks loudly as if somewhere rubbing to over inflated balloons together as shift through the pile of supples. 'Ah, this should work.,' Dr. Matt remarks, as he pulls out a bright yellow keycard from under a pile of half eaten instant noodles that like their home to a budding colony of scoby cakes. 'The items you're looking for are in Isolation Lab Alp-69 sub-level 1, Access Point Primus. I would strongly recommend bringing a strong rucksack or a dolly with you if you truly intend to ransack the lab.' Why is that, you ask. 'Well the,' Matt pauses as he takes in long deep breath, 'Schäfer-Nägele-Göring-Köhne-Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff-Jorgen-Von-Strangle-Jager-Bombastic-Rothschild-Habsburg-Vandercunt-autonomous-exo-lab you're associate is seeking is powered by an advanced Stirling radioisotope generator.'";
	say "     Normally, we employ a forklift to move it, but,' he shrugs as he looks over your tauric figure, 'I'm sure your current form will manage it, somehow,' the doctor replies, as he plucks a lightly used napkin from his suit pocket and scribbles something that looks like directions on the back with a nearby pen. 'You'll need these too,' he says dryly, tucking both the card and napkin between his pointer and middle finger, then flashes his chicken scratch in your direction  'After the outbreak, a number of highly sensitive experiments were left... unattended far too long.' What sort of experiments, you query, naturally curious about what manner of hazards you may encounter. 'The need-to-know kind,' Matt grunts, causing the budding crows feet ringing his eyes to twitch ever-so-slightly in aggravation, though whether or not this sentiment is directed at you, or something else you can't say. 'All you need to know is that when containment failed, much of the lower level was damaged, and several passages collapsed in the resulting chaos,' he says, in a lighter tone, motioning towards a tab on his workstation labeled: Deadman's Hand Protocol.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Going by the last ping sent from the building's automated custodian, I doubt you'd be able to find your way in without them.' Dr. Matt adds, as he flicks open the two way airlock separating the two of you and places the note along with the keycard inside. With a quick practiced motion, he quickly punches in some manner of code, or command, you can't be certain from your current angle into the pad beside the airlock before sealing it, then waits patiently as the device cycles. Seconds later, a light on your side flashes green as the aperture hisses and opens, loosing a low pungent fumes of sterilizing chemicals. While he watches you pocketing both items, Matt loudly clears his throat to get your attention. '*Ahem* [name of Player], do be careful down there.' You tell him not to worry about it. You're a big girl and you can handle whatever is down there. 'I should hope so [Name of Player], you've been a,' Matt pauses, parsing his lips as if searching for the right word, 'passable assistant throughout the outbreak, your loss would be a shame,' then turns back to this work without sparing you another moment's notice.";

You pour through countless defiled labs and ruined passageways dotting the underground catacombs. The air grows more humid and oppressive, the scents of mold and decay war with one another for primacy as you trek deeper into the abyss. Many of the paths you cross show signs of mutant aggression as the innumerable scuff marks dotting the floor all tell the sad tale you've seen far too often on the surface. You muse, observing the trail the heel prints and nail scratches, and claw marks scattered about the floor where some luckless soul was dragged off into the gloom. Gradually, these signs of resistance fade as pieces of what may have once been a bright orange cleansuit litter the ground like luminescent bread crumbs as whoever this once was seemed to have succumbed to their infection, you note, as you spy the unsubtle change in the scrawling blemishes belighting the ground grow closer in shape till at last they become indistinguishable from one another.";

Here and there lucid scintillating slime leaks from what may have once been a gleaming white roof, in a prattling tattoo, now though, the tiles are tinted necrotic black by a writhing ebon mold, streaked with pulsing crimson veins spreading across its surface. The labs fare little as most appear to have been host to some manner of stampede, or wild mass exodus of their previous occupants as ruined priceless equipment and rare chemicals litter the floor like common trash on the surface. Others though are far less fortunate, as the building plumbing and waste water pipes have ruptured like benighted cysts spilling countless gallons of foul-smelling liquid into them, ruining anything of value they may have contained. More than once, you come across a lab with its HVAC seals still intact and flooded to the rafters as if it were some mockery of a bottle garden.";

Alongside it, you spot the wriggling bright yellow forms of plasmodial colonies glomming onto the walls, and partially translucent Cnidaria tendrils shaped like a prismatic helix spotted with glowing red nodules reminiscent of the boiling plasma found on the rims of accretion disks spirals aimlessly through the murk. Observing the blobs movement, you can almost feel the hate and... envy, radiating off from the distressed primeval eyes of the fetal mass as they longingly stare at your [bodydesc of player] [bodyname of Player] body.";

They must have been one of the staff here, or perchance, one the former staff descendants that got caught in there when the pipes failed, its current appearance, likely an unfortunate result of nanite's attempt to keep it alive in whatever manner of carcinogenic slurry it now finds itself in. A part of you doubts if the creatures could even leave their fetid cradle at this point, at least in their current state. Who knows how much of their minds are still intact, or if it would even be possible to change them, you remake internally, watching a light fog form around your palm print. You observe the fetal creature swimming next to it, its crude misshapen limbs flailing akin to some emaciated palsy victim, as it tries to place its crooked hand beside yours, though you use the term in the loosest possible sense. The tainted appendages graying flesh is spotted with chem burns both old, and new, its digits twisted as if they were suffering from Dupuytren's contracture as its rubbery calloused fingers struggle to stay unclenched.";

Its weeping gums are riddle with sickly yellow phosphorescent cysts, and a thin bone spur-riddled tongue nestled along the rotten appendage. Stretching its maw at an impossible wide angle, the thing lunges at the aluminum crystal barrier with unnatural speed, its impact sends a resound quake through the floor beneath as its fangs shatter on the artificial sapphire. Caught off guard by the explosion of violence as the creature batters its unearthly maw against the wall, heedless of the damage it does to itself, you stumble back and slip on an errant puddle of some nameless viscous ooze. You're sent tumbling back, and collide with a door leading to a darkened adjacent lab. The aperture holds for but a moment, then gives with frightful metallic knell as you fall into the all-encompassing gloom with a loud thud.";
	say "     Stumbling to your feet, dust, or at least what you dearly hope is dust, billows around you in an oppressive cloud. Your senses are greeted by the sweet pungent tang of ozone mixed with organic decay like some great inferno had raged through here. As if to confirm these suspicions, you note the presence of a melted lab bench tucked in the corner of the otherwise vacant room and the huddled charred remains of a cleansuit curled in a ball beneath it. The former occupant was likely in the throes of nanite conversion as you note the former human's carbonized form is draped in boiled blackened plastic akin to a shroud, twisted far beyond the acceptable norms of baseline humanity. Their legs are bent at alien insectoid angles that end in long scything claws. Their jaws are split down the middle and lined with saw-like fangs akin to some abyssal fish while tendrils longer than the victim was tall sprout from their back and tailbone. Its hands though, are still human, and in them is clutched an intact, if somewhat singed metal storage clipboard.";

Looking at the picture, you see a middle-aged, if somewhat overweight, latino man with almond eyes, rosy dimpled cheeks, a kind weather beaten face, and glossy, oiled, slicked back hair dressed in a tuxedo.

You then turn your attention to the binder, leafing through the pages. You realize that its an inter-lab shipping manifest belonging to someone called, worker class code 5192 R. Mendoza, in it you find a number of the items you were looking for have been moved to the hazardous testing and isolation lab Alp-69 along section, access point Primus.

A part of you hopes that this is due to good fortune, but your inner cynic wonders if the mutants might be avoiding this section deliberately. If true, you'd rather not find out what's keeping them away. Regardless, you remain unmolested all the way to Alp-69. Once you arrive, you're unsurprised to find the thing is locked down by a massive tungsten blast door. Thankfully, you spot a red LED light flashing nearby attached to a black plastic card-reader recessed into the wall. Experimentally swiping your keycard, you watch the LED switch from red to yellow.

Once it's clear, you note that the lab's entrance is divided into two sections, one is a clear glass-like substance framed by black metal barrier larger than most heavy industrial forklifts. Peering at the edges, you spy a number of generic warning labels in different languages dotting its edges all warning staff to keep clear when the safety shield is being lowered. Given the size and presence of motorized grooves, which aren't all that different to ones you've seen used to shutter stores. You surmise this section is able to be raised and lowered, possibly to bring in, or remove large equipment.

Lacking any features or interface, you briefly wonder how you're supposed to open the thing when it suddenly starts to hiss as the aperture creaks open spewing whatever was inside directly in your face. At once your nose is assaulted with the overpowering stench of chlorine, bromine, and other counter septics singe your lungs as the different atmospheres of lab and corridor attempt to equalize. For the moment, you have no choice but to retreat as you fall back coughing and spitting phlegm as the air around you clears.";

By the time the lab has properly vented, and the air stops stinging your senses, you've cleared your lungs of much of the irritants though you still feel like you just washed your lungs out with jet fuel. You take a moment to compose yourself, then check your surroundings once again. You worry something must have heard that, it would be impossible not to, yet you find your solitude is undisturbed. Still, you're wary of further surprises as you slink back to the Alp-69. You can still smell the [']purification agent['] as the building's P.A called it, but it's no worse than an over-chlorinated indoor pool now. Hopefully it hasn't damaged the equipment, but there's no way to know until you check.

Mentally gritting your teeth for what will no doubt be a monotonous search, you whip out the good doc's list and search the room in a clockwise pattern starting at the shelves closest to the door. Cracking the first one open, you're pleasantly surprised to find that none of the items appear damaged by the spray, too bad you have no idea what these things are though, or how they're organized. Oh well, good thing you have a list, so you don't have to drag everything out of here. A bit of digging and sorting later, and you've collected most of the goods.
