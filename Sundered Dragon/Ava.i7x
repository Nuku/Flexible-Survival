MainInfection of Ava is "Margay Taur".
Description of Ava is "[Avadesc]".
Conversation of Ava is {"Sex isn't all that important, but it is when you love someone very much."}.

the scent of Ava is "Ava emits a faint calming scent evocative of the moments before a rainstorm."

to say Avadesc:
	say "     Standing a solid twelve feet tall when on all fours, Ava's margay taur body easily dwarfs many of the infected you've encountered up until this point. Her gentle citrine colored feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Much like the margays at the state fair that she likely descends from, Ava's humanoid torso is generously endowed with a sextet of P-cup breasts capped by soft pink nipples, with a huggable fluffy paunch. Her humanoid arms, decorated in adorable rosettes, have a pleasing amount of pudginess to them. Ava's hands meanwhile appear mostly sapien in design, small barely noticeable black pads are visible on her palms. Strangely or perhaps not so strangely instead of finger nails, Ava has tiny partially concealed slits on the tips of her fingers housing her long claws.";
	say "     Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body. To the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of domesticated feline though markedly larger. Her furry paws, comparable in scale to dinner platters, appear built more for stalking prey than out right chases, a reality her thunder thighs heartily second. Her undercarriage mirrors her anthro half having six evenly proportioned M-cup breasts tucked between her legs. Sneaking a quick peek at her supple ass, you notice Ava has a [one of]seemingly bottomless[or]canyon-like[or]cavernous[or]expansive[or]elephantine[or]titanic[or]person-swallowing[at random] cunt. Strangely, her plush pink nether lips though unerringly large have a rather human appearance to them. Tied in a bow around the end of Ava's billowing tail is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's log stamped on the corner.";

Instead of conversing the Ava:
	if HP of Ava is 0:
		say "     Slipping through the partially closed garage door, you find yourself face to face with the garage's feline occupant. Tauric in nature, they would be around twelve feet tall when standing all fours. Their head initially reminds of an average house cats, yet their wide Brobdingnagian eyes and unique facial markings speaks to them more of a nocturnal predator than some lap animal. Adding a measure of credence to this assumption is their luminous pelt, yellow and white with miniature rosettes sprinkled throughout. A feature only present in the designer savannah cat people created some years ago, leopards, ocelots, and... margays! Bingo, you opine mentally patting yourself on the back as you connect the taur's coat with the plump cat girls at the state fair. A hefty creature, the taur's anthro half supports a husky frame with six P-cup fun bags.";
		say "     Fused to their waist is an equally fluffy lower body built in the order of a predatory feline's. Their digitigrade legs have a healthy amount of padding that almost obscures their set of developed calves. Fighting for attention between their legs is another set of six thirteen-inch breasts. Swishing behind them is a billowing tail coated in rings of gold and burnt ebony. Wrapped around the end of this appendage is a small baby blue blanket. She, you realize, is solely female observing her lack of male equipment. Quite the rarity given that most of the tauric Panthera you've encountered tend to be inter-gendered. Then again, she's genus Leopardus after all, but that's neither here nor there.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Her room is sparsely furnished with a faded brown rug, a cobbled together futon, and an old davenport being the sole amenities. The floor, though relatively clean in that there are no bits of dirt or hair laying about, has a good deal of loose paper has been scattered. All of which have random portions expertly cut out. Most of the walls are bare, yet in the rear, you can see what you believe to be the beginnings of a collage made out of old reading material. Or it's her scrapbook collection minus that whole book part. Which would make it more of a scrap wall? You muse as the tauress justifiably interrupts your train of thought.";
		if Player is Male: [Male or Herm]
			say "     'Uh-um, h-h-hello there, does Dad- I mean Drake know you're here?' She stammers with a nervous light in her eyes as she backs her rump against the wall as if to keep her backside as far from you as possible. Wanting to put her at ease, for you doubt you'd get much in the way of conversation from her otherwise. You inform the tauress that Drake asked you to stop by. 'That's a relief,' she sighs, looking a little calmer, yet she keeps her hind end away from you. 'Oh, my name is Ava,' she adds awkwardly, eyeing you as one would a dangerous animal.";
		else: [Female or Neuter]
			say "     'Oh hi there, sorry I didn't hear you walking by, or I would have tidied up a bit. Please just give me a second to clean up.' The tauress says in a demure embarrassed tone as she hurriedly sweeps the loose leaf paper into a pile with her tail. Explaining to her it's alright, you inform the tauress that Drake asked you to say hello, not inspect her living arrangements. 'Right sorry, I didn't mean to say you were, not that you couldn't if you wanted to. Or that you should, I mean,' she shakes her head sighing. 'My name is Ava, nice to meet you,' she says in a much more even tone. In reply, you give Ava your name telling her likewise, which puts a cute catty smile on her face.";
		now HP of Ava is 1;
	else if HP of Ava is 1:
		say "     Having never encountered a Margay Taur before, you ask Ava how she acquired her current form. 'Huh,' Ava tilts her head, 'I've been like this,' she says looking at you like you've just asked her if fire was hot, water were wet, and the sky were blue. Flabbergasted, you inquired when that was. 'I am not sure, let me think,' Ava props her left hand under her chin. 'Actually, now that you mention it I don't know when I was born.' Your curiosity peaked. You decide to ask Ava if she perhaps remembers where she was born. 'Mmhh,' Ava nods, 'it was this weird place called the State Fair.' Feeling like you're getting somewhere, you inquire as to why she left. Reasoning that as far as you know, most margay infected don't leave the fairgrounds. 'Oh, I was looking for my mommy and daddy.' Ava replies as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Finding this an odd response, you point out since she's part margay, wouldn't one of them be her mother. 'Maybe except other margays don't like me, I tried talking with them, really I tried my hardest, but they would hiss and growl at me saying I was [']too big['] or [']not right[']. The other creatures were just as bad, always chasing me, stealing my food, or trying to shove their gross cocks in my face,' Ava says, audibly gags and looking a little green in the gills.";
		say "     '*Cough* sorry about that,' Ava covers her mouth, 'I got really queasy. So I left, I thought maybe I could find my daddy out in the city. Maybe he and I could look for mommy at the fair. I never found him though,' she says, tucking her chin into her bosom and sighing. You ask why she came to The Chance then if she was looking for her family. 'This,' Ava flashes a blanket with The Chances name tied around her tail. 'I've had it since I was a kitten. I don't know who gave it to me though, but it's all I've had to go on,' she says, crossing her arms as if she were cold. Wondering what happened next, you ask her how her search went. 'Bad,' she peeps, 'most of the people I meet either ran away or tried hurting me. Sometimes I could get them to go away if I gave them my food and water but... not always.' You ask her if she ever fought back. 'Once, but it didn't feel good.' Cocking your brow, you ask if she could be a bit clearer. Ava shrugs, 'I can't really explain it but I get this tightness right here when I think about seeing people in pain, kind of like I can't breathe,' she says placing a paw on her chest.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Though a part of you wants to mention that sounds like a conscience, you decide not to derail her again and let her continue. 'It still hasn't gone away, and I'd rather be beaten up again than feel that way.' Not sure how to respond to such an admission, you inquire about what happened next. 'I don't know. I remember my head started getting really light and hot like I was always standing in the sun all the time then... I-I think I got chased out of the city or maybe I left on my own. My memory is kind of fuzzy but I know at some point I ended up in the plains. It wasn't that bad since the... ferals? I think that's what Drake calls them, out here didn't bother me but they didn't talk to me either. So, I, um sort of wandered around until I got lost after this stinky rain washed out my trail. But not long after that,' Ava brightens up, 'I found a, what did Drake call it, a billboard I think, with the same marking as the one on my blanket.' You ask if that's how she found her way here.";
		say "     'Mh-hm, there was a road I followed leading right up to The Chance. I couldn't read it at the time though but I recognized the L.C. mark,' Ava answers, pointing to her bow. Remembering the less than warm reception Augustus gave you. You ask Ava how her first encounter with Drake went. 'To be honest, the way he first looked at me even though he was nude and unarmed. It was probably one of the most frightening experiences I've had. There was just something about his expression that said I was less than a bug to him, but then, I saw Kathy standing him clutching her tummy as she hid behind Drakes['] leg. I realized what they were, a mommy and a daddy. For a second I thought they were mine, wait that's not true.' She mews mournfully. 'I wanted them to be mine but... they aren't.' Ava whimpers. Wondering how things went from there, you inquire if Ava was able to learn anything about her family. 'No, Drake donates the linens here every few years to the Red 't', so it can given it to other people. Or something I don't really understand it myself.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Nodding your head, you ask Ava why then she is still at the Last Chance. 'I don't know where else to go. Besides, I like being here with Kathy and Drake. They're always so nice to me. Drake even gave me this room. That was the first time anyone ever gave me anything,' Ava adds, patting a nearby wall with her tail. What about her parents? Doesn't she want to find them, you ask. 'A little bit, but I am not so sure anymore,' Ava says, furling her ears. 'I mean if my parents actually cared about me why was I abandoned? But Drake and Kathy, they listen to me. They really care what I think, and how I feel. My [']real['] parents couldn't even be bothered to name me, Da-Drake did. He said it was the name of a beautiful woman who taught a great man how to sing the blues.' Interesting you muse then turning your attention to Ava's work in progress, you inquire next as to what she's doing with it. 'That it's called a-a-um coil edge, no coal age, or is it a college? Oh wait it's a collage I am making of mommy and Drake. See there's Drake's left eye,' Ava points to a number of overlapping brown-ish photos depicting an African savannah. 'And that's part of mom's tail,' Ava gestures at ads for gold Rolex watches. Sadly, you don't [']see['] either of these things, no matter which way you look at it.";
		say "     To you it just looks like a bunch of photos randomly adhered to a wall. Perhaps reading your expression, Ava chimes in. 'I am not anywhere near done though. You see, since I already cut up most of the spare books and magazines around here,' she says motioning to the piles of sliced up literature. 'I'm, well, running out of art supplies. I mean I get lucky from time to time and see something I missed. But still I haven't gotten anywhere in quite awhile.' Ava says, propping her chin on her wrists. 'Maybe if I,' Ava shakes her head as if to clear it, 'no that's a bad idea.' Maybe what's a bad idea? You inquire. 'Oh, I was thinking about [bold type]hunting [roman type]around the [bold type]high rise district [roman type]for this big green box that had all these colorful pieces of paper on display. I think Drake said it's called a [bold type]newsstand[roman type]?' Ava shrugs. 'I'm pretty sure I could use that, but I don't want to leave the Last Chance. I'm sure something's living in it though.' Ava sighs as she wistfully stares at her project, 'Oh well I am not going to worry about it.'";

Curious, you inquire as much. 'Well, [Name of Player], I've been thinking a bit and, you love me, right?' Ava asks as she nervously traces circles on the floor with her foreclaws. Smiling reassuringly, you tell Ava you wouldn't keep coming to see her if you didn't care about her. 'Then, um, will you,' Ava stammers dropping to one knee, 'please bear my children!' She cries, taking your paw in hers. She draws it to her face as a pleading look crawling across her feline visage. Doing your best to stifle a laugh, you politely ask Ava the hard and pertinent questions, how and why. 'Well I've been watching you and mommy, the two of you seem so happy and.

You purr, arching your back for effect. Perhaps she just wants to know what it's like getting railed with all the wonderful hormones rushing through her?. Ava nods. Well, if that's the case, you can always find her a nice stud. You might even have some pets who could help out. '[bold type]NO[roman type], I don't want someone else's kids, I want yours!

Otherwise there's not much that you can do unless... 'Unless what?' Ava asks hopefully. Not too sure how to best explain your relationship with Medea, you tell Ava that you know someone who may be able to help. You just need to speak with her first.

Messing with something as volatile as the nanites is bound to have some manner of consequences neither of you can predict. 'Ok I think I understand, but you promise to go see them right away right?' Ava says rather excitedly, placing her paws over her portly stomach. Grinning, you nod to Ava setting your own paw reassuring on top of her fat furry tum, reveling in the feeling of your pad sinking into her soft pliable adipose. You tell her you will get right on it as you run your claws down her side. A part of you can only imagine how cute she'll look if Medea is able to come through.

Drake said he ran into people studying nanites, could one of them do something? Mommy also says the nanites made people and animals into mutants along with all sorts of other weird stuff. Who's to say they can't do this?' Ava queries. A part wants to challenge her on that, but Cock Cannons, tentacle monsters, Shaft Beasts, literal demons from freaking hell, and sentient latex pool toys exist so trying to argue or speculate on the limits of what the nanite can do is a Sisyphean task. Still, not wanting to break her spirit, you give her a politician's promise to ask around but are very upfront with the fact that no one may be able to help.

Grinning, you tell her to lie down and let you show her. 'Tee-hee. Well I do like surprises,' Ava teases, shimmying over to her makeshift futon. She lays down and rolls onto her back, giving you a wonderful full view of her bountiful body in full repose. And what a sight it is, you muse, gazing at her body's tauric splendor. Her rows of large shapely breasts resting comfortably against her soft form. Her cute furry forepaws tucked submissively against her like a pet begging for attention while her hindlegs cradle her perky dugs. Your eyes wander down her gold, white, and black spotted pelt, drawn to her juicy feral flower. You watch as the big cat fans her heated muff with her billowing tail, filling the room with the scent of eager tauress. Her sweet needy aroma coils about you like a green-eyed snake, invigorating your desires with her exotic feminine fragrance.";
	say "     Not that you needed any further prodding, you had already made up your mind to devour her world, but a little pageantry never hurt anyone you think to yourself, as you position your body along the length of her sizable lower half. You drape your arm over her rearmost furry dug, gingerly massaging her milk-stuffed teats as you saddle your face adjacent to her lush furry sex. 'Heh, that feels nice, but please go a little easy on me. I don't think Mommy has milked those in a while. So, um, maybe you could help me, pretty please,' Ava simpers in a playful tenor as she strokes her padded forepaw over the back of your head. Well, since she asked so nicely, how can you say no, you muse, taking hold of one of her massive milky melons and guiding her stiff nip to your lips. You languidly brush your fingers along the sides her animalistic sweater puppies in a little show of appreciation before wrapping your mouth about her swollen milk spout, your maw watering with anticipation as you recall her sweet flavor.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Her eager milky melons are quick to react to your touch as tiny beads of rich margay taur milk dance across your taste buds. Your body demands more though and you have no desire to contest it as you start suckling, drinking in thick mouthfuls of her opalescent ambrosia. With each swallow, you can feel your own latent margay taur nanites whirring to life with the reintroduction of Ava's own. The process is slow but enjoyable as your body seems to swell with their presence. Your form shifts, reinforcing its tauric shape, and purging any foreign strains from your core outwards. A section of your nanite-touched mind marvels at the sensation of your breasts growing heavy and tender as raw virgin nerves blossom into existence while your chest swells with productive tissue. Some part of you can't help but feel quite pleased with the immediate results, your warped mind takes no small bit of pleasure in your growing bust.";
	say "     If anything, you wouldn't mind seeing how far you can push yourself, you muse, running a paw over the hefty orbs, feeling the way your skin creaks and sloshes with the cream contained within. You'd make a great wet nurse or dairy cat with a rack like these, you opine as the respective tissue spills through the cracks in your fingers. Soon though, these same blissfully changes spread to your lower half as body shifts closer to facsimile of Ava's own tauric form. By the time you've drained the last drop of nanite-laced lactate from Ava's rearmost bosom, your body has fully scourged the presence of any lesser strains, reinforcing your margay taur nature. While adding on a few delightful inches of feminine flesh in the process, you note hugging your doughy animalistic assets, you have to admit that you quite like these alterations. Your tainted mind's only regret is that they stopped.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Considering what you've seen in the city after all, mere [Breast Size desc of Player] tits and a [cunt size desc of Player] muff seems rather puny nowadays. Especially on a body as large as yours, you opine. And from the low rumble Ava gives you as her paws knead your voluptuous body, you can tell she feels much the same way. 'Wow, I guess my milk still agrees with you,' Ava remarks, patting your doughy sides affectionately with her forepaws. Purring happily as her pads massage your burgeoning body, you tell her it seems that way. Besides, it's not like you're not enjoying it. What's the point of holding back anymore with all that's going on? You can be as big as you want without any consequence, so why not indulge your curiosity? Your tauric body certainly can handle it after all. 'Ah, I'm glad you feel that way. I kind of like the new you. Your body just feels so soft and squishy like one of those cute toy sea cucumbers I saw at the state fair.' Ava titters, giving your lower half a playful squeeze with her sizable paws.";
	say "     Glowing at her praise, you tell her that you're rather inclined to agree with her. Having a big soft mate to play with is quite the treat, you note, nuzzling your muzzle along the underside of Ava's doughy undercarriage while your paw kneads her pillowy racks. 'Aw that feels kind of nice,' Ava mews. Oh if she likes that, well you can make it feel even better, you purr, gently lapping at her massive inverse human-like button with a long, exaggerated, sloppy lick, though you're careful to keep the spines of your feline tongue mostly flat as you do so. You don't want to cause her any discomfort, but adding a bit of flair to your performance never hurts, you muse, probing her plush clitty hood with your oral invader. Ava squirms at your touch, her body practically trembling with excitement as you explore her dewy cavernous folds with quick flicks of your tongue, though with each tender passionate pass, your own neglected sex increasingly cries out of attention.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Feeling desire bubbling within you, you signal your need with a little waggle of your tauric hips and an eager mewl. The sight of your jiggling feral flanks and lurid vocalization snaps her to attention as she arches her larger anthro frame into position. Though you're unable to see her do so, you can still sense her warm breath playing across your moist petals as her large boxy muzzle brushes the fur of your hindlegs as she tries to wedge her far larger head between them to better attend your sex. Not wanting to impede her, you spread your legs for your larger lover and languidly fan your tail as if to welcome her advances. You can hear Ava purr in a deep approving trill that washes over you in waves of pleasant vibrations as she remarks through a low catty rumble, 'Aw, you look so cute like this. It just makes me want to eat you up even more,' as she kisses your comparatively petite pussy.";
	say "     You coo, delightedly as her lips encompass your feral feline flower. Her sizable tongue strokes your vulva with bestial passion as she services your drooling muff. You mewl in animalistic joy at the way her soft pseudo-barbs tease your sordid sex. You almost feel like you can sense each fleshy spine lavishing your welcoming passage as Ava's oral member attends to your needy tauric depths with her loving touch. With each pass, the pair of you fall deeper into beautiful rhythm, wordlessly syncing your passionate exchange. Every kiss and exalted lap of your sexes complements the last as your paws roam each other's soft plush bodies. Whilst your hands gently play with one another's lush milk tanks. The room fills with the sweet sound of your mutual purring reverberates throughout Ava's concrete abode in crescendo of feminine feline arousal.";

	say "     Trilling internally at this blissful choir, you cup your thin ebony lips to her catty joy buzzer, eagerly caressing her throbbing sex and nursing her inhuman button with gleeful innervations of your oral muscle. Your touch elicits a pleased gasp from the big-boned cat girl as her larger-than-averaged clit brushes the natural ridges of your predatory maw. Ava's padded paw hands drift to your supple flanks as her claws lightly fondle the sensitive animalistic nerves lining your inner thighs and plush core of your catty lower half. Meanwhile, the not-so-little cunning linguist's delectably large tongue teases your feline flower and tender button with broad sweeps of her pleasantly barbed oral muscle. Ava lavishes your feline sex in a heady constantly shifting squall of decadent dichotomous delights. The texture of her sensuous muff buffing flows seamlessly from the softest velvety of caresses to a ridged erotic tickle as her oral barbs seem to morph in accordance with your body's ephemeral desires.";

While her heavenly smooth pad traces the beautiful black rosettes of your fur-swaddled bosoms in a show of bestial affection. What a good girl, you purr, feeling the tips of her claws dance across your pelt as she tweaks your perfectly perky nips between her thumb and pointer fingers. The sensation pairs so wonderfully with the rapturous innervation of your soft furry bodies grinding against each other. Every fiber of your being sings in choral contentment as your passion reaches a fevered pitch. Your heart pounds and body tenses with base anticipation.";

The sensation of Ava's satin walls clamping down on your eager oral muscle and the gentle caress of her paws on your exotic body push you over edge. As you cum, loosing a feral roar and squirting a heavy trickle of girl honey into Ava's waiting maw as your body is wracked by waves of molten pleasure. The heavyset cat-girl's loving trill soon turns into a fierce cry of relief as she finishes, basting the inside of your hungry muzzle in exotic sweet flavor. Panting happily as you feel catty contentedness washing over you like a cool breeze, you roll on to your back wiping the sweat from your brow and licking your chops clean. Ava collapses beside you, a happy dopy look is plastered on her face as she pets your lower body affectionately while cleaning any excess fluids for your pelt. For a time, no words pass between you. You're both more than content to simply cuddle in your shared many-limbed embrace and caress each other's silken pelts as you wallow in the afterglow of your affair. And sometime later, when the strength returns to your limbs the two of you finally get up, feeling refreshed and ready to face whatever the nanite apocalypse wants to throw at you next.";

Why not do something nice for her and brighten up her day? Perhaps sensing your gaze roving over her exotic form, Ava asks, 'What's up [Name of Player], are you feeling a little hungry?' as she traces a claw down her rows of plump milk tanks. Smirking at the sight, you tell Ava that you might be, though you're in the mood for something a little sweeter than milk right now. 'And what might that be,' Ava asks innocently, cocking her head at a quizzical angle. Smiling, you quip that a helping of girly taur honey would really hit the, you pause to lick your lips, spot. 'Oh,' Ava purrs happily, guiding you over to her makeshift bed. 'I think I might have some, but you'll have to work for it.' Chuckling, you tell her that doing what you love is never work as Ava eases herself onto her tauric backs, putting her curvaceous body on full display for you.";
	say "     To say that the sight brings a smile to your [FaceName of player] face would be an understatement, you muse, observing the beautiful curves of her exotic form, and the cute look of her massive forepaws resting on her rows of heavy breasts sagging along her sides. Not to mention how her heavy hind paws and saucer-sized pads frame her needy pink snatch like an adorable pair of furry handlebars. As Ava fans her voluptuous flanks with her billowing tail, filling the air with the balmy scents of budding feline arousal. You almost want to dive in on the spot and just bury your face in her smooth toe beans; to feel those soft pads brush along your cheeks. Yet, you resist the urge for the moment and just drink in the sight of such a large tauress in recline. It's so rare to find a pure female tauress, that you simply want to bask in the presence of such exotic creature bearing itself to you in all its regal splendor.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Um, are you alright?' Ava queries, breaking your trance. Stammering to save face, you clumsily tell her that you were just getting lost at the sight of such a beautiful girl. 'Ah,' Ava sighs bashfully, 'you really mean that?' Smirking, you kneel down beside her feline flower telling her that it's hard not to, there's just so much of her to love. Running a hand down her animalistic sides, you tell how much you adore her soft gold, white, and black spotted pelt. Working your palms up her hindleg, you remark how her cute kitty toes look like big pink jelly beans, which earns you a little giggle from Ava as your fingertips glide over her velvety pads. Your hands languidly drift to her heavy milky breasts, as you serenade Ava over the wonderful heft and size of her assets, then move your attention over to her adorable fluffy paunch, running your palms over her heavy furry body. A part of you revels at the way her exotic pelt parts before your fingertips as they sink into the sea of burnished gold, polished quartz, and glossy jet laid out before you.";

Tutting, you reassure her that she's beautiful just the way she is. 'You think so? I always heard a lot of mutants say I was a gross taur, so I thought no one liked my kind... except mommy and daddy,' Ava replies, though she squeaks that caveat under her breath. Nonsense, you counter, her exotic form is in many ways far superior to a lot of the silly little bipeds slumming it up in the city. It makes her extra soft, like a giant fluffy hug-pillow, you tease as you lean over her feral half and lovingly caress your cheeks along the graceful swell of her lush middle. You then glide your eager mitt down her flanks, telling how her larger form compliments her exceptional collection of tits, and not to mention highlights her lush lily lips. You swoon, as you lightly kiss her glistening nethers, and enjoying the little shudder that passes through her as your warm lustful breath dances over her sex.";

Glowing under Ava's praise, you decide to add a little more pageantry to your performance. You give Ava a cute waggle of your hips as your lips crest the edges of Ava's voluminous sex, though your mouth is just barely able to engulf her meaty muff. Rivulets of warm taur-honey dribble down your throat, her syrupy flavor playing on your palate as your tongue delves the hot velvety walls of Ava's sizable feral passage.

That wonderful innervation of Ava's tail wound about your throat like your own personal collar and how it tickles your Eve's orange every time she shudders from your skillful oral ministrations. Her handlebar-like legs rub your palms while your dexterous oral muscle plies its well-honed craft is a tactile treat, you opine, gazing at the roiling sea of Ava's golden furry body dotted with isles of burnished ebony, and adoring the way her prestigious mounds brush up against your nose. 'N-Nya someone's enjoying themselves?' Ava purrs, nibbling on her claws at the sight of you prostrating yourself to her delectable form.";

'Mmhh, you look so cute down there,' she says as you try entwining your fingers with her sizable toes. 'Aw,' she coos, squeezing her talons into the back of your hands. The pressure of her razor sharp claws hurts a bit, but at the same time, there is a bit of thrill in locking paws with the gentle tauress. Besides, everyone knows that if you play with a cat, you might end up scratched, you muse, lavishing the doughy folds of Ava's swollen clitty hood with quick skillful darts of your [FaceName of player] tongue till you can feel her not-so-little clit develop a measure of sinfully sweet stiffness.";

You brush your fingertips about the apex of her bestial vulva in loving sweeping motions. You artfully slip your experienced digits past her feral lips as you generously jill her welcoming passage. The tender walls of her supple sex coil about your tactile digits, almost as if they could draw you in. Rather than fight her body's desire, you allow her moist malleable muff to guide your touch. Your fingers are seemingly drawn like living lodestones into her needy depth, lavishing her as you ply your well-honed craft.

Ava roars, 'Oh Mommy!' as she cums, her face burning a bright red under her exotic pelt. Her claws dig in deeper to the back of your hands as you push her over the edge. It doesn't bother though, you're too absorbed in the succulent texture of Ava's wide on to even notice the warm crimson streaks snaking down your arms as he claws rake your [SkinName of player] skin. Your pink treat is all that you care about, that and the delectable trickle of girl juices that rest in your tummy like a warm calming dollop of honey. 'Ah, thanks I REALLY needed that,' Ava sighs, losing her hold on your throat as you clean off the last few drops of girl cum off her sopping feral slit.

Much better, you moan lustfully, loving the interplay of her razor sharp claws and smooth feline pad glossing over the [SkinName of player] hide of your [Breast size desc of Player] breasts. 'Well, mommy gives me lots of practice,' Ava replies, her face awash with genuine affection. Almost melting at her touch, you tell her that it shows, and ask if she'd be willing to give you a full demonstration sometime. 'Sure but not right now. Kitty is getting a little sleepy,' Ava yawns, stretching herself out like a cat about to sun herself. Fine, you tell her, giving her heavy paws a playful tussle, but you expect a full body massage one of these days.";
