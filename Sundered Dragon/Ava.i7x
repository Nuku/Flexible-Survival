	if "Breeder" is not listed in Traits of Ava:
		say "     Standing a solid twelve feet tall when on all fours, Ava's margay taur body easily dwarfs many of the infected you've encountered up until this point. Her gentle citrine colored feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Much like the margays at the state fair that she likely descends from, Ava's humanoid torso is generously endowed with a sextet of P-cup breasts capped by soft pink nipples, with a huggable fluffy paunch. Her humanoid arms, decorated in adorable rosettes, have a pleasing amount of pudginess to them. Ava's hands meanwhile appear mostly sapien in design, small barely noticeable black pads are visible on her palms. Strangely or perhaps not so strangely instead of finger nails, Ava has tiny partially concealed slits on the tips of her fingers housing her long claws.";
		say "     Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body. To the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of domesticated feline though markedly larger. Her furry paws, comparable in scale to dinner platters, appear built more for stalking prey than out right chases, a reality her thunder thighs heartily second. Her undercarriage mirrors her anthro half having six evenly proportioned M-cup breasts tucked between her legs. Sneaking a quick peek at her supple ass, you notice Ava has a [one of]seemingly bottomless[or]canyon-like[or]cavernous[or]expansive[or]elephantine[or]titanic[or]person-swallowing[at random] cunt. Strangely, her plush pink nether lips though unerringly large have a rather human appearance to them. Tied in a bow around the end of Ava's billowing tail is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's log stamped on the corner.";
	else if "Breeder" is listed in Traits of Ava and Libido of Ava is 0:
		say "     Measuring in at a lofty twelve feet tall when on all fours, Ava's margay taur body eclipses the majority of the mutants you've encountered to date. Her gentle feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of Egyptian royalty and cast upon a pelt of yellow amber, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Her anthro half largely resembles the hefty cats in the state fair and is graced by a collection of six plump P-cup breasts topped by perky pink nipples. Since ingesting the transformative cocktail created by Dr. Medea though, her lush body now sports a set of six smooth hairless tendrils growing from her shoulder blades. From experience, you know she has complete control over them and has slowly begun incorporating their use into her day to day life. Her humanoid arms meanwhile are decorated in adorable rosettes and have a pleasing amount of pudgy softness to them.";
		say "     Ava's hands appear mostly sapien in design, with small, barely noticeable black pads visible on her palms and fingertips. Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, instead of finger nails, she has tiny partially concealed slits on the tips of her fingers housing her long retractable claws. Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body, and to the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of domesticated feline, though markedly larger.

Her gentle feline eyes are wide and expressive that never fail to bring a smile to your face regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her catty face is at once both exotic and innocent. Having been knocked up after one of your recent escapades Ava's already plump anthro half has gained a pleasing amount of mass. Her anthro womb is starting to bulge out into a slightly spherical shape. Despite the early stages of her pregnancy her breasts have already swollen to inhumanly large R-cups that fight each other for space. Flushed with raw rich cream, her uppermost milk tanks rest comfortably atop her growing tummy. Were she some manner of pathetic lowly biped, her lower four breasts would sag against her waist. Due to the elastic nature of her skin, her weighty mounds retain an impossibly shapely and perky disposition despite their size."; ["Four legs good! Two legs bad!" Johnny Bravo, probably]
		say "     Still, their heavenly mass wobbles enticingly with her every motion, promoting your lovely playmate to employ a number of her tendrils as a living bra. The rest she uses to mitigate her growing mobility issues caused by her hyper attributes. From what you've seen, she is quite adept in finding uses for them. Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body. To the casual observer, her feral portion would resemble that of a slightly pregnant domesticated feline. Her large furry legs at times seem to struggle with the growing mass of her feral tummy pushing against her P-cups, but she doesn't seem to mind the mild mobility issues. If anything she seems quite happy to use her condition as an excuse to be lazy or pamper her growing body. Not that you can blame her, her distended stomach looks rather cute the way it sways down past her knees and the adorable sight of her milky dugs brushing her well-seeded middle fills your heart with no small amount of pride with the knowledge you've successfully knocked up such a beautiful tauress.";

As her pregnancy advances, you notice her blushing pink human-esque nether lips have grown ever thicker as a thin trickle of dew leaks from the gravid tauress's fertile flower as her hormonal body is enhanced by the effect of her condition. More than once, you've found yourself distracted by the sweet scent of her simmering maternal desire. Spouting from her fecund flank is Ava's incredibly long prehensile tail. Lighty tied in a classical bow near its terminus, is a blue blanket with the Last Chance's logo stamped on the corner. Hidden beneath the dense layer of fur coating its tip though is her ovipositor slit. Normally invisible to all but the most perceptive of individuals, your enhanced senses can easily pick up the subtle coiling scent of feminine desire emanating from the exotic appendage.";

Her gentle feline eyes are wide and expressive making you smile regardless of your mood when her gaze meets yours. Framed by a natural black liner reminiscent of an Egyptian queen and cast upon a pelt of amber yellow, her cat-like face is at once both exotic and innocent. Having been thoroughly knocked up after one of your recent escapades Ava's already rather plump anthro midriff has grown into a glorious taut chubby dome. Swaddled in a thick layer of soft adipose and silky fur, her resplendent tum droops down almost to her knees. Despite her size and constantly soaring weight, the sheer volume of amniotic fluid sloshing inside her combined with the size of your kittens, and the gentle support of her tendril, her plush tummy remains perfectly spherical at all times. Looking closely, you just about make out the blushing pink outline of a cute outie navel beneath her glossy fur.";

Supported by the valiant efforts of her tendrils, Ava's remaining upper breasts frame her well-seeded tum in a jiggling ring of bountiful excess. Flushed with fatty cream, her perky nips hardly need even the slightest bit of stimulation to express. Far from embarrassed by this, Ava seems to take a bit of pride at the light waterfalls of alabaster milk leaking from her chest. A part of you takes a measure of solace in knowing your kitten will be well-fed when the time comes, you can't help but admit you wouldn't mind trying some of her mothers milk too. Perhaps you should [italic type]milk ava[roman type], the next time you're feeling parched. Thanks to their size, Ava's assets completely block her view of anything below them. At this point she's almost completely dependent on her tentacles to support her growing girth, much less waddle around The Chance.";

More than once, you've heard her humming to your kitten, or encouragingly massaging their slumbering forms. Melded to the area where her groin would be is Ava's bestial lower body is dominated by her growing midriff. To the casual observer, her feral portion resembles a comically gravid house cat's. Her thick furry legs can barely support her blossoming stomach and can hardly even fit around the heavy swollen thing as her kitten-bloated belly sways perilously close to the ground. Her animalistic dugs have grown into weighty P-cups, she has to support with her tendrils lest they drag on the floor. Not that Ava cares about her near total loss of mobility, if anything she seems to embrace her broodmother proportions. Despite her encumbrance, her glowing fur is kept immaculately clean, even her claws are sharped to the keenest of edges and seem to shine with some bountiful inner light.";

Even the slightest breeze is enough to elicit a pleased little purr or desperate quiver from her as she struggles with ever-building lust.

Tauric in nature, they would be around twelve feet tall when standing all fours. Their head initially reminds of an average house cats, yet their wide Brobdingnagian eyes and unique facial markings speaks to them more of a nocturnal predator than some lap animal. Adding a measure of credence to this assumption is their luminous pelt, yellow and white with miniature rosettes sprinkled throughout. A feature only present in the designer savannah cat people created some years ago, leopards, ocelots, and... margays! Bingo, you opine mentally patting yourself on the back as you connect the taur's coat with the plump cat girls at the state fair. A hefty creature, the taur's anthro half supports a husky frame with six P-cup fun bags.";
		say "     Fused to their waist is an equally fluffy lower body built in the order of a predatory feline's. Their digitigrade legs have a healthy amount of padding that almost obscures their set of developed calves. Fighting for attention between their legs is another set of six thirteen-inch breasts. Swishing behind them is a billowing tail coated in rings of gold and burnt ebony. Wrapped around the end of this appendage is a small baby blue blanket. She, you realize, is solely female observing her lack of male equipment. Quite the rarity given that most of the tauric Panthera you've encountered tend to be inter-gendered. Then again, she's genus Leopardus after all, but that's neither here nor there.";

The floor, though relatively clean in that there are no bits of dirt or hair laying about, has a good deal of loose paper has been scattered. All of which have random portions expertly cut out. Most of the walls are bare, yet in the rear, you can see what you believe to be the beginnings of a collage made out of old reading material. Or it's her scrapbook collection minus that whole book part. Which would make it more of a scrap wall? You muse as the tauress justifiably interrupts your train of thought.";

She stammers with a nervous light in her eyes as she backs her rump against the wall as if to keep her backside as far from you as possible. Wanting to put her at ease, for you doubt you'd get much in the way of conversation from her otherwise. You inform the tauress that Drake asked you to stop by. 'That's a relief,' she sighs, looking a little calmer, yet she keeps her hind end away from you. 'Oh, my name is Ava,' she adds awkwardly, eyeing you as one would a dangerous animal.";
		else: [Female or Neuter]
			say "     'Oh hi there, sorry I didn't hear you walking by, or I would have tidied up a bit. Please just give me a second to clean up.' The tauress says in a demure embarrassed tone as she hurriedly sweeps the loose leaf paper into a pile with her tail. Explaining to her it's alright, you inform the tauress that Drake asked you to say hello, not inspect her living arrangements. 'Right sorry, I didn't mean to say you were, not that you couldn't if you wanted to. Or that you should, I mean,' she shakes her head sighing. 'My name is Ava, nice to meet you,' she says in a much more even tone. In reply, you give Ava your name telling her likewise, which puts a cute catty smile on her face.";

		say "     Having never encountered a Margay Taur before, you ask Ava how she acquired her current form. 'Huh,' Ava tilts her head, 'I've been like this,' she says looking at you like you've just asked her if fire was hot, water were wet, and the sky were blue. Flabbergasted, you inquired when that was. 'I am not sure, let me think,' Ava props her left hand under her chin. 'Actually, now that you mention it I don't know when I was born.' Your curiosity peaked. You decide to ask Ava if she perhaps remembers where she was born. 'Mmhh,' Ava nods, 'it was this weird place called the State Fair.' Feeling like you're getting somewhere, you inquire as to why she left. Reasoning that as far as you know, most margay infected don't leave the fairgrounds. 'Oh, I was looking for my mommy and daddy.' Ava replies as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Finding this an odd response, you point out since she's part margay, wouldn't one of them be her mother. 'Maybe except other margays don't like me, I tried talking with them, really I tried my hardest, but they would hiss and growl at me saying I was [']too big['] or [']not right[']. The other creatures were just as bad, always chasing me, stealing my food, or trying to shove their gross cocks in my face,' Ava says, audibly gags and looking a little green in the gills.";
		say "     '*Cough* sorry about that,' Ava covers her mouth, 'I got really queasy. So I left, I thought maybe I could find my daddy out in the city. Maybe he and I could look for mommy at the fair. I never found him though,' she says, tucking her chin into her bosom and sighing. You ask why she came to The Chance then if she was looking for her family. 'This,' Ava flashes a blanket with The Chances name tied around her tail. 'I've had it since I was a kitten. I don't know who gave it to me though, but it's all I've had to go on,' she says, crossing her arms as if she were cold. Wondering what happened next, you ask her how her search went. 'Bad,' she peeps, 'most of the people I meet either ran away or tried hurting me. Sometimes I could get them to go away if I gave them my food and water but... not always.' You ask her if she ever fought back. 'Once, but it didn't feel good.' Cocking your brow, you ask if she could be a bit clearer.

It was probably one of the most frightening experiences I've had. There was just something about his expression that said I was less than a bug to him, but then, I saw Kathy standing him clutching her tummy as she hid behind Drakes['] leg. I realized what they were, a mommy and a daddy. For a second I thought they were mine, wait that's not true.' She mews mournfully. 'I wanted them to be mine but... they aren't.' Ava whimpers.

I'm starting to get sore again,' Ava purrs, giving her heaving bosoms a shake for emphasis.

Her lovely pink toes shine like diamonds in the available light while her portly legs are held in a lurid delta which naturally summons the eye to her pleasantly plump pussy, while her tail waltzes about her in a ballet of sensuous need as her billowing furry ovi-tail fans her desperate scent about you. 'Ha-ha enjoying the show, my sweet mate?' Ava coos, resting her paws on the taut dome of her lower body as she massages the verdant mass with her forpaws. Nodding dreamily, you tell her yes, very much. 'Good, because I love what your kittens do to me.

Such a sensitive kitty, she's not going to cum just from this is she? You tease, tracing your pointer finger about the rim of her feminine flower.

You feel your body growing larger by the moment as the raw rush of comforting pillowy softness creeps over your swelling assets. A part of you just can't get over how right these changes have come to feel, as you run a hand through your luminous pelt, blithing at the sensation of the supple fur coating in its tender protective embrace. It's becoming harder and harder to see yourself as anything other than the cuddly kitten you've come to resemble, you ruminate, kneading your powerful talons against the mattress beneath you, enraptured by the tactile resistance of the fabric hugging your claws.

'Ah oh MOMMY!' she purrs with a rich animalistic resonance, flexing her tendrils about your regal physique in tandem with your every kiss and caress. The pleasant pressure pairs perfectly with the rollicking bliss cascading through you as your buds drink in the lingering motes of morphic molasses as Ava's toasty dew sweeps into the welcoming furrows of your tongue.

The thought of proudly displaying these rosy stfeaks fills you with a bit of eclectic energy as you return the gesture, lightly braising your talons along her pliable hide. Meanwhile, you press your frolicsome snout against her alluring meaty pad, desperate to hilt as much of your oral muscle within her as your body can manage, and tighten your grip upon her hindpaws. Warmth floods your muzzle as her hungering walls snatch and grip at your probing laps as if they can somehow coax you to climax while your lover rumbles like a well-tuned machine at each heady motion. Her lustful trill grows from a fine mewling purr to a proud animistic roar of release as one final convulsion surges through her supple body as she finishes.

Your kitten's tendrils still rove and pamper you in a base show of affection that your savage side approves of as you make a show of audibly smacking your chops. Mh, delicious as always, you rumble, running your hand over the sweet balmy swell of your cum-flushed middle. 'Th-thanks I-I'm glad,' she stammers, her voice and expression distant and dreamy as she stretches out her many limbs in a catty display of contentment. Aw is your girl tired, you tease, as you drape your upper half over her lower body and playfully heaving sides. 'Yes, kitty sleepy, but happy,' she yawns, 'say can-can we please cuddle for a bit before you go, please? Kitty, kitty wants to be held...' Ava mews, as her eyes flutter shut as she starts drifting to sleep beneath you.";

Your muzzle sinks ever-so-slightly into her furry chest pillows while your paws lovingly massage her lengthy core as this shared moment stretches on. The concept of time and its passage hold little sway over you, suns could rise, moons could fall, shadows can stretch and recede. Yet, only the tender purrs of your mate, the low sloshing of her milk tanks, and the sensation of her pelt intermingling with yours holds meaning to you as you lie there warm and safe beside you mate. This provincial bliss is short-lived though, as your wanderlust builds, and the nagging call of obligations sinks its uncaring claws into the recess of your mind. Perhaps sensing the conflicting tension, Ava cracks open her eyes, and fixes with a knowing look, whispering, 'It's alright.

At some point, you have to take a degree of responsibility for your own actions, and Ava didn't force you to do anything.

All things considered, Ava spontaneously becoming infectious is one of the more banal things you've probably encountered. 'Hm, I guess you're right.

Looking around, you notice the nearby traffic lights wink on and off like dying Christmas tree lights as the city's failing transit grid putters away the last remaining watts of power as if they were the last waning breaths of some great wounded beast. Here and there you spy the husks of wrecked cars littering the area, some are burnt to the bone. Going by the holes pockmarking blackened hulks, their fuel were ruptured by small arms fire levied by the last stand of the city's police, an attempted spoiling action by the military, or panicked resistance of well-armed locals, you can't be sure. Others are torn up by tooth and claw as if their owners were either pulled from them by aggressive mutants. Occasionally, you notice the luckless car who's canopy has been crushed by some variant of a larger infected creature. Others still are muttered in an oily sheen of dried white flakes of what you assume is cum, or spittle as these same creatures attempt to slake their own hungers upon them.";

That doesn't explain why the place hasn't been looted as you can still make out the outlines of a couple dozen rows of neatly stacked junk food, behind the cashier stand. No way looters and entrepreneurial survivors akin to yourself wouldn't have tried to sack it at the start of the outbreak. There must be something guarding it or some kind of contamination warding the locals away. The possibilities are numerous, shapeshifters, psychics, clever fliers waiting in the wings, or tiny infectious items tainting the area, it could be any of these, or all of them. Still, curiosity gets the best of you as you tiptoe about the periphery of the artifice. You're careful to avoid the ubiquitous bits of trash and shredded appeal lest a clumsy foot fall crunch an errant sliver of glass, or jostle the odd filth encrusted article of clothing littering the city.";

Inside, you spy the sleeping form of wolverine guard curled up in the tattered remains of their uniform. It doesn't take a genius to tell this person was much smaller once based on their current size compared to their uniform. Though the fact they've held on to their clothing and even made some effort to crudely patch a few holes suggests they may still be slightly sane. This presents you with a rare opportunity to try talking to them, if they're not nuttier than a squirrel in a peanut factory. You can just ask them if you can buy a few things. There are enough wallets, purses, and murses scattered around the city that you could probably put a down payment on a house with all the loose change.

If you had a way to deal with them at range, you might be able to pick it off from a distance, or skirmish with it. Since you don't, you'll need to be a little creative. You muse, surveying the environment for anything that can give you an advantage, there certainly is tons of scrap laying around after all. There must be something you can use to extend your reach, you think to yourself, quietly appraising the debris in the immediate area. Once your eyes pass over a massive rod of steel slag sticking out of the back of a broken down truck. You think you may have found what you're looking for. Heading to the wrecked vehicle, you brush through the broken concrete and assorted bits of metal that was likely destined to become another layer of landfill somewhere.";

Indeed, you'd probably throw out your back or shred your palms trying to swing this massive hunk of iron repeatedly. However, if it's just once... well you don't have to be Atlas reborn to pull that off. Hefting your iron slab, you walk up to the edge of the kiosk and whistle as loud as you can. Simultaneously winding back your weapon, you wait for the wolverine to stick its head out. You don't have to wait long, as the mutant is roused from its slumber. With a feral growl its pokes neck out just past the lip of the structure yelling, 'Who's there! What's that noise!' [one of]Hey you![or]Over here![or]Hai yo![or]Heads up![or]Batter up![at random]";

It collides square on with the mutant in a resounding yet somewhat satisfying *CLANG*, that reverberates through your body as metal deforms on impact into facsimile of the creature face. Still they seem to absorb the impact, and for a moment, the two of you are stuck in place staring, until it lurches forward awkwardly like it were trying to make a grab at you. Only to collapse over the side of the kiosk, as its goes cross-eye and it falls face first into the cement with a loud thud. Doing a quick double take to make sure no one noticed you brained the wolverine. You find the area is still clear, and set your deformed weapon next to the pacified creature.

Instead, you content yourself with looting a fat haul of junk food, soda, and as many magazines you can fit in a paper bag from the surrounding area. You even spot a bunch of wallets laying around the area that still have money in them. Going through them all you wind up with a couple hundred American, a stack of euros, and what may as well be colorful play money to you due to how little it's worth from various island nations. You know, now that you think about it, Ava might like the prettier ones. Sure, currency destruction is a crime, but with all that's going on right you doubt anyone will care, you muse.

Folding them up, you walk over to the counter, you lightly rap your knuckles on the metal surface of the counter. At the sound, the creature begins to stir, as a single bloodshot eye pops open. It fixes on as its pupils shrink to murderous pin-pricks as its warped mind tries to parse your existence as it leaps to its feet. 'Wa, who, what do you, what do you want, mutant!?' it shrieks, baring its teeth at you, spittle dripping from its lips as it looks you over.

With each convulsion, you can see the seams fray and patch begin to rip as the wolverine struggles against its nanite-borne impulse to guard this place no matter the cost. Ya, don't think they're coming back anytime soon, can they ring you up? You have cash. You ask in a droll tone, flashing a fist full of dollars. The creature blinks, a look of confusion written on its bestial visage as the fragment of its human personality wars with its nanite influence. It almost looks pained as it stares at your money, for a moment as the rusty hamster wheel in its head turns a degree. 'We are the middle of a coin shortage, so I can't,' the creature snarls biting its own lip till a trick of blood drips down their chin, 'make-make change is that ex-axe-acceptable Mx?' You shrug.";

'Th-thank you Mx please be aware we are a-a-a,' the thing shudders as the veins on its neck bulge and throb like the creature we're caught in the throats of acute tachycardia. 'Paper bags only, Cali-California has banned plastic bags and,' The wolverine bleats, grasping hold of the counter as more violent tremors rack the mutant's body as they struggle to hold itself together. 'That will be $35.73 please know the bag tax is ten cents in this city. Also d-d-due to the pandemic, you will not be able to return these items.' Whatever, you tell them, keeping your expression vacant and placid as you place the exact amount on the counter.";

Still, the addled person somehow manages to collect your money despite the tremors rocking its hulking form as it pockets your payment.

After all, what's the chance they actually are sane, probably near zero. Even if they are, there is a good chance they might try slipping you an infectious item or double cross you.

Looking closely some of the bars appear bent or crushed at odd angles. You suspect, judging from the deep claw marks on the walls, that this was likely done by the local wyverns as they hunted for prey, or mates. You can't think of any others that could reach several stories off the ground and bend steel like pipe cleaners. If there were something like that, you're not sure you'd want to meet more kaiju-sized infected anytime soon, you think to yourself, scanning the skies warily.

While they may not be the most dangerous infected out there, they are not total pushovers either, it could make a lot of noise if it went looking for you and who knows what manner of attention that could bring. No, you need to do this in one shot, without risking the loot.

Thankfully, it's not loud enough to be heard that far, but to the creature it must be quite annoying as you can hear it snarl as it pokes its black furred head out from under cover. That's it, you muse breathing out and squeezing the trigger. With a *Pop* and *Thud* your round hits  square in the temple, slamming the wolverine's head to the pavement with the force of impact. Though you can already see it's starting to recover before you even holster your weapon. Not that you're surprised, it's almost impossible for some of the infected to die, all you've done is give this one a concussion and the mother of all headaches.

A couple minutes later and you've enriched yourself with a fat wad of US dollars, a few fist fulls of euros, and a pile of colorful foreign currencies that are worth more as decorations and conversation pieces than as actual money.

Well, you begin, you were there recently and, you pause to open up your inventory then pull out a bundle of magazines. You got these for her, you tell her, handing the tauress the first batch. 'You did! I can't believe it,' Ava stammers, her eyes go wide with delight as she sizes up the covers on the nature magazines. 'You actually found these, but I uh...' Ava mews mournfully, her ears drooping as she shifts her weight between her paws nervously and sets the magazine down on her davenport. 'I can't accept these.' Wondering why, you ask her how come. 'I don't have anything to give in exchange. Daddy says it's not fair to ask people for help, and not repay them for it.' Shrugging, you inform her you were never expecting to be reimbursed, that you did this out of the goodness of your heart. Besides, you found plenty of supplies there you wouldn't have known about without her tip.";

Ava asks, picking out a brightly colored bill that looks like a miniature gum wrapper in her massive paws. Tittering, you explain its money from other countries and that you thought she might like a few. 'But they're so pretty, aren't they worth a lot, are you sure I can just have them?' Ava asks, eyeballing the large denominations emblazoned on them. Eh, not here, most of these are worth a nickel, maybe less, economics are funny like that. You tell her, handing Ava a small stack of brightly-hued bills. 'Really,' Ava contends holding up a Caribbean note. 'They're so colorful though, I mean look at the blues on this one. Or this one, the foil thingy here looks like mommy's claws.' Ava says, tapping the security strip on another one. It does? It just looks like shiny plastic to you, you question.";

Dad, I mean Drake showed me this picture of what Honey Bees see I told him they both looked similar to me. When I did, he started acting a little weird and he said had to clean something up really-really badly, then ran off,' Ava peeps, stifling a sniffle. 'I thought I said something bad, but when he came back he had these strips of pretty polka dot paper. He made me look at each one and tell him what I saw on each one.' Curious, you ask her how that went.";

'Hm,' Ava taps her chin. 'How can I explain this, the world mom and da-, I mean Drake sees sounds so dull and washed out. I can't imagine what it must be like to be so... blind to-to all this.' Ava says, making a sweeping gesture with her hands and tail. Understandably interested in what she means by [']all this['], you ask her for an example. 'Right,' Ava begins, tapping an erratic tattoo with a toe claw on the cement as she looks around the room. 'The walls, what do you see looking at them?' she asks, bobbing her tail against a barren stretch of wall. Shrugging, you tell her matter-of-factly tone you see gray polished cement peppered with black stone as aggregate and the occasional chem stain. 'That's it?' she asks, with a low tenor of disappointment infecting her tone.";

Ava says pointing to the ground by your feet then turns to the entrance. 'There are patches of vermillion and brown specks by the doorframe where someone slammed their hand, their print is still there too. I know it's not Daddy's. His hands are much bigger and the sweet smell reminds me of mommy, but the shape is wrong.' She says, motioning to the doorway. 'When I look in the corners, I can see a sheen of olive oil colored stuff pooling where somebody did their business once.' She remarks, though a mild shudder passes along the ridge of her feral spine. 'When I look at sunlight or moonlight I see these motes of vibrant purple and waves of metallic blue auroras that look like the picture of seafoam Drake showed me once.'";

Your whole body shines a brilliant bright blue like it's covered in-' Ava, never mind, you think you've heard enough. You interrupt, not wanting to hear any critiques of your post-apocalyptic hygiene. 'Ok,' Ava nods. 'Thank you for this though, these will really help with my project.'

Mommy was showing me this trick of hers, go on show her,' Ava prods happily while running a paw down Kathy's sides. 'Oh all right sweetie, but I don't want to wear them out, so keep your eye on my belly. I'm only doing this once more, ok?' Kathy replies in a cheerful tone, rolling her back and spreading her legs letting her womb slip between her fluffy thighs. 'Ok babies you say hi to Ava's friend,' Kathy coos, rocking her fecund middle while playfully tapping her taut furry paunch.

Not that Kathy minds the stimulation or shows any signs of discomfort as her plush tummy squirms in her arms. Judging from the lewd grin on her as she pampers her lush midriff, the fecund breeder is getting off a bit on the sensations of litter prodding her insides. Seemingly enthralled by the sight, Ava lets out a low pleased mew as she runs her paws over Kathy's tummy purring happily as the kitten kicks her huge pink paw pads.

It will be, you promise flopping down on your back. You leer down at your Rubenesque figure, its full glory on display. A part of you can't help but feel a spark of maternal pride at the sight of the fruitful beast you've grown into. Your nanite-warped mind delights at the sight of fur-swaddled breasts and the sensation of the thick calorie rich milk sloshing within. Running your eager paws over the sensitive tissue, you mentally remark how despite their growing size and heavy cargo your opulent tits barely have a hint of sag. Instead, no matter how big you get, your rack practically defies gravity with its supernatural perkiness.";

Coddled by your voluptuous bosom, your tender midriff looks well at home on your heavy frame as if it were your natural state. A part of you doesn't even mind slowly losing sight of the ground, or your paws as your condition progresses. It's such a small price to pay for the joy that motherhood brings you after all, you opine, running your padded palm over the silky pelt protecting your anthro pouch. Turning your gaze further south, you can't help but grin at the sight of the pillowy gold and black fur swaddling your animalistic womb nestled neatly between your legs. Not to mention, the heady spectacle of your feral dugs that mirrors the decadent portions of your anthro half.

At least without contorting yourself, you think to yourself. With all the walking and fighting you do, not to mention your current state, you'd expect your poor beans to be swollen blistered wrecks, but your exotic limbs bear the hard road without complaint. At least now you can give them something soft to touch, you think yourself, trying to massage your resplendent body. Despite being the size massive saucer plates that they are, your paws can barely reach around the pliant adipose belly cradling your tauric young. Still the struggle to reach your feral linea nigra is worth it, as you happily dig your paws into the inches of soft pudge and fur protecting your kittens.";

Yet your tauric body takes it in stride, if anything your body might be enjoying the sensations. It's probably a side effect of your exotic anatomy, a part of you notes, but your alien nerves are definitely getting some stimulation from all those little paws, you ruminate, feeling a pleasant heat bubbling down your flanks. You try to fight back against the unbidden budding need blossoming between your lush thighs. Without meaning to, you can feel your claws flex and tail fans your warming sex as pangs of desire tease your sensitive form.

But, you muse listening to her content purring, you trust Ava to know her way around someone's kitty. Ava doesn't disappoint either, she kisses and suckles your inverse clit with loving precision as her nose buries itself in the plush tissue of your lush pelt. Cold to the touch, you let out a cute peep as her snoot ruffles your downy belly fur. You can hear Kathy's restrained giggle at your cry, but Ava doesn't seem to hear you, lost in her task.

Sadly, the vast majority see you as little more than a waddling baby factory or an unwilling transmission vector. Given your current state, you can't say you're been doing much to discourage such sentiments and in the case of the former might not even object to being used as such. The fact that Ava still takes the time to pay attention to the rest of you though is still a rare and welcome pleasure, you opine as the gentle tauress's paws roam your lower body, kneading and massaging knots you never knew you had.

You know what she's planning, but you don't even have time to contemplate consent as Kathy roughly spears herself on your muzzle. In the blink of an eye, her plump muff and thick thighs engulf your giant muzzle, smothering your senses with her gold fur, tender thighs, and the sweet scent of seeded lioness.

You feel more than see, Kathy pumps her plump feline snatch stretching over your predatory maw like it were her own personal toy. As her lush ebon cunt takes up more of your vision, you're thankful she at least takes it a bit slow, letting you sneak tiny breaths out the edges of your muzzle. Whether that's on purpose or due to her massive litter weighing her down matters little to you. At least you can breathe between Kathy's thrusts, and try to concentrate on your own performance. Something tells you she's not moving till she busts a nut even if she has to kill a few brain cells in the process, you think to yourself taking hold of Kathy's door jamming sides to lend her your support.";

A part of you wants to buck and howl with lust like the beastess you resemble, but the living muzzle of Kathy's sugary leonine pussy turns your frustrations into adorable little gurgles only you can hear.

You muse on this while riding out the waves of hormone-addled pleasure as Ava laps at your feral clit as if it were her own personal lollipop and beads of Kathy's fem cum drips down your furry chin. You know you wouldn't trade bodies with any man or herm. Pregnant sex is just too good, your nerves are just so wild and raw when you have all these wonderful hormones in your bloodstream. Even the slightest breeze can set you off. Judging from the level of heat and dew radiating from Kathy's slopping cunt, you know she feels the same.

Her short fall is thankful cushioned by your collective pudge acting as a natural mattress. Utterly sated, the purring tiny lioness snuggles her portly frame atop you, kissing and kneading your fur as your own climax approaches.

'See, that is how kitties['] paws are supposed to look, clean, fluffy, and with a nice tuft of fuzz in the middle.'

Gazing down at your expansive body on full display before you, you can see your bloated wombs quake and jiggle with sudden activity. As a dozen little paw shaped bumps push against your supple body, it almost looks and feels as if your wombs are recreating a scene from a famous movie about aliens.

The pair works their fuzzy digits over your impressive collection of nips, kneading and groping your erect teats between their padded fingertips.

Though, out of the corner of your eye, you watch as the former showgirl, purring happily at your offering, tucks a sneaky tail between her thunder thighs. Your enhanced feline hearing picks up the soft sounds of her shamelessly playing with her lush feline sex while she chows down like a proper hedonist.

Ah this seems nice and ready now, you think to yourself guiding your tauric tail between your matronly nether lips. You can sense your plush pussy parting perfectly at the welcome intrusion while still hugging your tail like a living mold.

Though her back is turned to you, you can vaguely see her arch her spine so that her belly pushes out prominently.

True Orthas might not be able to lay enough eggs to give her a real bump like Kathy's, but everyone has to start somewhere. You proffer.

True, the nanites may handle things like morning sickness, and you don't have to bother with childcare, or the horror of diaper changing. However, your exotic body still gets a tad worn down from all the extra weight, giving you back aches at times. On top of that, you are always growing a few cup sizes with each litter. The first few sizes may have been fine, and maybe even helped with your body image. Now though, it's almost to the point where you're just ready to stop looking for new bras at this point and embrace the commando lifestyle. 'That doesn't sound fun, I thought you always seemed so happy when you're pregnant,' Ava says with a concerned look on her face as she eyes up your fecund form. Shrugging, you tell Ava that at times it's true, the pregnancy hormones definitely have that effect on you especially when you're horny. You occasionally also have a certain sense of pride at bringing life into the world, but there are a lot of little things about being a gravid taur that make life difficult.";
			say "     'Like what,' Ava queries, swishing her tail nervously. You inform her things like the occasional swelling in your joints you get after walking all day is one thing. The loss of mobility that accompanies your condition creates some of the bigger issues. You tell her, it can be quite difficult to maneuver some of the tight places in the city where everything is designed for [one of]tiny[or]meager[or]puny[or]lesser[at random] bipeds. You have to be on constant alert for narrow passageways lest you get stuck, or rough terrain that could nick your lower body. 'That does sound scary, I can't imagine what that must be like for you.

Sighing, you try explaining the estrus cycle, the differences between the human and animal versions to her as well as how the nanites have overcharged it to aid in their propagation. That you routinely have to struggle not to seek out the nearest feline with a dick every couple of days, in order to quench the burning need the nanites force upon you. 'Oh you mean the tingle, dad, er Drake gave me something for that.' Ava replies, sauntering over to one of the tool cabinets and pulls out a bright pink circular pill container. Looking it over, you instantly recognize the design as generic birth control pills, like the ones schools or women's health groups occasionally hand out. You surmise Drake must be giving them Ava to keep her heats or [']the tingle['] as she childishly calls it in check.";

Already, you can almost entirely slake your thirst on your own supply, but when you're expecting your rich cream becomes even more nourishing and seems to improve your nanite-induced healing factor.

Ava asks, tilting her head questioningly. Shrugging, you tell her you're not sure, the nanites sort of take care of everything, so you never really have to think about a pregnancy until it's time to give birth. Even then it's pretty tame compared to what people normally had to go through before. You just have to find a place to lay down then let nature take its course. In a few minutes, the kids are full grown so the whole affair it's really anything special, or difficult to you at this point. 'Are you kidding me? You really don't notice a thing.' Ava queries, poking your tummy.";

It's not all bad though, you sort of like the way it feels when your body brushes against something soft, you simper, patting your plush feral womb with your forepaws. One of these days you wouldn't mind heading down to the beach and walking in the surf letting the soft sand cushion your paws, and the gentle cool waves lapping along your taut skin, you trill, running your hands along the supple length of your feral half.

Getting to watch your body grow round and resplendent with life, and how your skin gets so sensitive. She has no idea how good it is just to walk around the plains, feeling those blades of grass ticking your distended womb and feral teats as your regal body sways delightfully with every step. Not to mention, the way it affects the rest of you.

Everything just tastes and feels so good now. She has no idea how blissful it is just to have someone pet your fur or massage your paws. 'Really? Then can I, um, touch you?' Ava asks bashfully as she rocks back and forth nervously on her paws. Chuckling mirthfully, you tell her you'd be offended if she didn't.

That was a kick right,' Ava gushes excitedly, as midriff squirms lightly at her touch. Yep that was, you gasp feeling the light quickening of your latest litter.

You ask, flashing her a toothy grin. 'What?' She replies. You have her to thank for it, this body is just perfect for you. You simper, as you stand on the tips of your toes and steal a quick kiss on her cheek. 'Oh,' Ava blushes, 'I really didn't mean to infect you, but I am glad you like the results.' You do, you purr contentedly giving your tummy a loving pat, and tell her you hope that answers her questions.

Purring at the touch of her meaty pads brushing up against your doughy tummy, you lean into her caress telling her you're never sure.

Still there's nothing like being a big preggy taur, you sigh with a note of maternal pride as your paw at the growing roundness of your golden waistlines. 'You really enjoy being a mommy, don't you?' Ava quips, seating her voluptuous form beside yours. Nodding, you tell her for the most part you do, but the nanites and this beautiful body she gave you really help out with that. You don't think you'd enjoy yourself anywhere near as much without it. Taurs and pregnancy just go together like chocolate and peanut butter, you answer, playfully groping at your soft fecund form.

I think I just felt one of their tiny pawbies push against my palm. Could you feel that too?' A little bit, you admit, it does feel kind of nice actually. It's almost like someone hugging you from the inside and out, you reply, gliding your feline digits over the lightly churning mass of your furry womb marveling at how big you're getting.

'No what happened?' Ava answers, pausing her exploration of feral bump to glance at your wiggling anthro belly. Gesturing to your navel, you tell her one of your kittens just grabbed your finger.

It won't be long till it fully pops out into an even bigger and cuter outie you muse, playfully pinching a thick roll of furry pudge between paws before giving it a gentle shake whispering encouragement to your rumbling tummy. For a moment, nothing happens and the room is quiet, save for the low gurgle of your cub-stuffed womb and sensuous sloshing of your milk-filled tits. But perhaps responding to their mother's loving stimulation, your little ones perk up with a sudden flurry of activity.

Ava coos, gesturing to the tiny paw prints created by your quickening brood dotting your glowing pelt. Of course, you tell her. You've got plenty of padding for them, you add with a proud joking tone while giving your hips a hearty slap. 'Oh you're just the best!' Ava replies, running her sizable digits over the taut rim of your navel. Your little ones react to her touch almost at once. Their little paws all seem to gather around Ava's fuzzy feline fingers. You can practically see perfect indentations of their toe beans through the fur and adipose of your gravid taur tummy as they grab at Ava's digits.

You're like a giant plushie,' Ava quips more to herself than you as her kiss slowly transforms from gentle pecks to long sloppy licks as she grooms your bloated tummy fur with the sizable barbs of her feline tongue. Her free paws work their way down your animalistic sides, affectionately groping your bestial nips. Well, isn't that what girlfriends are for? Besides, it'd be unfair to keep all this to yourself, you serenade, jiggling a paw full of milky taur tit right under Ava's chin just to watch her flustered lustful expression as beads of pure white cream seep between your fingers.

More than a little excited to find just how heavy you've gotten, you grab hold of your portly mound, reveling in the weight of the thick layer of adipose and dense core of amniotic fluid swaddling your adopted child as they rest comfortably in your lush paw pads. With a low grunt, you gently heft the growing mass of your turgid tum just above the analog scale then gingerly lower your bundle of joy onto the scale, listening with no small amount of pride at the sound of the metal gears grinding under the weight of your little one.

Right, you tell her that her name is Ava and that she was the one wondering if it were possible for two biological women to have a child.

'Right now, I'd say the easiest option would be some estosterogen pills, rather than attempting something so invasive. They're non-transformative and should allow you both to grow male genitals without compromising your female anatomy. I heard some were being tested in the city hospital before the cataclysm as part of some weird bluesky HRT project. I am sure you could find some there, you could just bite the bullet and find a donor male or herm.' Shaking your head, you inform the good doc, Ava is a bit agoraphobic and borderline misandrist at times, so that option is out of the question. 'Then I'm not too sure what I can do for her,' Medea replies, shrugging her shoulders. Oh come on doc she's dang fertility genius, she's made cunt pills, ovi pills, mpreg pills, learned how to give people control when they get pregnant, and even figured out UB. This should be nothing for her!";

I don't imagine you could just waltz into that place without a keycard or staff member to show you around.' Not a problem, you tell her, you've been there before and have some knowledge of the layout. 'Ah then let me just get a list together of what I need,' Medea replies, swishing her tail towards a nearby file cabinet tucked in the corner of her office. For the next few minutes, the good doctor digs through various poorly-organized drawers. Eventually, she comes across what she's looking for. 'Here we go,' she says, plucking out a number of manila folders. She quickly skims them without showing you the contents and jots down a list of items on a bit of scrap paper. Looking it over it appears she wants: fresh fish from a very specific industrial canning facility in the warehouse district, a slew of exotic chemicals, and some equipment whose name has more umlauts than a page in the average German phonebook.

Reciprocating her greeting, you bring up Ava's question about the possibility of two biological women having a child together and if she might have the means to facilitate this. 'Sadly, no,' Medea replies, clicking her toe claws against the floor. 'With the pandemic going on, options are rather limited. Right now your best option is finding a donor male or herm, I am sure there are quite a few willing mutants in the city.' Medea quips, with a devious smirk. Shaking your head, you tell her Ava is rather set on having a kid with you specifically. 'Then the easiest solution would be to find some estotrogen pills, they should grant you both male anatomy without compromising feminine attributes. If memory serves, you can find them at the city hospital. I recall they were part of some experiential HRT program, but I don't know who ran it or why though. The A.P.A doesn't exactly recognize intersex dysmorphia as a valid mental disorder, yet.'";

Maybe when things blow over you check around and see what's in Ava's price range.' Medea shrugs. Really there's nothing she can do? You ask. 'Well,' Medea hums, tapping her muzzle thoughtfully, 'maybe but it won't be easy. Let me check some of my notes and I'll see what I can do,' Medea replies, gesturing to a nearby file cabinet. 'But I should warn, some supplies and need better equipment, hotplates and mess kits can only get you so far.

His faceguard awash with a soft blue light of his monitor as he tabs through pages of spreadsheets and background programs. Recalling the list that Medea gave you, and reasoning that since Matt is the last sane member of the research staff left, as far as you are aware at least, he might have some knowledge of where to find these items or at the bare minimum, point you in the right direction. With no other leads, you clear your throat to get his attention. Lost in his work though he doesn't respond, forcing you to rap your knuckles roughly on the glass. Shocked by the sudden noise, Matt leaps to his feet in a panic, knocking over his office chair. He grabs a nearby red staple gun and points it around the room frantically like it were a handgun as he swivels his head in blind fright looking for the source of sound with a terrified expression seared into his face. When your eyes meet, you throw up your arms in mock surrender, jokingly telling him to not shoot.";
	say "     At the sound of your familiar voice, Matt's expression softens as he loses a light chuckle. His gaze drifts from the stapler to the reinforced glass wall protecting him from the horrors of the outside world. The man appears to calm down a bit, and asks what you're doing here, stating that he's in the middle of some important tests that demand his full attention. Wanting to respect his work, even if you don't fully understand what it is, you then give him a brief censored version of events. Explaining how you're assisting another doctor studying various aspects of mutant reproduction and need some supplies from the lab. Nodding along, Matt, likely intrigued, asks to see the list in question. Flashing him the thumbs up sign, you press the list to the glass, and notice the light of recognition in his eyes as he reads off the items. 'Hm, under normal circumstances, I'd have to turn down such a request. However, considering all you've done to support the cause, I may know where these are, but,' he pauses to click his teeth, 'you'll need a keycard to enter that section of the labs.'";

	say "     'Give me a moment, I think there's a visitor's pass somewhere in here.' He says, motioning to the poorly organized clutter littering his campsite. He kneels down beside a pallet of sealed office snacks, his hazard suit squeaks loudly as if somewhere rubbing to over inflated balloons together as shift through the pile of supples. 'Ah, this should work.,' Dr. Matt remarks, as he pulls out a bright yellow keycard from under a pile of half eaten instant noodles that like their home to a budding colony of scoby cakes. 'The items you're looking for are in Isolation Lab Alp-69 sub-level 1, Access Point Primus. I would strongly recommend bringing a strong rucksack or a dolly with you if you truly intend to ransack the lab.' Why is that, you ask. 'Well the,' Matt pauses as he takes in long deep breath, 'Schäfer-Nägele-Göring-Köhne-Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff-Jorgen-Von-Strangle-Jager-Bombastic-Rothschild-Habsburg-Vandercunt-autonomous-exo-lab you're associate is seeking is powered by an advanced Stirling radioisotope generator.'";
	say "     Normally, we employ a forklift to move it, but,' he shrugs as he looks over your tauric figure, 'I'm sure your current form will manage it, somehow,' the doctor replies, as he plucks a lightly used napkin from his suit pocket and scribbles something that looks like directions on the back with a nearby pen. 'You'll need these too,' he says dryly, tucking both the card and napkin between his pointer and middle finger, then flashes his chicken scratch in your direction  'After the outbreak, a number of highly sensitive experiments were left... unattended far too long.' What sort of experiments, you query, naturally curious about what manner of hazards you may encounter. 'The need-to-know kind,' Matt grunts, causing the budding crows feet ringing his eyes to twitch ever-so-slightly in aggravation, though whether or not this sentiment is directed at you, or something else you can't say. 'All you need to know is that when containment failed, much of the lower level was damaged, and several passages collapsed in the resulting chaos,' he says, in a lighter tone, motioning towards a tab on his workstation labeled: Deadman's Hand Protocol.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Going by the last ping sent from the building's automated custodian, I doubt you'd be able to find your way in without them.' Dr. Matt adds, as he flicks open the two way airlock separating the two of you and places the note along with the keycard inside. With a quick practiced motion, he quickly punches in some manner of code, or command, you can't be certain from your current angle into the pad beside the airlock before sealing it, then waits patiently as the device cycles. Seconds later, a light on your side flashes green as the aperture hisses and opens, loosing a low pungent fumes of sterilizing chemicals. While he watches you pocketing both items, Matt loudly clears his throat to get your attention. '*Ahem* [name of Player], do be careful down there.' You tell him not to worry about it. You're a big girl and you can handle whatever is down there. 'I should hope so [Name of Player], you've been a,' Matt pauses, parsing his lips as if searching for the right word, 'passable assistant throughout the outbreak, your loss would be a shame,' then turns back to this work without sparing you another moment's notice.";

You pour through countless defiled labs and ruined passageways dotting the underground catacombs. The air grows more humid and oppressive, the scents of mold and decay war with one another for primacy as you trek deeper into the abyss. Many of the paths you cross show signs of mutant aggression as the innumerable scuff marks dotting the floor all tell the sad tale you've seen far too often on the surface. You muse, observing the trail the heel prints and nail scratches, and claw marks scattered about the floor where some luckless soul was dragged off into the gloom. Gradually, these signs of resistance fade as pieces of what may have once been a bright orange cleansuit litter the ground like luminescent bread crumbs as whoever this once was seemed to have succumbed to their infection, you note, as you spy the unsubtle change in the scrawling blemishes belighting the ground grow closer in shape till at last they become indistinguishable from one another.";

The labs fare little as most appear to have been host to some manner of stampede, or wild mass exodus of their previous occupants as ruined priceless equipment and rare chemicals litter the floor like common trash on the surface. Others though are far less fortunate, as the building plumbing and waste water pipes have ruptured like benighted cysts spilling countless gallons of foul-smelling liquid into them, ruining anything of value they may have contained. More than once, you come across a lab with its HVAC seals still intact and flooded to the rafters as if it were some mockery of a bottle garden.";

Alongside it, you spot the wriggling bright yellow forms of plasmodial colonies glomming onto the walls, and partially translucent Cnidaria tendrils shaped like a prismatic helix spotted with glowing red nodules reminiscent of the boiling plasma found on the rims of accretion disks spirals aimlessly through the murk. Observing the blobs movement, you can almost feel the hate and... envy, radiating off from the distressed primeval eyes of the fetal mass as they longingly stare at your [bodydesc of player] [bodyname of Player] body.";

They must have been one of the staff here, or perchance, one the former staff descendants that got caught in there when the pipes failed, its current appearance, likely an unfortunate result of nanite's attempt to keep it alive in whatever manner of carcinogenic slurry it now finds itself in. A part of you doubts if the creatures could even leave their fetid cradle at this point, at least in their current state. Who knows how much of their minds are still intact, or if it would even be possible to change them, you remake internally, watching a light fog form around your palm print. You observe the fetal creature swimming next to it, its crude misshapen limbs flailing akin to some emaciated palsy victim, as it tries to place its crooked hand beside yours, though you use the term in the loosest possible sense. The tainted appendages graying flesh is spotted with chem burns both old, and new, its digits twisted as if they were suffering from Dupuytren's contracture as its rubbery calloused fingers struggle to stay unclenched.";

Its weeping gums are riddle with sickly yellow phosphorescent cysts, and a thin bone spur-riddled tongue nestled along the rotten appendage. Stretching its maw at an impossible wide angle, the thing lunges at the aluminum crystal barrier with unnatural speed, its impact sends a resound quake through the floor beneath as its fangs shatter on the artificial sapphire. Caught off guard by the explosion of violence as the creature batters its unearthly maw against the wall, heedless of the damage it does to itself, you stumble back and slip on an errant puddle of some nameless viscous ooze. You're sent tumbling back, and collide with a door leading to a darkened adjacent lab. The aperture holds for but a moment, then gives with frightful metallic knell as you fall into the all-encompassing gloom with a loud thud.";

Your senses are greeted by the sweet pungent tang of ozone mixed with organic decay like some great inferno had raged through here. As if to confirm these suspicions, you note the presence of a melted lab bench tucked in the corner of the otherwise vacant room and the huddled charred remains of a cleansuit curled in a ball beneath it. The former occupant was likely in the throes of nanite conversion as you note the former human's carbonized form is draped in boiled blackened plastic akin to a shroud, twisted far beyond the acceptable norms of baseline humanity. Their legs are bent at alien insectoid angles that end in long scything claws. Their jaws are split down the middle and lined with saw-like fangs akin to some abyssal fish while tendrils longer than the victim was tall sprout from their back and tailbone. Its hands though, are still human, and in them is clutched an intact, if somewhat singed metal storage clipboard.";

Looking at the picture, you see a middle-aged, if somewhat overweight, latino man with almond eyes, rosy dimpled cheeks, a kind weather beaten face, and glossy, oiled, slicked back hair dressed in a tuxedo.

You then turn your attention to the binder, leafing through the pages. You realize that its an inter-lab shipping manifest belonging to someone called, worker class code 5192 R. Mendoza, in it you find a number of the items you were looking for have been moved to the hazardous testing and isolation lab Alp-69 along section, access point Primus.

Peering at the edges, you spy a number of generic warning labels in different languages dotting its edges all warning staff to keep clear when the safety shield is being lowered. Given the size and presence of motorized grooves, which aren't all that different to ones you've seen used to shutter stores.

The slimy thing still slips through his grasp and vanishes under the hood, leaving you both in stunned silence. Unsure what to make of what just transpired, you nervously paw at your brood-swollen middle, wondering what this could mean for you little one. Perhaps sensing your distress, Kluaz nuzzles your hand reassuringly, while he rubs his sleek predatory form against you as if to comfort you, and his perceived daughter.

Mulling your options a tad more, you finally settle on a middle option. By salvaging bits of furniture, lab equipment, and cast off clothing you can Macgyver something like sled or skip, tie a rope to it, and haul it up the stairs.

Although you have no idea who would buy it given the state of the city, logic has never stopped such people before. No reason to assume a little thing like the apocalypse will change that, you muse, drifting down the alleyways till you are about two addresses away from the canning facility. As you're about to round the last corner, you hear an odd burst of static followed by the dulcet tones of a male singer. Despite the occasional skip of the player, his voice is regal, smooth, and clear. Even the gentle clash of the waves and low thrum of sea birds seem to hush themselves in reverence to his cadance. Accompanying him, is a skilled band of well-tuned brass and lively drums playing something that sounds like classic pop. Straining your ears, you can about just make the words.";

She takes them over to a slightly less cluttered section of her livingspace, pulls out a hotplate, mess kit, and a multitool from one of the nearby drawers. You watch as she flips out a can opener, as now salivating Medea cuts open the tin, drops the contents into a mess pan and puts it on the hot plate. Setting it to medium, Medea plucks a vial of white powder from the pile of chemicals you collected, cracks the lid, and sprinks the substance into the pan while jostling the contents as the room begins to fill with a gentle oceanic aroma spliced with mouth-wateringly sweet citrus scents. Curious, you ask what chemical she's making or distilling.";

Perturbed, you inquire if you've just been on a glorified food raid. 'N-n-no...,' Medea answers in a childish tone as she stares intently at the pan to avoid eye contact. 'Well, ok maybe a little, I can assure you though, the rest of these things are completely necessary for my work. Scout's honor,' Medea says, briefly placing her left hand on her heart and raising her right like she was being sworn in at court. Right, you reply dryly in annoyance.

Sure, your reply, saunter up beside her, you take hold of Ava's massive paw and are struck by both the glossy sensation of your entwing pads neatly gliding against each other, but the strength of your larger lover's grips paw as her hand fully encompasses your own.

You coo, nuzzling your [bodydesc of Player] muzzle along the side of her fuzzy arm, delighting in her sweet alpine scent and soft caress of her spotted fur tickling your cheeks. 'Much,' Ava simpers as you guide her through the wreckage. The pair of you gingerly pick your way past the wreckage, till you come to Medea's office and politely knock on the door announcing your presence. 'Come on in friend, you have great timing.

You reply in an even tone, cocking an eyebrow at her. 'I, um, you see, I-I, *gulp*, may have had a few bad experiences with larger infected individuals,' Medea peeps, sounding like she's on the verge of a panic attack as her eyes dart around the ruined sections of the building searching for something though you can't say what. 'Oh, I understand,' Ava frowns, looking at the damaged building with a mote of understanding in her eyes. 'I'm so sorry to have troubled you Miss,' she says apologetically, bowing her head.

So please do come in, you should see the fruits of her, and my own labor,' Dr. Medea replies, her tone brightening a bit as she gestures for the two for you to enter. Following her lead, you both squeeze into Medea's office and take a seat beside one another on the floor while Medea pulls out a pair of vials from her coat. 'Right, so I don't know how much [Name of Player] has told you much about this, but thanks to her I been able to isolate a number of command code from infected with, well let's call them,' she hesitates a moment, tapping her toe claws in a thoughtful rhythm searching for the right word, 'unusual reproductive strategies. From them, I've been able to isolate a series of genes and nanomachine commanded codes that should, in theory, enable two biological women to reproduce without male or herm assistance. Regrettably, I can only bind it to a single pureblooded strain.'";

Furthermore, if you're transformed even partially, I can not guarantee this treatment will survive the process. So if you have any desire to take on a different purebreed form, I would recommend doing so before you take this,' she concludes, placing a clear glass vial with a glowing pink fluid sloshing inside of it each of your paws. Well that shouldn't be a problem. As far both of you know, Ava was born a Margay Taur, so you doubt that she can even be transformed in the conventional sense. Now that you think about it, she's probably the original too, you reply. 'Really, is that true?' Medea asks, fixing Ava with a clinical inquiring stare. 'Ya, I was the only one for a while, until I,' she wavers, a note of deep-seeded shame lacing itself through her otherwise bright tenor, 'infected her. But it wasn't on purpose, I'm not a monster! I'm not like those things out there, I swear!'";

'Oh I didn't know that, it must have been quite a shock for both of you, but for what it's worth, I believe you,' Medea says reassuringly as she paws up to the massive tauress and gives her shoulder a gentle squeeze. 'But I'm going to assume [Name of Player] that since you've decided to keep this form you're happy to stay in it.' she adds, turning to face you. Grinning, you tell her that your new body has grown on you in recent days. If you have to maintain it to have children with Ava, that really doesn't seem like a problem to you anymore. Besides, if you ever have your form compromised Ava can always just reinfect you no problem. 'Hm,' Medea says, tapping her muzzle.";
	say "     'If that's the case, it would ensure you can never truly lose your enhancements. There is a good chance that it could even be passed to offspring. In time, it might even become stable, perhaps even ingrained enough in your strain that it can affect other infected, and even baseline humans. I know there are quite a few lesbain couple who would kill for the opportunity,' she adds with a lewd, toothy, reptilian grin. 'Um, I have one question Miss. This isn't going to make me grow a nasty cock or something?' Ava asks, holding the vial before between her thumb and point claw as she hesitantly peers at the contents. 'What, no of course not, I pruned every gene loci, and scrubbed every line of code relating to phalli. Don't misunderstand me though, your bodies will change, I had to make some creative workarounds,' she chirps in a proud trill, as she motions to her ad-hock lab with a flick of her tail. 'You wouldn't believe how hard it was to stabilize. I ended up having to pull some junk code from some other sample left my former patients to fill gaps and prevent rejection.'";

'Right but what's a fall-eye and gander inversion?' Ava asks, cocking her head to the side. Dick, Ava, she means dick, as in she's not going to grow one and suddenly turn into a hyper herm or some yucky dude, you tease. 'Well that's good, I think I'm ready to do this now. Are you?' Ava says, swirling the vial's contents in her paw. Nodding, you tell her you're more than ready, so, cheers, you titter, clicking your vials together, and downing the exotic slurry in unison. Mhm tastes kind of like a thick chalky strawberry milkshake. What do you think Ava? You quip smacking lips as you feel the strange chemicals tickle your stomach lining. 'I like how fatty it tastes, kind of like mommy's milk mixed with pepto. I don't feel any different though when does it start to-, oh. This feels nice,' Ava chuffs, 'like someone's pushing on my tummy from the inside.' Ava purrs running a paw over her anthro stomach.";
	say "     Placing a paw over your own rumbling middle, you find yourself agreeing with her. Although you recognize the sensation as something more akin to indigestion. The feeling spreads down to your lower half only to concentrate itself in your tail and anthro back. Then just as quickly as it came, the pressure breaks like a fever, leaving you with a needy empty feeling in the pit of your belly, not all that dissimilar to one of your feline heats. Your body however remains unaltered, except for a slight draft along the tip of your tail and trapezius of your anthro back, whipping the limb around, you spot the first change almost immediately. Parting your tail fur, you're pleasantly surprised to find your body has grown what appears to a faux-ovipositor slit. Curious, you stroke the length of it feeling a raw meaty tube hiding inside of it connected to something down near the base of your feral hind end. Your analytical side surmises it likely leads to either your current ovaries, or perhaps another specially adapted set.";

	say "     Letting go of your modified limb, you shift your focus to your back, patting the area around your shoulder blades. Your padded fingers soon find the other alteration as they brush against a smooth set of six tendrils. The fresh appendages, that are a little longer than your tail and not all that dissimilar to a Tentacle Horror's limbs, are clustered on either side of your spine. On first touch, your body doesn't recognize them as being a part of you, they feel cold and deadened to you like they were injected with way too much novacaine. Sensation slowly trickles into them though as your body's nanites adapt them to your current nervous system. In moments, you can exert a modicum of control over the new limbs even though doing so is about as easy as typing when your arm's fallen asleep. This too seems to fade and with enough time, you're sure that you'll be able to manipulate them just as easily as you would any other appendage. Turning your attention back to Ava, you see she's playing with her own ovipositor.";

But, I've never seen one of these back here before, how is this even going to work.' Chuckling, you saunter up behind her, you wrap your tail around hers, instructing her to turn around and you'll show her. Assuming the doctor doesn't mind the show, you ask, casting a glance at Medea, who pulls up a stool, mobile privacy curtain, and a clipboard. She swiftly seats herself, giving you the thumbs up sign as she wheels the cloth divider between you and her. 'Oh, I love it when you take charge,' Ava trills, squaring her legs and presenting her plush hind end to you. Not for the first time, your tauric body shivers with delight at the sight of your larger mate's cute cavernous cunt and lush feral dugs on full display. Her posture and needy heat-laden scent excites your senses as you leap on her back, mounting her the way your exotic body prefers. A low purr escapes your lips as you drape your voluptuous body over hers.";
	WaitLineBreak;

You cheekily snake your tendrils about her anthro breasts in a living bow while you guide her tail-mounted ovipositor with your own to your sweltering feline flower, mewing encouragement for her to do what her body tells her to as you massage her egg laying limb along the lush lips of your feral vulva. Mewling in agreement, Ava's newly forged limb surges through your grip, spearing your lush, drooling, heat-engorged muff. 'So warm, I never knew I could feel this good,' Ava coos as her virgin egg-slit brushes your inner sex, stretching the sensitive tissue in the most sinfully sweet ways. Chuffing happily, you lean your anthro torso against hers, nibbling on her kitty neck fur. You whisper tender nothings in her ear as you kiss the nape of her neck while you playfully grope her lush milky bosoms. You sink your padded hand paws and collection of dexterous tendrils into her bloated milk tanks, delighting at the silky caress of her fur along the smooth surface of your fingers as your elated digits sink into her taut creamy mounds, creating the little impression in her engorged tit flesh.";
	say "     Massaging the hefty orbs, you can practically feel the milk wallow within them as you tweak Ava nips as you goad her. So ripe and heavy, she's going to make the perfect mother with these, you bet your kittens will never go hungry. Still, you tease, fluffing her furry bosoms, you can't wait to see how big they get once you get a few litters under her belt and she has a nice big tummy to cushion them on. You snake your exotic appendages along the edges of Ava's heat swollen lips like you were hotdogging her lust-flushed cunt. Her tender petals clench and crinkle around your sensuous limb as you exalt in the innervation of her warm dewy lips caressing your raw ovi tail-cunt. You're almost surprised at the level of sensation your modified limb is able to experience with each stroke of Ava's plump breeder's box. Where once you would have likened your prior tail play to a rough fingering, the fresh nerves of your ovi slit and the alien tissue lining tail is almost on par with your cunny. Your body's burgeoning instincts demand more though, and you're quite happy to oblige them.";

You practically swoon with elation, as your walls massage her ovi tube with deviant alacrity, the heat-fueled muscle clenching around her tail with a desperate inhuman vigor. With every bestial thrust of her soft girthy limb, the subtle changes to her become more apparent as your slick channel brushes the soft ribbed cartillage and muscles lining her modded limb in concentric ring.You rumble with raw passionate delight at the sensation of those exotic bumps and pleasant valleys gracing your satin box as you dig your foreclaws into her fur.";
	say "     That's a good kitty, keep going just that, and you'll earn yourself a big belly full of kittens, you croon as you lightly kiss the points of her ears and your padded palms drift to her stomach. Running your paws through the soft pliable fur, you ask in a teasing tone as your claws braise the lush equator of her tail stuffed tummy, if she's looking forward to being your personal breeder. 'Yes,' she mews, as her paws join yours, 'yes, fill me! I want to be as big as mommy, no, bigger! I don't want to feel empty ever again,' Ava cries in a heat-fueled caterwaul as she wraps her tendrils around you, hugging you close and groping your lush curves. Of course, you tell your eager little kitten factory, you promise you'll keep her full from now on. You'll never see your paws or the floor again. From now on whenever you look down all you'll see is a nice tummy packed to the brim with cute baby taurs and a fat set of bloated milkers. By the time you're rescued you'll have hordes of obedient margay taurs waiting on our every need. She won't have to move a claw, or be lonely ever again.";

I can't wait to see the look on her face when we come waddling home with a basket full of kittens for her to play with,' Ava coos mischievously at the thought. Her body twitches with excitement as she caresses her feral undercarriage fondling the outline of your egg-laying limb with a clawed forepaw as her sweltering passage seems to clench your exotic limb. That's right sweetie, you doubt anyone will be able to keep her paws off her when they see that nice belly swaying between her legs. You trill delightedly as an unusual stiffness and pressure slowly builds along the base of your tailbone.";
	say "     Far from unpleasant, the lurid sensation seems to grow with each meaty thrust of your ovipositor. Your exotic muscle tenses as your egg-laying limb seems to ripple like a wind sock in a gale. As the new specialized muscles push along the first of many gel-like eggs, no larger than a cantaloupe, you can feel the soft-shelled embryos bloating your mutant canal almost to the edge of some forbidden elysium as they rapidly pass their way through your sordid appendage. A part of you feels like you should be bracing for a rush of pain or discomfort as the tender tissue spasms wildly with each false contraction. It never comes though, as your aberrant nerves and exotic muscles sing in rapture instead with each little ripple as the egg parts Ava's plush lips. You can feel her seemingly [one of]bottomless[or]canyon-like[or]cavernous[or]expansive[or]elephantine[or]titanic[or]person-swallowing[at random] passage stretch with your eggy bounty, your needy tauress gasps for breath crying, 'Oh yes [Name of Player] don't stop!' as she paws at her feral stomach, caressing the impression of eggs as one after another of your soft-shelled ovum stretches her hypertrophic passage in ways few could ever hope to.";

'Oh mommy, its so [italic type]*RAWR*![roman type],' Ava roars in primal satisfaction as her ovipositor undulates within you as her egg-laying muscles spasm to deliver their precious cargo alongside a gush of feminine honey. You can feel her tail swell with their size as they press against your feral half. You find yourself panting in anticipation. Your heat-tainted body wants nothing more than to feel those gooey eggs inside you as the first ovum forces your tight cunny to part like the Red Sea. Fuck yes! You purr sensing the exotic bulging ribbing of Ava's ovipositor and her gelatinous eggs innervating your [Cunt Size desc of Player] snatch with their passage in a steady stream, like boba passing through you like a crazy straw. You swiftly lose count of how many eggs pass your sodden sex.";
	say "     Your senses become overloaded with maternal bliss as your womb swells with their presence, forcing your [breast size desc of player] tummy tits to fight for space around them. Your body groans and heaves before you with untold bounty as their passage hits you like a chain of erotic firecrackers being set off in your core. As the last egg nestles itself into your waiting womb, you find yourself sporting a pair of taut stomachs that would put an octomom to shame. Unable to resist touching them, your tendrils and paws fondle the sensitive fatty orbs as you trace the outline of each egg. Casting a glance at Ava, you can see she's equally enthralled with her litter as she dreamily massages her sagging tummy with her paw-like hands as if to confirm its presence, saying, 'Wow this is all mine, I can't believe it. I've never felt so huge before, it's amazing. Everything feels so raw and tender, I don't ever want this to end.'";

She hasn't experienced half the fun yet, as your back tentacles grope her expansive pot belly and pendulous breasts. 'Ours mh,' she simpers, smacking her lips as if to taste the word, 'I think like the sound of that,' Ava trills, gently leaning her anthro half against yours. You drape your arms around her larger frame, hugging her doughy form close, telling her that you hope so. You might be planing on having a lot more litters after this one after all. 'Good, because I want to fill the world with our kittens,' Ava purrs dreamily. 'You know if I could. I'd arrange for every girl I have to have your charms. So every minute, of every hour, every girl could have a chance to find what I've found in your arms,' Ava swoons. Nuzzling your muzzle against her cheek, you tell her that's sound like a lofty goal, but one that you could be very eager to assist with. 'Heh thanks,' Ava mews, kissing your feline muzzle."; [Ava is quoting Dean Martin's song, 'Everybody Loves Somebody' here.]
	say "     'Now let's head back to the Last Chance. I don't want Drake to worry.' Nodding in agreement, you tell her that sounds like a good idea. Besides, you can't wait to see the look on their faces when they see your augmented bodies. Not to mention, you have some things in the city you like to keep an eye on. Much as you'd enjoy cuddling with Ava for a little while longer, time is rarely on your side. 'I know, hehe, mommy is gonna be so jelly when she sees us,' Ava replies as you dismount her. Turning her attention to the good doc, Ava continues saying, 'Oh and Doctor Medea, I can't thank you enough for your hard work. You've made me the happiest girl in the world.' Parting the blinds, Medea swifty drapes her clipboard over her dripping groin and tells Ava it was her pleasure. She also invites both of you to come back for a follow up visit anytime if there are any complications. Nodding, the two of you tell her that you'll keep that in mind and gingerly make your way back out of the office after you collect your things.";

As you walk, Ava gushes over the experience and peppers you with questions on what to expect in the coming days. All of which you are happy to answer. Besides, it's a good way to kill time on the trip, waddling your way back to the Dry Plains. Three hours later, the two of you are almost in sight of the Last Chance and Ava stops in her tracks saying. 'Hey, I was thinking you might want to wait out here for a while. You see, I kind of didn't tell them what I was planning and well... It might be better if I had a few minutes to explain this to daddy on my own.' [italic type]What?![roman type] She didn't tell them about what's going on? You query. 'Mh-hm, I wanted to make it a surprise,' Ava says, shrugging as she squints and makes a cute blep face at you. A surprise, oh dang it did she even make any plans on how you were going to feed or house our kids. Just imagine if they come out her size!";
	say "     Does she have any idea how hard it would be to keep them at The Last Chance? You stammer at her audacity. 'Oh, I was going to send them off to live with you. I've heard you're staying in some kind of huge bunker complex with a big library building nearby, so you should have plenty of space. Besides, your kids seem to be able to forage just fine. I'm sure a few more mouths to feed won't be a problem,' Ava replies as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Rumbling in annoyance, you tell her she's not wrong. You've gotten quite adept at whelping ardent survivors, and yes the Abbey does have a good deal of space. You'd prefer it though if she ran things past you a bit more from now. 'Of course, I promise I won't do anything like this again without consulting you first.' Ava says. Shrugging, you tell her you're going to hold her to that. 'Thanks I knew you'd understand, now let me go talk with daddy.' Please do, you can already feel the crosshairs on the back of your head, you reply gesturing to the pillbox atop The Last Chance as Ava heads off."; [This is a Gears of War reference.]

	say "     Making your way along the road to the Last Chance, you overhear a minor din of activity from behind the curtain wall. Listening closely, you can just barely make out the sounds of pained grunts and claws scraping along the blacktop. Fear like you've never known grips your heart as you rush to the gate, heedless of danger as your maternal instincts scream at you to find and protect Ava and your kittens, no matter the cost. Bounding to the gate as fast as your legs can carry you. You kick the thing open and unsheath your talons, ready to fell anything that threatens your family. However, the sight that greets you is not what you'd expected. Gathered in a circle in the courtyard, you spot eight Margay Taurs who you instantly recognize on some intrinsic level as yours. Each one is as large as Ava and covered in strips of blue powder from head to toe save for their paws, which are dyed red. They appear to be circling around a shirtless Drake like a pack of hunting cats.";
	say "     In his hands, he wields a pair of crudely carved foam tonfa covered in the same blue colored dye coating your children's fur. The sight makes your choler rise and bubble as you're about to scream at him and demand to know what he's doing to your precious babies. But a slightly slimmer Ava yells for attention as she runs over to your side from inside the garage. 'Hey [Name of Player] you're just in time to see the end of today's lessons.'  Lessons? You query, eyeing up the improvised thunder dome you've walked into. 'Ya daddy's teaching them how to fight as a group. He says wants to make sure they're able to hold their own out in the city if you guys ever get separated. They're doing pretty good actually, one of them almost landed a hit before you got here,' Ava replies proudly. 'Ya,' Drake huffs, sounding a little fatigued but nonetheless pleased. 'Your girls are pretty quick on the uptake. Don't know if it's the nanites, or their parents['] good genes, but your kitten here are fast learners.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Ah, thanks grandpa Drake,' one of your daughters remarks as she swipes at Drake's legs with her left hand as if she were about to claw his torso. Despite her nanite-enhanced speed, Drake backpedals around the blow. A word or two of advice bubbles then dies in your chest, as you realize that her attack was a feint as she swings her forepaw at him. Once again, she's too slow though as he ducks under her limb and slashes at her leg, leaving a fresh blue smear on her pelt. 'That's your leg gone sweetie,' Drake grunts rolling away from her as your daughter tucks her paw into her side. 'You ladies need practice working together! Don't come at me one at a time anymore. You're more than your sisters, you're a pack, er,' he hesitates, his catty amber eyes rolling towards the clouds then back to your kitten, 'pride, you should be more in tune with each other. So let's go, AGAIN!' Drake bellows sounding like a football coach, bashing his tonfa against each other releasing a cloud of blue powder while he takes a formless guarded stance.";
	say "     'YES SIR!' Your girls roar in unison as they circle about him like a proper pride. With no small amount of joy, you watch your daughters launch feints and probing at their prey, forcing Drake to split his attention between them. His movements are quick and fluid as parries and dodges your little ones strikes with practiced ease. Yet, you can see the limits in his defenses conferred by his lesser bipedal body. He only has two arms, two legs, two eyes, and a reach of a few feet. Your daughters meanwhile are not so inhibited, as they press their tauric advantage, attacking in groups of three. They claw, kick, and bat at him with their natural armaments from every direction. Drake struggles to keep up. His body twists and weaves around the savage attacks like he was made of water and wind, not flesh and bone. Tough as he may be, his body and the nanites can only be pushed so far.";
	WaitLineBreak; 
	say "      Sweat glistens from his brow and pours down the toned hills of his sternum like a river of shimmering diamonds, his pecs heave with each ragged breath as he ducks one of your daughters paws and tries unsuccessfully to aim a riposte at their under belly. Your girls however have hardly broken a sweat as they dance between each other, careful not to impede their litter-mates['] avenues of attack and egress. Large as they are, you imagine it would be easy for them to trip over one another. Still, they keep a rough cohesion without speaking despite their inexperience. You can almost taste the air of inevitability as their train of blows rain down on the little human's guard forcing him to his knees. '*Huff* *huff* don't get cocky girls, I'm not out of this yet!' Drake pants as he lunges between your daughter and slash at their undercarriage while he passes under them. 'Your down hun,' Drake rumbles rolling out from underneath as your daughter feigns a collapse. 'Come on girls, I believe in you! You're not gonna let some old man show you up in front of your moms!' Drake jeers climbing to his feet, with his back to your daughter's prone form.";
	say "     'Heck no!' one of them cries, charging in like a bull seeing red as she tries to swat him with an over-handed swipe. 'Ha, good effort sweetie, but you shouldn't break rank,' Drake sneers, leaping back and slashing at her paw. He lands on your defeated daughter's side, motioning for the rest of them to come at him. Your daughter stares at the blue streak on her paw for a moment before charging again, but this time she's not alone. Two others join, trying to pincer Drake between them. No way is he getting out of this, you muse, watching five sets of red paws come down at him from different angles. At the last moment though, Drake jumps and bounds between their outstretched arms as he slashes at their faces. 'Fudge,' you hear one of them grumble as they playfully collapse on another in a pile. 'No fair grandpa, you're so small, how can we hit you!?' one of the girls moans exasperatedly from underneath her litter-mates.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'That's what girls got to figure out. Your opponents are not going to tell you how to defeat them,' Drake quips as he lands atop them. Looking at them though, a part of you wonders if Drake is going too far, but squeeze on your arm from Ava stops you as she says, 'I know it looks like he's being mean, but don't try to stop them. I begged daddy to teach them and not to hold back. You've been out in the city, you know what the mutants would do to them if they got a chance.' Blinking back a tear, you nod telling her, you know all too well. Then turn your attention back to still standing kids and yell encouragement to them. Your little one's ears perk up at the sound of your voice as the remaining four circle back around him. Pacing around Drake, an odd look passes between them as each seems to eye one of his limbs. 'Ah, got a plan this time girls, or are you waiting for me to keel over from old age? Give it another sixty, seventy odd years and that just might work,' Drake laughs, his lips curling into a proud yet oddly toothy grin, revealing a pair of saber-shaped canines.";
	say "     Don't answer him girls, you got this! Remember your moms are rooting for you! you cry. 'Ya get them girls! We believe in you!' Ava cheers, clutching your arm tightly in her paws. 'Ha, hear that ladies, you're not gonna let your moms down now are you?' Drake taunts through a happy rumble. 'No way!' They bellow in unison as they regroup. 'Good! Now,' the big man pauses as he takes a deep audible breath. Watching him exhale, you notice a pair thick white wisps of steams coiling around his fangs as all tension and fatigue seems to leave his body and a look of peace and anticipation blossoms on his lip. 'SHOW ME WHAT YOU CAN DO!!' He roars as your daughter charges in. Drake whirls tonfa about him warding off blow after blow yet with his focus locked on their flurry of paws and claws. He doesn't notice their tendrils lashing out and grabbing hold of his arm. Panic and just a hint of respect runs across Drake's face as tries to slash at it but his balance is thrown off as other daughters['] tentacles latch and toss him to the ground.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     In flash, they leap upon and sweep their dye-covered paws across his chest. 'That's you down grandpa,' one of them taunts, adding a little flourish of red to his sternum. 'Ha-Ha-ha, I guess so,' Drake chuffs as they let go of him. While he pushes himself to his feet, you get a good view at where your girl [']hit['] him and have to suppress a laugh as you realize that they've drawn a red smiley face on Drake's abs. Looking down at the mark, the man lets loose a light chuckle as he congratulates your remaining daughters. 'Good job girls, I think you guys have got the hang of things, just don't skimp on practice. You should remember that you won't always have the advantage of numbers, size, limbs, or the luxury of attrition. Although considering who your other mother is, [italic type]*TZK*[roman type]' He clicks his fangs and shrugs. 'I could be wrong about the numbers part. Still, you did good, with a little practice. I'm sure you girls will be able to handle most of what the city can throw at you.'";
	say "     'But please, watch each other's backs, and,' he smirks, cocking his head in your direction, 'take care of your mom out there. She's a good woman, you're lucky to have her.' Drake says, giving you an approving nod. 'Anyways, I'm gonna get washed up, and give you girls some space. Oh Ava, don't forget I have some water warming on the roof of the garage if you want to give them a proper bath. I don't think you want to lick the dye off. It's not edible,' he adds, motioning to his core. 'Sure thing dad,' Ava replies as Drake makes his way up to Kathy's room. Once he closes the door behind him, Ava lets out a deep sigh saying. 'Oh mommy, that was a little hard to watch.' Patting her on the arm, you tell her you're inclined to agree, but understand why she put the kittens through that. Better they learn how to fight here, than out in the city where the consequences are a bit more dire. 'Thanks, I'm glad you understand,' Ava says, giving you a big fluffy hug.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Oh moms, don't be so dramatic, that was kind of fun,' one of your dye-smeared daughters says as she tries dusting off her pelt. 'Ya, it sort of felt like we were dancing after a while, though I wouldn't mind a bath. My skin is getting really itchy,' your daughter who got her belly slashed says gesturing to her underside. 'Also, we kind of need names. Mommy Ava said she didn't want to give us one till you got back,' your daughter who got her paws bopped adds. 'I, um, second this, it feels weird not knowing what to call myself,' yet another of your daughters chimes in. You don't see why not, but how about you give them a bath first. It looks like they got into a fight with an angry paint mixer, you joke, gesturing to the blue dye marring their pelts. When they're all clean, we can think about names. How does that sound?";
	say "     'Great!' your girls answer in unison as they line up in an orderly fashion for you. Leaning over to Ava, you compliment her on teaching them to queue so soon, most adults never figure that one out. 'I didn't, they sort of just knew, they must have 'learned' it from your side,' Ava says, throwing up her paws. Shrugging, you tell her that you guess so and ask if she can grab the water Drake mentioned. 'Sure thing!' Ava replies jumping up on her hindleg and plucking an arm full of gallon-sized milk jugs off the roof and sets them in a pile at your paws. Passing one back to her, you tell Ava to hold it over your daughter's head and slowly pour it out while you scrub them down. Ava nods and the pair of you spend the next few minutes cleaning and bonding with your kittens. Like your prior progeny, they seem to have inherited much of their mother's emotional intelligence, and already seem to have the minds, if not the bodies of adults.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Although they seem to have few gaps in their knowledge base compared to your earlier broods as they admit they barely know how to read, write, or do basic math. From experience, you guess it might have something to do with the fact you weren't the one who breastfed them. When you bring it up with them, Ava and the kitten's express their agreement. To the letter, you girls are a little bit curious about what they missed out on and ask if they could try suckling to see if that might balance them out. Flashing them a reassuring smile, you invite them to your breast one at a time, enjoying the brief profound moment of connection with your kittens.";

Her ears perk at the sound of the gate clicking closed and turning her head to face you. As your eyes meet, Ava waves you over with an excited look on her muzzle. Padding over to her side, you coyly ask her why she looks so happy to see you today. 'Cause I have a surprise for you. Can you guess what it is?' Ava replies, her tail happily swishing behind her. Well judging from her lack of tum, you surmise she's given birth, though you don't see your kids anywhere. 'Daw you ruined the surprise, though I guess I should have worn a baggy shirt or something,' Ava pouts, playfully stomping her back foot. Tittering, you remark that you doubt she could find one her size. 'Ya... oh well surprise ruined. Ahem,' Ava clears her throat, '[italic type]KIDS, COME ON OUT[roman type]. Your other mother is here. It's time for you to meet her.' Ava shouts in the direction of The Chance.";

Returning the gesture, you ask them about their names and how they've been. 'Um, they don't have names yet [Name of Player]. I thought about it, and after all the work you did it's only fair that you get to name them.' Blinking in surprise, you tell her you don't mind, but you might need a few minutes to get a better sense of who they are first. 'Sure, come on girls take a seat by us, I want you all to meet your other mom,' Ava simpers, gesturing for your children to join her in the garden.

Here, your daughters admit that they are not really all that literate or know much in the way of math. This strikes you as odd, your previous broods generally seemed to know everything you do. Then it hits you, your past litters were all breast fed and carried by you, so these girls likely only know what Ava knows. Perhaps, you offer if they suckled from you. You could share your wisdom with them. It would far easier not to mention faster than trying to teach on the fly.";

	say "     Drawn inexorably back to the Last Chance by your ever-growing maternal instincts, you're pleasantly surprised to see your latest batch of kittens and their mother waiting in a loose circle together in Drake's Garden. Even their [']Grandfather['] seems to be sitting cross-legged in the middle of their gathering, with their backs resting on the bronze marker at the center of the garden. In his lap is a large-by-human-standards light blue plastic ring binder, stuffed to the gills with plastic sheet protectors, that he seems to be showing to your cubs as he gestures to the pages. Although from your current angle, you can't see the pages contents clearly, you still spy something that looks like old photos or cards arrayed in even rows tucked into the pages. Curiosity piqued, you begin to shut the entrance to the Chance behind you before heading over to see what's going on. At the sound of the gate being shuffled back into position, Drake looks up at you and as your eye's meet, the man passes the binder to Ava and beckons you over with a wide proud toothy grin and eager wave of his hand before leaping to his feet.";
	say "     As he strides towards you, it's almost impossible not to notice his fangs have grown somewhat longer since you last saw him, as their pearlescent serrated edges poke out from his lips. Strangely though, despite prior reticence towards his partial transformation, he seems oddly at peace with this and makes no effort to conceal them behind his once dour expression. Perhaps your kitten's presence is softening him to his changes, or he's showing them as a way to bond with your little ones. Regardless, you take a measure of comfort that the cubs and him are getting along, especially after Ava, [']surprised him['] with your first litter. Open-minded as you may be, a part of you wouldn't have held it against him if he took a measure of umbrage at the sudden imposition. Still, as he paws up to you with a relaxed stride, you can't say that you're not a touch curious about his presence. As you gallop over to the redwood walkway crisscrossing the garden to meet him, you tactfully ask Drake what he's doing. 'Ah, the kittens were curious about-,' he hesitates a moment, as a brief look of reluctance grows on his chiseled visage, then vanishes behind a proud leonine smirk.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'My side of the family,' he replies with a casual bob of his head in the direction of your little ones. 'So, thought I'd break out the family photo-album, a lot of history in that and in the name, not all of it good though. Speaking of which, I got something for ya,' he rumbles as he motions for you to wait a moment as he fishes around in his pants pocket. You feel your nose twitch as the breeze catches and with come the scents of stale oil, organic decay, and the lingering tang of carbonized matter impregnating the dust around the Last Chance sweeps through the area. Then, just as quickly it came, the gust shifts again, and the smell is gone, replaced by the sweet perfume of the garden alongside the calming aroma of your assembled family. 'Here,' he says, in commanding a patriarchal tone as he passes you a tiny polaroid, 'I took a few of these right after the girls were born, figured you might like one since you couldn't attend,' Drake grumbles in low annoyed tone as you take the picture from his hand.";
	say "     You reply in a level tone, that you would have come if you could, but it's hard to plan these things with the state of the city, and the speed at which some people can come to term now. '*Hrump* I guess you're right, you're doing your best with your situation, which is more than can be said for a lot of would-be-parents nowadays,' he retorts with a heavy shrug of his well-muscled shoulders. He gestures to the stricken city with a jab of his left thumb, eliciting a low groan from the too-tight fabric of his shirt as it struggles to contain the big man's nanite-enhanced physique. 'Still, you should hang on to it, it was hard enough to find self-developing film for my old camera before the apocalypse, and uh word to the wise [Name of Player], don't let any of the latex fu-,' he growls, in a harsh steely tenor reminiscent of your first encounter when he held you at gunpoint as the rumble in his chest grows loud and more bestial and he bares his fangs in a predatory grimace.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     His slitted eyes narrow to fine umbral pinpricks, cast in unflinching citrine, if only for a moment. However, as the bright happy giggle of Ava and your kittens worms its way through these sour notes as they flip through the binder, his grim expression evaporates like morning fog. Drake seems to relax, his countenance shifting to a more casual, relaxed state. 'Creatures, even the sane ones, see it. Crazy as this may sound, a lot of them like to eat these sorts of things,' he finishes his sentence. Really, you ask, fixing him with an incredulous look. 'Ya,' the big man clicks his fangs in annoyance, though you can tell it's not directed at you but rather at some unpalatable memory. 'They act like it's some kind of delicacy, don't know why. Suppose it has something to do with the type of plastic, the chemical used in making it, or the way it looks. Not sure really, I haven't had much opportunity to talk to them either. Most of the ones I've run haven't been the... [italic type]talkative type[roman type],' he adds, huffing the phrase with a baneful yet sanitized edge as he glances back at your kittens out of the corner of his leonine eye. Right, you tell him you'll keep that in mind as you level the picture with your catty snoot and look the thing over.";
	say "     You're immediately greeted with the acrid stench of gunpowder imparted by Drake's touch and a vague chemical fume you struggle to place a name to. Your heart, nevertheless, is warmed by the sight of a tired, yet all-too-happy looking Ava reclining on her mattress. Though her fur appears rather damp with impossible perspiration, and her natural eyeliner seems to have darkened just a hair, her expression is one of pure bliss, as nestled in her massive arms are eight of the tiniest, cutest fluffiest kitty taurs you've ever seen, each one is no larger than your hands once were when you were but a puny biped. Their adorable stubby legs can barely even wrap around their mother's arm as she holds them for the camera. Gazing at their eyes, you note that they're an interesting mix of smoke blues and earthy browns, likely a sign the little dears are still somewhat blind and deaf like many new born felines tend to be. While their sweet button noses are a flush shade of pink much in the order of their pads."; [Author's note: According to some gun nuts I know, discharging firearms for prolonged periods can cause the smell of gunpowder to cling to your hands. Cue the more you know GIF.]
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Peering closer, you notice something odd about the kittens['] fur, namely the pronounced absence of the creamy white splotch they seem to have now. Offhandedly, you surmise that this is likely some remnant of their animalistic origins as it is not uncommon for some species to have their hair change color as they age. Considering your own urge to immediately nurse and age up your own brood the instant they're born, combined with the heady brew of maternal hormones swimming through your mind during such occasions, you realize that you never truly thought, or more likely possessed, the clarity of mind to inspect them properly. Even now, you sense a growing urge to feed these lovely kittens nibbling at the back of your mind, you muse as beads of sympathetic cream begin to leak from your chest. Before you can address this, the sound of Drake's voice calls you back to reality. 'Beautiful aren't they?' he asks, rather warmly. Yes, you reply, doing your best to bite back the tears of joy welling within you as thank him for this precious gift.";
	say "     'Don't worry about it [Name of Player], you did right by me and mine, it's the least I can do,' the big man answers with a graceful wave of his hand as if to brush the matter aside. 'Anyways, I'll leave to your, er, thing with the girls,' He adds as walks past you and gives you a respectful pat on the shoulder before heading off to see Kathy and his own kittens-to-be. 'Oh Ava!' Drake hollers from the foot of the staircase. 'Yes daddy?' she answers, as her ears perk up at the sound of his voice. 'When you're done with that,' the big man says, motioning to the binder with a casual flick of his wrist, 'remember to put it somewhere dark, a lot of those photos are pretty light sensitive.' 'Sure thing dad!' she replies, flashing him a respectful smile, as she flips through some of the older looking sections. 'Good girl,' Drake chuffs, as he strides up the stairs and slips into Kathy's room. As he shuts the door behind himself, you notice him sliding something that looks like a dingy white sock with a large hole in the heel over the handle.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Chuckling, you roll your eyes at this, and amble on over to your family, arms held wide as you invite them over. Rumbling happily, your kittens bound toward you in a great fluffy stampede as they crowd around you. Your daughters take turns hugging you in their many-limbed embrace as they pepper you with questions about your own family. Doing your best to calm them down, as their voices and inquiries bleed into one another like a musical squall of mutual fascination, you tell them that you will share your own past, in due time. Though admittedly, you don't have anything as storied as Drake's album on hand, you add, mentally noting how some of the section dividers have little annotated names and dates on them stretching all the way back to the eighteenth century. Not all the names are in proper American English either, a few are written with Yiddish, German, Polish, and even Creole characters. Perhaps though, you can offer them a bit of practical knowledge instead, you reply, motioning to the little beads of creams forming on your chest.";
	say "     After all, the world's a rather dangerous place right now, it's more important to arm your kittens with the skills they'll need to survive and thrive out there first. 'Aw but I want to hear about your side of the family now!' one of your kittens sitting on the edge of the garden pouts, roughly thumping her tail along the ground in an aggravated tattoo. 'Now-now little one,' Ava retorts, as she slips her tendrils about your grumpy child's forepaw and gives it a loving squeeze. 'You should listen to her, she knows better than anyone else how dangerous the city is and she's only looking out for your best interests. Besides, she'll have plenty of time to tell you lots of exciting stories while you're traveling together,' she says, glancing in your direction with a motherly grin on her face, 'isn't that right my sweet mate?' Responding in the affirmative, you tell them of course, and who knows, they just might get a crash course in their family history if they nurse enough.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Really? Me first then. I want to know everything about mommy!' your previously incredulous kitten declares, her tone brightening too excitedly as she eyes your nips with pronounced interest. 'See? I told you girls, your mother is such a wonderful person, now come here, she needs to name you all too,' your matronly mate quips as she motions for you to join them. Rumbling happily at the invitation, you pad over them and seat yourself in the center of the garden where Drake once sat. You note how the wood still carries motes of his warm and slightest hints of his catty musk mixed with light wisps of gunpowder, though you pay their presence little mind. Instead, you roll on your side, exposing your rows of animalistic dugs to your cubs as you summon your eager daughters to your breast. Mewling affectionately, they nod and cuddle up beside you, gleefully tucking their adorable lips to your nips and proceed to suckle. A feeling of unbridled warmth floods your being as your maternal mind basks at the connection this simple act brings along with sudden flush of potential names for your eight children.";

Eager to check in on them, you quietly paw up to them, as you get nearer though, you notice another set of comparatively tiny foot-paws poking out between the entwined forms of your slumber brood. Tilting your head in curiosity, it takes you a moment to place a name to the tawny gold pelt and supple black toes intermingling with burnished golds, nacre whites, and lustrous jet fur, then it hits you.

She smirks, flashing you a devious Cheshire grin as she languidly rubs her tail over the plump swell of her own overripe womb.";
	say "     'Heh-heh, you bet momma Kathy, we can't wait to meet them!' yet another of your daughters swoons, as Kathy strokes her luxurious fur. 'Ya it will be so fun to let them ride us all around the plains, and show them all the cool stuff you've shown us,' one of your daughters seated on the periphery comments in a dreamy tone. 'I want to play with them too! Just imagine all the fun we'll have with our little sisters and baby bros,' one of you daughters seated next to Kathy adds, as she crawls forward and nuzzles her chin along [if Thirst of Kathy is 3]your co-conspirator's[else]their minder's[end if] resplendent middle. 'And you will dear,' Kathy purrs expectantly at the touch of daughter's whiskers tickling her sides. 'Well, one day. For now, I think they need a little more time in the oven. Besides,' she rumbles, cupping her paws about her uppermost row of delectable D-cups, idly admiring their heft as beads of fresh cream leaky between her fuzzy fingers, 'the little ones really know how to bring out my flavor,' Kathy teases, as she hooks a drop of pearly perfection on the tip of her pointer claw and draw the succulent rivet to her lip.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Wouldn't you all agree?' she coos, languidly lapping at the tasty treat, as her tongue coils about her talon's sickled edge with a deliberate slowness. 'Ya, Momma Kathy's milk is the best,' your brood cries in unison over the hungry rumbles of their stomachs as they pull themselves closer with their forepaws. You feel your temper rise at both the perceived insult to your bountiful cream, and the odd slavish reaction of your kittens. However, before you can even think to give voice to these thoughts, Kathy raises her left paw-hand. 'Now-now little ones, don't say that. You're going hurt your [italic type]other[roman type] mother's feeling talking that, and you all wouldn't want that now would you?' the matronly lioness implores with an enchanting trill, gesturing to you with a magnanimous wave of her paw. 'No momma Kathy, we're sorry,' they whine, ears drooping below their forehead and halt in place. 'Ah,' Kathy huffs, puffing out her chest as she motions for them to listen, 'That's better, but you should be apologizing to [Name of Player], not, me don't you think? Why, you haven't even tried your mommy [Name of Player]'s milk yet, now have you?'";
	say "     'No,' several of them mumble, as your brood turns their attention back to you. 'We're sorry Mommy, it's just... Momma Kathy is so yummy, I guess we got a little carried away,' one of your kittens kowtows, as she traces nervous circles in the walkway with her forepaws. 'May-may we please try some of your milk?' Well, you begin, letting the word hang in the air like a lure as your kitten's fix their needy expectant gazes upon you. Maybe, but you might like some privacy, this is a very personal affair after all, you add. 'Oh don't be like that dear, we're both mothers so there's nothing to be bashful about, and besides from what Ava's told me the experience will be rather enlightening for all of us,' she chuffs through a toothy jovial grin, as her thin black lips stretch back into a predatory smile. Hesitating, you wonder if perhaps you should ask her to leave, but the hungry pleading looks of your latest litter quiets such thoughts. All-and-all, what's the harm in letting her observe, you muse, beckoning your little one's to your side.";

	say "     'That's the spirit dear, now come here, lay your head down on my lap, and get nice and comfy. It must have been so hard walking all the way out here, you deserve a chance to rest,' she titters, spreading her lush legs out before you as she fans her inviting tail about her well-seeded figure, impregnating the air with her soothing, motherly, catty scent. Eyeing up her pillowy thighs, and the lingering drops of alluring alabaster cream clinging to her tawny pelt like pearls floating upon on a sea of flowing molten gold, you feel your eyes drooping and any reticence you may have had ebb as a sudden pang of primal hunger simmers though your core at thought of sampling such ample fare. 'What's wrong dear, are you feeling a little hungry too?' Kathy hums, her cadance both warm and inviting as she leans back on one arm. 'Don't worry, I have plenty of milk to share with [italic type]my girl's[roman type],' she says, beckoning you forward with a luxuriant come-hither gesture. Her fecund body wobbles enticingly with her every breath as a barely audible groan emanates from her decadent D's.";
	say "     Unable to resist the tempestuous scene playing out before you, you nod, then seat your [bodydesc of Player] head in her lap, allowing her toasty pillowy thighs and downy soft pelt to cradle your catty head in their lush supportive folds. As the matronly lioness brings one her lowermost nips to your lips, she mews, 'Go on dear,' as she gives the plush orb an encouraging tender squeeze, eliciting a light trickle of lustrous alabaster ambrosia from her stiff perky teat. Spellbound by the sight of her gleaming offering, you eagerly press your muzzle to her chest, your sizable maw effortless encompassing her leaky milk spout in their loving embraces as you suckle. You're treated to a pleasant rush of warm calming fatty cream, coating your far-traveled palate in a delectable sheen of rich milky delights. Delicious, you purr under your breath as your barbed tongue explores the tight puffy contours of her tit as you drink. 'Mh such a hungry mommy,' Kathy swoons, brushing the side of her paw along your cheek, 'don't let any go to waste, you won't want to set a bad example for your cubs now would you?'";

'Good girl[if Perception of Player > 30], your all coming out so well[end if],' she trills in a light whisper, tracing her talon along your chin, sending pleasant sparks of catty contentment through your cuddly core at her doting praise as your own [Breast size desc of Player] teats thrum with activity, seemingly in response to her voluptuous potent cream. You soon feel tiny pearls of your vivacious milk seeping from your ripening body. Rumbling happily at the sensation of pure maternal purpose coursing through you, you can't resist pawing at your supple mounds before beckoning your kittens to your breast. Purring in reply, your cubs snuggle up to your exposed chest and gratefully cup their own sizable muzzles to your [Breast size desc of Player] breasts as they drink in your tainted knowledge and experience. 'Ah, you all look so cute like this, I can't wait to share this with your brothers and sisters one day,' Kathy murmurs, eyeing her own growing brood with an odd expectant smirk.";

Only the desire to care and provide for your young holds any true meaning or place in mind, as you encouragingly pet your hungry little adorable forms. You can sense on some level your strain reacting to this potent need, as your breasts swell in tune with your kitten's demands. Fresh sensitive nerves and flush supple adipose, simmer along your fecund figure. Beyond accustomed to such changes, your tainted mind welcomes this pleasurable padding as all around you, your brood mews in appreciation of their mother's endless bounty as desperately suckle your [Breast size desc of Player] in the attempt to quench their thirst. Eventually though, your form seems to have hit the usual wall as the growth levels out, leaving you feeling a touch cheated.

'And rich! Mh, I don't think I can drink another drop,' a second chuffs, fondly massaging her stomach with her tendrils. 'Gosh, you're smart mom, I never would have guessed half this stuff in a billion years,' a third stammers in awe, as she fixes you with a look of profound pride, while the others simply cuddle up next to you in a show of familial feline affection. Glowing under their earnest heartfelt praise, you thank them for their loving word, before offering them one last gift. 'What's that mom? Your intellectually inclined child asks. Why, their names of course, you reply. 'Really?!' they cry in unison. Nodding, you shift your gaze to your nearest kitten, you decide to call her.";

Not that Drake seems to notice the brief look of concern on your face as he walks past you. His eye's set and jawed set in determined grimace as pulls almost half of the unprocessed kill behind him, as he seems utterly oblivious to your presence. Only the elated cry of Kathy and the kittens greeting the noble provider shakes his steely match towards the back of the compound.";

'Hey girls, I must of zoned out a bit there,' as he shakes head as if to clear it, 'We had a little run-in with some hyenas who thought they could take this bad boy off us,' he rumbles, giving the noose a tug. 'Lazy sh-' Drake hesitates as his citrine eyes drift toward your kittens. '*Ahem*,' he coughs, 'so-and-sos, I must still be on edge.' 'Oh that's alright dear,' Kathy beams, at the sight of her proud hunter, while she fans her tail in front of her. 'We're all grateful for you and Ava. Speaking of which, where is my sweet kitten?' the lovely lioness asks, with a note of earnest worry worming its way through her otherwise bright tone as she peers behind him. 'RIGHT HERE!' Ava shouts, from behind the wall separating the Chance from the wider world, as the outlines of her ear drift between the razor wire coiling about its edges. 'Sorry, one of the guardrails fell off the cart, and I had to tie it up before things fell out.'";

No, solid wooden cart, you correct yourself, catching sight of the pair of primitive wheels rolling behind her as she pulls the sizable contraption through the gate, stuffed to the gills with several bright blue barrels of water interspersed with multiple stacks of milk-crates full of various plants along with a few multi-colored bird eggs, all of which is held in place with a simple cord bow tied in the same manner as Ava's baby blanket. 'Ah, good job Ava. Might need to work on your knots though,' Drake comments, eyeing up the basic tie with a critical eye. 'Sure thing da- er, Drake,' Ava peeps as she unties her lower half from the crude rickshaw. 'Uh where should I put this?' she inquires, batting her tendrils towards the bundles of supplies, while gently rubbing out the creases in her fur. 'Leave it there for now, I have to process the deer before the parasites can get a chance to ruin the meat. When you get the chance though, can you wash the stuff off so we can pickle it?' he replies as he makes his way to the back of the compound with the buck in tow.";

You notice the poor girl's paws are caked in fresh dirt and her natural eyeliner seems just a tad darker. Her pelt too appears to have lost a bit of radiance, as a heavy coating of the gray-drown dust impregnating the area around the Last Chances clings to her fur like a waterlogged cloak. Briefly, you consider mentioning this, but as you observe the way your mate tries to hide her sullied paws from view, you realize she's quite aware of this.";

'Oh mommy it feels too good to get off my petes,' she whimpers, rotating her left forepaw in an effort to placate some of apparent stiffness in her joints, as her poor limb loudly creaks from the effort. 'I'll say, sweetie, sounds like you two had a rough time out there,' Kathy sympathizes in a genuinely caring tone as she eyes her tired adopted daughter's dusty fur. 'Ya...' your mate sighs, her ears furling slightly, 'but,' she adds her eyes brightening at the sight of her family seated around her, 'just seeing you guys makes the trip worth it. So, how were things while I was out?' 'Great mommy Ava! We spent most of the day cuddling with momma Kathy, then mommy [Name of Player] and gave us our names,' one of your daughters exclaims.";

'Thanks everyone, but now you're just making this next part harder,' she sniffles, as she stares in your direction. 'What do you mean mom?' a third kitten inquires, tilting her head to one side. 'Well, it's time for you girls to go live with your other mother. I was hoping we'd have more time but,' she croaks almost on the edge of crying. 'Hey, don't cry mom. We know, and besides we're looking forward to traveling with mommy [Name of Player] and meeting our sisters!' a fourth kitten exclaims, as she throws her arms around Ava and gives her a loving hug.

'Oh honey, don't talk like that. It's not that hard-' Ava begins but the chorus of children's voices drowns out her words as they proclaim their desire to pitch in just like their birth mother. For a moment, your mate looks like she's about to contest them but a tender look from Kathy quiets her protest. 'Alright, just stay safe and take care of mommy [Name of Player] for me,' Ava beams, bobbing her head in your direction. 'Sure thing mom,' the fifth kitten simpers as she casts her gaze towards her siblings. 'Now come on everyone, let's go meet the others and give our moms some space,' the fifth cub concludes in a commanding tone as she leads the others off to greet their kin.";

'I wish I could stay with you guys for a while, but I have to wash the produce for da-, I mean Drake. But when I'm done and have a chance to wash up,' she adds dusting off a section her pelt with a pat of her paws, '[Name of Player], maybe you could come see me in the garage for a little mommy time?' she swoons, pressing her paw about your middle.

Overjoyed at the sight of your little ones, you race over to greet them. You notice each appears to be hard at work scribbling away a large sheet of white paper with equally massive black quills. Tucked next to each of your kittens are some simple baby-blue paperback english and math primers that they seem to be copying from as jot they down the problems then attempt to solve. Curious and also just a tiny bit proud to see your family engaging in such scholastic activities despite all the chaos and distractions the modern world offers, you politely ask how their lessons are going. '[italic type]*SSS*[roman type] Hard,' Ava hisses, baring her fang at the page. Her eyes narrow to thin pinpricks as she taps the sharpened end of the quill along the margins.

'Agh! Who decided to change the way math worked?!!!' one of your kittens fumes, slamming her tail against the walk as she makes a similar mistake. Tutting, you paw up beside her and offer to help. 'No thanks, mommy [Name of Player], [if HP of Drake is 7]grandpa[else]Drake[end if] and well-,' she whines, biting her lip in frustration. 'I just don't understand this stupid human stuff, it so-so GAH! None of this makes any sense,' she raves, scratching her claws through her head hair in abject bewilderment before turning to face you with a sad look in her eyes. 'I'm just dumb aren't I mom?'

The book says it's for twelve and up.' she huffs, tilting her head in confusion while her tail swishes behind like a broken metronome. Yes, twelve [italic type]years[roman type] and up, not hours or days, you answer in a loving tone, as you kneel down beside her and offer to walk through a few problems with her. 'No thanks, [if HP of Drake is 7]grandpa [else]Drake[end if] already tried that but he just kept talking about excusing his dear aunt Sally,' she pouts, thumping her head against the walkway in abject frustration. Saddened by the sight, you gently pet her on the back, informing her you're going to show her a special trick of your own that might help. 'Really?

A part can't help but swoon at the feeling of affectionate connection her touch brings as despite the respectable number of children you've sired with Ava. Some section of your feminine psyche is still adapting to the reality these children are yours despite the fact you weren't the one to carry them to term.

They hardly even stop to check their work, not that they need to, every one of their answers is correct.

A part is slightly saddened by this individual flare, but you realize this is likely a result of their exposure to your own knowledge, or a desire to show their appreciation for your priceless gift.

Tittering you, tell her that it was nothing, and ask if they'd like to meet the rest of their family while you catch up with Ava. 'You bet!
