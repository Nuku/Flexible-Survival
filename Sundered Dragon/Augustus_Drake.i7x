Normally, this minor aberration would be beneath your notice, were it not for the siren's call of a still-standing billboard advertising the Last Chance, a motel, camping, and auto shop less than a quarter-mile away. Enticed by the prospect of higher-end salvage, you head off without a second thought towards the potential treasure trove of supplies. The trek itself is unusually quiet, almost too quiet in your opinion. The pronounced absence of life, nanite-altered or otherwise, in the immediate area raises a few alarm bells in your head. Coming upon the outskirts of a large walled compound, you quickly find out why.";
	say "     The ground here is cracked and pitted with hundreds of thumb-sized holes, the edges encrusted with flakes of vermilion dust and sun-bleached bone. The traditionally all encompassing gold and green grasses which overrun much of the plains have been beaten back, not by hand, but by flame. Carbon scoring is rampant and the deadened soil is slowly being blown away revealing twisted gnarled roots eating the rusted remains of sewer lines like maggots feasting on the carcass of the world that was. The breeze itself is impregnated with a weak chemical tang that sticks to the back of your throat no matter how many times you try to clear it. Getting closer to the complex, you see its walls are covered in claw marks as if someone or something attempted to climb them.";

Standing on your toes, you spot what could at best be charitably described as a pill-box squats atop the roof of what you surmise is the hotel proper. Built from scavenged wood, reclaimed metal, and draped in a beat-up cargo net you doubt the thing could stand up to anything stronger than heavy breeze. Squinting, you spy the vague outline of a lone humanoid sniper. Their weapon already drawing a bead on your chest is set up therein. You wonder why they haven't taken a shot, perhaps they were waiting for you to enter earshot, or maybe they're sizing you up.";
	say "     Once your gazes meet, the marksman yells in a cold commanding masculine tone that seems used to giving orders and being obeyed. 'Drop to your knees and hands behind your head, mutant, unless you want me to paint the black top a fresh coat of brain matter gray.' As they flip on an attached laser sight that locks on to your nasal arch as if to drive home the point that they have you zeroed. Having no choice but to comply, you doubt you could survive a bullet in the head. Sure the nanites [italic type]might[roman type] pull you back together but you'd rather not play that game so, you do as the gunner instructs, for now. 'Smart choice, stranger, now what in the hell do you want!?' The rifleman demands. Feeling it would be better to be relatively honest with them. You inform them of the signage you spotted a ways back and how you thought you might do a bit of trading at the Last Chance. A technically true statement, as long as you replace the word trade with. Looting everything that isn't nailed down like you're taking part";

'Hm, alright then, if that's the case maybe we can work something out. Come on, get up and head round front, I'll let you in. But try anything funny-,' the fellow taps their rifle. Assuring them you mean no harm and are merely here to do some trading, you proceed, under the watch to the entrance of the Last Chance. The aperture proper, a heavy steel bar gate, is pitted in claw marks and is wrapped in several dozen padlocks and chains and is fortified by a one-foot thick cement wall. On the other side, you see the gunner, their heavy black bolt-action rifle slung over their shoulder, sliding down a workman's ladder propped up against the side of their perch.";
	say "     Able to get a better look at the other, you note that they are about six foot six inches tall, an impressively-built humanoid dressed in a white T-shirt, jeans, and black sneakers. Their skin, a rich tan olive, is complemented by well-kept black hair that shines like it was dipped in oil. He, judging from the absence of breasts upon his carved chest, robust Adam's apple, and noticeable bulge in his pants, appears purely male. At first glance, the man looks completely human, but as he strides over in an almost mechanical fashion to unlock the gate, you note the fellow's sharp almond eyes are slitted much like a hunting cat's. Sliding the gate back he says, 'Sorry about the tough talk kid, but with things the way they are right now, I can't afford to be too careful,' nodding for you to enter. 'Oh, the name's Augustus Drake by the way. Most people call me Drake though,' he continues, shutting the gate.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     While he works, you take the opportunity to look the burg over. Given what you can see, the Last Chance seems to consist of several buildings divided by a spacious parking lot. One, a 1950s style two-story-tall hotel, its walls painted a weather-worn mellow beige, is situated to the north. To the west is a wooden walkway framed by a garden of various California poppies with some kind of bronze maker at its core. In the eastern section is a small wilderness supply outlet joined with a mechanic shop. No doubt intended as a lure for ill-prepared vacationers who forgot to pack their hiking boots or unlucky truckers stuck out in the boonies. However, your sightseeing is brought to an abrupt end as Drake finishes sealing up the area saying, 'Come on kid let's talk in the lobby,' and walks off without listening for a reply. Deciding to follow along for the moment at least, you fall in step with Drake as he leads you to the motel.";

Standing at roughly six foot six Drake is quite the tall fellow with a decent build. His masculine body is sculpted in tough compact muscles and his tight cut ass could teach diamonds a thing or two about hardness. He wears a sun-faded white T-shirt and blue jeans that look a little tight on him. Strapped to Drake's back is a giant sniper rifle almost as big as he is with a popular quote from the Bhagavad-Gita: [italic type]Now, I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,[roman type] etched in a spiral pattern on the barrel. You recognize it as an anti-material rifle. If you recall correctly, a single depleted Uranium round fired from that thing is purportedly able to pierce the engine block of an APC. Currently, he could almost pass for an unaltered human were it not for his vertical pupils that are eerily similar to those of a predatory cat's or his odd earthen musk.";
	else if HP of Augustus Drake is 99:
		say "     Forcefully stripped of his humanity, due in large part to your meddling, Drake has transformed into a patriarchal lion. Initially a tall man, Augustus's infection has imbued him with an extra six inches putting the man at a towering seven feet. After being warped by the nanites you indirectly infected him with, Drake's impassive face has taken on the hardened boxy muzzle and dark blunted nose of a feral male lion. Adding to the effect is a mane of liquid bronze fur growing from around his neck. The ends of which appear to have a ring of flowing crimson highlights circumscribing his mane. His torso, humanoid in shape and covered in a pelt of burnished gold, has become a dense sea of finely hewed muscles you could lecture an anatomy class on. Altered by the infection, Drake's digits have become an efficient hybrid of leonine paws and sapiens hands. That allows him the benefit of his long retractable claws; while preserving his ability to operate sensitive equipment.";
		say "     Much in the order of his mane, Drake's fingers and toes are tipped with bright sanguine hairs. Sprouting from his chiseled ass is a long Felidae tail, which just like his digits ends in a tuft of rich blood red fur. Resting upon Drake's carved digitigrade legs is a plump pair of cantaloupe sized furry balls that hang close to his knees. In contrast, his meaty feline sheath appears to be around two inches thick and less than three inches long. As he's no longer able to fit into most pre-infection attire, Augustus has to walk about in the nude. The sole exception being a wrap-around holster he wears around his chest that at the moment is playing host to a large pocket knife. Hoisted over Drake's shoulder is his Anti-material rifle, the words: [italic type]Now, I am become death, the destroyer of worlds[roman type] coiling around the barrel.";

'Good, here's the deal. I pretty much set here on food, water, and materials but I'm a bit short on medical supplies. Well, I got tons of painkillers, but no sterile equipment. Normally, I'd go scaving some myself but can't leave this place alone long enough to go searching right now.

He gestures to the parking lot. 'We don't get much sane company out here, and I'm sure the two of them would love to hear what's going on in the city these days. Course, if you mess with either of the girls. The nanite infection will be the least of your worries.'

We avoided the brunt of the infected by staying inside the walls and going dark. Unfortunately, people weren't too keen on staying put and decided to run the blockade even though I offered them free room and board.' Drake nods his head in the general direction of the quarantine line. 'They didn't get far before the ferals caught on. I'll spare you the sorted details on what happened next. But suffice to say the military didn't exactly take too kindly to a column of horny mutants so close to their position and shelled the lot of them to kingdom come.'";

Hell, I'm pretty sure they didn't even bring flash bangs. No wait,' Drake grumbles his face contorted into a foul grimace as if he just bit into a block of pure Denatonium.

On the plus side, I looted this beauty from an overturned A.P.C,' Drake says, baring his teeth like a beast stalking his prey as he hoists the Anti-material rifle. 'Can you believe those guys never took this thing out of its case? Ugh,' Drake rubs his forehead, 'my head hurts just thinking about it.

In exchange, they gave me some supplies and watched over The Chance while I'd go carry out deep raids into the heart of the zone of alienation, er I mean city. And well on the way back from my last trip I was answering the old call of the wild, when this fucking Manticore flies into me from behind.'

'So, when the fucker was lining himself up I tore my left hand free from its grasp, pulled out my knife and slashed up the bastard's legs. Didn't do much but once I landed a solid jab on the critter's paw,' Drake pantomimes a quick stabbing motion, 'the blighter finally loosened its grip enough to give me the chance to struggle out from under it. Asshole was persistent and all, I will give him that. Even with a banged foot and a couple of broken ribs, he still tried to rape me.

Electing to put him at ease you regale Drake about your encounter with Medea. Telling him how many of the items he requested won't be necessary due to the nanite plague. 'Really,' he says, shifting through the package. 'Well I guess. I sort of suspected as much so I'll have to take this,' Drake pulls out Medea's card, 'Doctor Medea, huh. Guess someone's parents liked Jason and the Argonauts, at their word.' Drake getting up from behind the counter.";
		say "     '*Huff* still you did right by me and mine, so let me give something a little more valuable than food or water. Just need a second to get it out of the storage,' He says, extracting a five-inch-in-diameter keyring from his desk. Selecting one with red tape wrapped around it from the overflowing keyring, Drake unlocks the storeroom and heads on in, shutting the door behind himself before you can get a look inside. A minute or two passes before he returns carrying a battered medium sized black plastic suitcase not unlike those used by the military or a P.M.C. Placing the container on the counter, Drake undoes a number of hidden pressure latches. He flips the case open and slides it over to you. Looking inside of the case, you see a deconstructed short barrel rifle, known in parlance as a Bullpup carbine slotted into blue foam cut outs. These weapons might not always have the range or stopping power of conventional full sized rifles like the rugged Kalashnikov or modern M series.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     They excel in close quarters or urban scenarios owing to their maneuverability and lightweight design. Given your situation where most combat happens at knife point, such a layout is probably among the ideal. Interestingly, as you examine the piece's innards a little more thoroughly, you notice a number of electronic components have been added in lieu of the normal firing mechanisms. Further, the weapon does not appear to accept magazines, belts, clips, or even individual rounds leading you to believe this gun may have a self contained source of ammunition. 'Beauty isn't it?' Drake says, pulling out the stock. A rather elegant yet ergonomic jet black thing engraved with a bald eagle posing atop the letters RSX. You nod in agreement asking where he got such a prize. 'Well I'm not sure if I told you this. But a couple of weeks ago a military convoy got fragged by the behemoths not too far from The Chance.'";
		say "     'There were no survivors but a lot of their gear was left mostly intact. This being among them,' Drake taps the stock. 'Now if you can give another minute or two I can put this together for ya.' Wondering why you'd need his help, you ask Drake if you could perhaps do it yourself. 'Do you have a good multi-tool, a pair of magnifying glasses, and read the manual; which by the way the table of contents is thicker than a feral sea dragon's thumb?' You tell him no. 'Then I think you'd best leave it to me. Now where are my work glasses,' Drake says rummaging through his desk. 'Dang,' Drake snaps his fingers, 'I must have left them upstairs. Come on,' he says, gesturing for you to follow him. Shrugging, you pick up the suitcase and fall instep with Augustus.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     On the way up though, you notice a slight laxity in Drake's demeanor. No longer do his shoulders appear rigid in the order of a Potsdam giant on inspection day. His stride once boarding on mechanical now has a bit of joyful swagger to it. Even his stern expression is lost. Reaching Kathy's door, Drake smiles perhaps for the first time since you've met him as he knocks on her door. 'Sweetie, I'm coming in,' he says, letting himself in. 'Drakey!' Kathy her arms open wide and exclaims as you walk in after him. 'Hey honey,' Drake says, hugging his mate, and nuzzling the side of her head with his own. 'I am sorry to bother you about this, but have you seen my magnifying glasses?' 'Oh, that's right I forgot to tell you,' Kathy replies as she disentangles herself from Drake.";
		say "     'I was trying them on last night, don't worry though.' Kathy says rolling onto her tummy using her overripe womb as pillow and giving you a wonderful view of plush ebony snatch and thick padded ass as she reaches for the nearby nightstand. 'I put them in here when I was done.' Kathy says plopping down on her tush and sending a quick ripple through her lush figure, she pulls out a stubby pair of spectacles not all that dissimilar to those stereotypically worn by librarians. 'By the way, how do I look?' She asks, adoring the eye wear, which you have to say doesn't look all that bad on the portly lioness. Even if they do not rest on her head exactly as they were intended.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Hm, you know, I didn't think it was possible but you may have actually found a way to look even cuter.' Drake says, rubbing his chin as if to make a show of his inspection. 'Course now I feel bad about asking for them back.' 'Flatterer,' Kathy teases, handing Drake his glasses. 'Thanks sweetie, you know when I am done we could-,' Augustus whispers to Kathy as he kisses the nape of her neck. 'Ooh, I'll have to get out the mini-skirt and the yardstick then,' Kathy cuffs, running her fingers through Drake's mane. 'But could you take care of them first, I don't do public shows anymore,' she says, gesturing to you. 'Oh right,' Augustus chuffs. 'Hey kid, you mind setting that thing down on the table while I get out my tool.' Drake says over his shoulder as he pokes through the nightstands. Grunting, you do as he requests then prop your back against the door frame.";
		say "     Locating his folded multi-tool, Drake takes a seat, removing what you guess is the trigger assembly and barrel from the suitcase. 'Alright-y, this shouldn't be more than a spell,' he says, putting on his glasses. 'Now let's see, according to the manual I have to connect these wires to this thing here,' he says expertly coiling the tips of several wires together around a threaded anode diode. 'Then trim the excess then adjust the screws a half turn, clear off any dust or shavings-,' Drake murmurs slowly assembling the carbine. A rather idiosyncratic task you realize watching him make hundreds of tiny adjustments, muttering at the same time about magnetic saturation, scram rail alignment, and heat dispersion. Perhaps curious as to what he's building, Kathy waddles over to Drake's side saying, 'What's this thing?'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'My guess, it's a gauss gun sort of like the ones my roommate in college was working on,' Drake says, rapping the handle with the nail of his left middle finger. 'What's gauze? Is that the stuff you used to clean my cuts?' Kathy inquires. 'Sorry it's a bit of a homonym-,'Drake replies. 'A what,' Kathy interrupts, cocking her head at an angle. 'It means two words that sound the same but have different meanings, I'll explain a bit more later when we go over your English packets later. But basically this thing,' Drake taps the barrel with a screwdriver, 'uses high powered magnets fueled by a Type III Vanometic powercell to sling sharp bits of metal really far, really fast. Kind of like the Brahmashira only without the need for black powder. Still, I wonder how they overcame the problem of rail degradation. If I recall correctly the things overheated once they went above neodymium strength magnets. I remember people were talking about using He-3 as a heatsink or thermal conduit, but that was before Texas had its helium shortage. Only other option was Deuterium or Tritium but production of those damn near stopped after a reactor meltdown in Japan tanked the market.' Drake says affixing the rifle's housing.";
		say "     'Oh. So why are you giving it to them?' Kathy says, nodding her head towards you. 'Well the kid did us a favor by finding those supplies you'll need-,' Drake replies only to be swiftly cut off. 'Wait, is this about the cubs again? I told you, they'll be fine.' Kathy giggles petting her belly fur. 'I know Kathy but,' Drake says, sounding a little solemn as he wraps an arm around her. 'If anything happened... I don't think I could live with myself. You were right though. I guess, I just need to hear it from a few people.' 'Oh Drake,' Kathy says, pulling herself next to him and giving him a playful nip in the nose. 'You get so cute when you're all angst-y.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Now who's the flatterer,' Augustus jokes, slapping the finishing touches on the carbine's casing. 'Still you,' Kathy says, rubbing her muzzle against his check as he completes the weapon. Getting up, Drake whispers something in Kathy's ear that makes her chuckle then saunter off to the other side of the room. 'Sorry for the wait kid, here let me give you a quick demo outside. I got a couple of makeshift targets in storage. I'll grab them, a few beers, some smokes, and we can plink at them for a bit,' he says, handing you the rifle. Accepting it, you allow Augustus to lead you out the door, only to hear Kathy say, 'Um, Drake I think I need a little help putting on this mini-skirt,' stopping him in his tracks.";
		say "     'Actually on second thought, maybe you should head out on your own to test your new gun. Ya, I think that'd be best. So uh good luck, you're an adult an['] all so don't shoot your foot off or anything, BYE!' Drake says pushing you all the way out onto the dry plains. Locking the gate behind you, he sprints back to room 020 like a desperate young man about to lose his V-card.

Aw, he shouldn't pout you promise you'll make him feel real good. You tease, sizing up the lion man's stern regal physique with an appraising gaze as you reach out to stroke his toned golden abs and well defined yum gutter with your dominant hand. Besides, he should enjoy the new bod. You mean, fuck damn, look at him! He could grind meat on these things. You swoon tracing the hardened ridges of his sternum. '*Ggrr* don't touch me there,' Drake snaps batting away wandering hand.";

You press yourself against his velvety pelt continuing to stroke his chiseled pecs with your non-dominant hand.

While with the other, you brazenly stroke his groin, teasing his lush sheath and heavy knee-knocking balls. 'Damn horny mutant, you want the D don't you,' Drake chuffs bemusedly as you cup his sizable feline package. What can you say, you're a connoisseur of fine things. The new tool is quite the improvement over that old boring one, doesn't he think? Just look at this freaking monster, he could make an Alpha Husky look like a fennec fox!

You gibe, pressing your body against his goliath wang as it slowly peeks its way out of its fuzzy sheath, till it's sandwiched between your sternums. 'This!' Drake roars, grabbing hold of your [bodytype of Player] back. Digging his claws in your [SkinName of Player] hide, he lifts you off the ground and slams you a bit too roughly against a barren strip of wall. Acting on the instincts burned into what's left of your humanity over countless eons of evolution you struggle albeit meekly in his predatory look and grasp but the lion man's left paw shoots out seizing hold of your wrists.";

Only to be cut off as Drake roars, stretching his jaw to his chest as he bites at your throat. Fear tinged with an odd excitement course though you like an unstable plasma globe as Drake's dagger-like fangs and steamy hot breath encircle your vital arteries. Shooting you a baneful sideways glare he rumbles in a slightly muffled tone, 'Enough! I'm getting sick of your damn voice. If you want this monster so damn bad, fine.

'I'd prefer not to break beautiful things after all.' Drake remarks, eyeing up your [bodytype of player] body and the beautiful [breast size desc of Player] adoring your glistening chest.

Bigger is better after all, you tell him. 'You know. I hate to say it, but I like the way you think. Besides, it might give your naughty little ass something to do and out of my hair for a while,' Drake replies as he steadies his grip on your [bodytype of Player] hips.

A part of you can't help but nuzzle your [FaceName of player] face against the whipcord limb whilst his masculine scent titillates your senses. A lewder section of your warped psyche taunts your mind with the sudden urge to fellate the crimson tip of his bobbing tail as if it were an unattended dick waiting to be serviced.

You tease, sneaking a cheeky hand between the big cat legs giving his balls a fondle while your other continues tracing his sizable tool.'*Mrow* well if you insist, I hope you can handle it!'

Your frayed nerves struggle to transmit the sensations of Drake's sensuous spines lavishing your silken passage as your body clenches down on that wonderful kitty cock. You can dimly see the same bestial bliss on muzzle as his body reaches its limits and finishes with deep powerful roar that building and vibrates in your chest as a deluge of warm creamy floods your waiting petals. At once, you can feel the sheer weight and force of his eruption painting your insides with mutant seed.

Soon though post nut clarity kicks in as Drake's demeanor hardens and his dick softens, you feel the tension in his body rises as his rational half reasserts itself alongside the memories of what you've done to him. As they say: A man forgets but he never forgives. A woman forgives but she never forgets. Best to quickly disentangle yourself despite the warm bubbly feeling in your breast crying out for you to linger just a second longer.

As you ease yourself between his muscular thighs, your senses are at once assaulted by his heady feline musk. Your mouth waters and stomach rumbles while you shamelessly huff his virile scent.

Yet from the eager look on Drake's feral feline visage, you can tell it's quite the opposite. For all his continuing bluster about hating his new form, you can tell on some level he's still enjoying the new tool along with all its accessories. Who could blame him either, it probably feels out of this world to have those delectable barbs teasing his fluffy sheath, you muse. As your hands tease his exotic barbs and bloated sack, Drake chuffs, 'Heh, looks like someone's enjoying themselves,' rubbing his stern felinoid chin as he watches you coax his pre-drooling cock to full mast. Shooting him a sultry look, you purr in the affirmative telling him you're quite pleased with your handy work.";

'Goddamn furry, I still can't believe you like this weird dick. This thing looks like the devil's pipe clear,' Drake grumbles half heartedly. His tone is a bit softer than before. Tutting at him, you teasingly tell him he should be proud of his new anatomy. Most men would kill for a meat tube this big after all whilst you lazily lap at the tips of his crimson spines.

Naughty boi, you thought as much, you reply, tutting at him in a lustful trill as your lips engulf the tapered tip of his feline member. You revel in the rich salty and tangy flavor of his naturally lubed tool as you go down his foot-plus long cock. You can feel your cheek bulge and throat widen as your nanite altered maw attempts to accommodate his barbed turgid meat spear. Not for first you're a little grateful for the nanites assistance when it comes to dealing with above average mutants as you sense Drake's exotic tool brushing past the base of your tonsils. Your body seems to loosen itself around your partner enough to just barely fit. 'Damn you're just the right kind of tight.'";

Like I'm wearing your cute little mug,' Drake remarks as you slowly pistons your [FaceName of player] head along the length of his pringles-can-sized tool as best your [FaceName of player] mouth can manage. You revel in the sensation of his delectable flavor and tender barbs massaging your nanite-twisted palate. Whilst your dominant hand cups and fondles Drake's silken package like a bag of prized gems, your non-dominant explores the virile mutant's muscular thighs and chiseled abs, exalting in the wonderful dissonance of his smooth voluminous golden pelt and hardened core. The big cat rumbles enthusiastically at this treatment. He sneakily coils his long fuzzy tail about your neck like a living collar.

Never enough to hurt but enough to provide the large felinoid with a thrill as you practically brush your [FaceName of player] teeth with his fleshy spines. 'Ah, faster!' Drake roars, tightening his clawed grip on the back of your [FaceName of player] skull almost to the point of being painful as he presses down on you forcing his sizable dick down your throat. You almost choke and gag as his heft rod presses against your larynx, but you've gotten quite used to such treatment in recent days and take the abuse in a remarkable stride. Fixing him a needy look, you give Drake a happy throaty rumble vibrating the muscles of your well-used throat along the length of his shaft as you struggle to keep pace with your partner's desire. 'Fuck and I thought Kathy's muzzle felt amazing!' Drake chuffs as his barbed meaty throbs along your soft tissue.";

Still your malleable mandible struggles to accommodate Drake as his hilt brushes your nose and exciting your senses with the masculine scent of his abs, but there's only so much you can take. Yet, you remain undaunted, gliding your tongue along girth fellating his exotic cock while you dip a few fingers between your legs as your neglected nethers cry out for attention. You waste no time with meager foreplay you find yourself jilling your stiff bitch button between your thumb forefinger.

The air echoes with the vigorous wet squelching sounds of your performance until neither of you can hold back any longer. With a feral roar that reverberates through your being, the big cat cums. He tightens his hold on you wrapping his claws feet around you while pressing your head to his furry groin, blasting torrents of hot thick seed down your eager throat as he climaxes. You feel your body swell with his load as your belly groans and sloshes with his offering as it struggles to contain his virile gift. A part wants to gag or pull away but Drake's grip is too firm, his claws too sharp and your hunger too great to resist as you're forced to swallow each drop, your stomach bulging in a warm firm dome. By the time he's done, Drake pushes you like a used toy throwing you off balance.";

Sympathy appears to win out though as he says, 'Here move your hand, let me help you with that,' and hops off the counter. Licking his lips, the patriarchal lion kneels beside and lowers his muzzle between your legs. You make no move to stop the man as his hot breath washes over your sex. If anything, a part of you is excited by the prospect of being eaten out by the big cat even if you can't see him past your swollen stomach at the moment. Not that it matters to Drake as his padded paw hand wraps about your thighs, you can feel him lifting your lower body off the ground and forcing you on your back. He kisses your eager lips, with his boxy feline muzzle. You don't even mind when his cold blunt nose bruises your cum stuffed tummy while his long flat spiny tongue lavishes your joy buzzer with long drawn out licks.";

In fact you swear you can almost hear him purr at your touch, though you know he would never admit to it. Still the unsubtle vibrations are almost perfectly tuned to make for the most welcome exotic massage to your steamy sex while he nurses your clit with his tongue. You can feel your body tense up in anticipation as Drake explores your button. As each lap of his tongue sends tingles up the base spine like erotic static that fogs your mind that seems to hold you in thrall. You try desperately to hold out as long though as you can but your pre-warmed motor is already humming. It's all you can do to simply ride each blissful wave roiling through your body like the churning waters of a storm-wracked sea. Until at last your body taps out and you cry out like a sated beast as you finish squirting a load of feminine fluids in Drake's predatory maw.";
	say "     A part of you wants to apologize for not warning him, but the words die on your lips as he withdraws his head from your loins happily licking his muzzle clean. You get the feeling he doesn't mind too much. The large feline even goes so far as to offer you his hand and pull you to your feet before hopping back behind the counter top with a pleased look on his face. You feel like you should say something to him, perhaps even thank him but think better of it. You can already see his stern demeanor creeping over him again as his more rational (and irritated) side reasserts itself. After all, you tell yourself, sometimes it's best to let sleeping cats lie.";

'Don't call me that,' Drake growls in a deep throaty rumble that echoes in his chest as he angles himself behind your animalist hind end. 'Only Kathy and the kittens can call me that. Not YOU or anyone else.' He says, digging his claws into flanks for emphasis.";

'Better,' Drake snaps, withdrawing a hand to stroke his plump golden sheath as he eyes up your [cunt size desc of player] snatch. 'Now be a useful piece of meat and put on a good show in case the girl's walk by. They've been wanting to see what this beastly body can do to you, so don't disappoint. Oh,' Drake adds as his heft meat spear inches its way out of hiding, 'Just a reminder, if you get knocked up. The kids are your problem, not mine. I don't want any of your feral mutts to know it was me who sired them, we clear?' You nod, telling him your lips are sealed. 'Good, glad we understand one another for once.'

Drake comments drumming his clawed finger along the inner thigh of your rear legs. 'I bet taurs like you make great cum dumpsters. Must be why you gave up your humanity, to be the best cock sock in town. Can't say I blame you. It must be easy to be a slutty breeding bitch with a body like this.' Drake growls, pistoning his toned hips with enough force to press your upper half against the glass till all your breasts are mashing against the transparent surface. You can't say why but something about his rough treatment has you moaning happily over the sounds of your [SkinName of Player] hide squawking against the glass.";

Besides, you can carry my scent out there as you waddle around the city. You can let everyone know who the biggest man on plains is! I bet you'd love that wouldn't you?' Drake simpers. Yes, you trill, delighting in the exotic interplay of Drake blade-like claws skimming your hide and his soft fleshy spines teasing your muff in ways no human ever could. Your display earns you a low chuff from Drake in amusement at your debasement as he tail wraps around your left hind leg.

I wonder how many of the mutants you've whelped are out there right now causing chaos. I wonder if it's tens, dozens, hundreds. You've certainly got the capacity for it,' Drake jeer caressing you under belly with his soft paw pads. 'Hopefully this batch of little ones can help keep things stable and undo some of the damage you've caused. Who knows you might even make a few little lion taurs. Besides I bet Kathy and Ava would enjoy the sight of you waddling around with a belly full of kittens.'";

As she rounds the bend, a devious smile creeps across her muzzle as catches sight of you two mid coitus. No doubt amused by the spectacle of a tauress being pinned to the reinforced glass window like a cheap whore at a peep show. The lush lioness regards the pair of you with unabashed mirth as she says in a playfully sarcastic tone. 'Oh I didn't know a show was scheduled for today. Drake could you be a dear and hold that pose a moment. I seem to have forgotten my seat.' 'Oh course hun,' Drake chuffs in a loving trill. He then leans over to you and rumbles commandingly in a voice just barely below hearing. 'You heard her,' pressing his claws into your flanks and soft underbelly as Kathy runs upstairs. Nodding, you do as you're told and lock yourself in place despite any indignation you may feel as she vanishes.";

After smoothing a few creases, the gravid cat girl seats herself with her legs splayed open and with dramatic flourish of right hand says in a haughty tone. 'You may continue now.' 'Yes ma'am!' Drake snickers as resumes his rough treatment of your feral sex. The man holds nothing back, pounding your flank with all the force of a living gale. He slams your body against the tempered glass till the heat of your body mists the window in near perfect outline of your form. 'Mh, that's right honey fuck that cute piece of taur ass,' Kathy cheers watching your perky [breast size desc of Player] tits glide along window.";

She curls her tail under her taut cub swollen tummy teasing her leonine muff till her tail glistens with fem honey. Though she's not merely content to simply jill herself raw, the portly mother-to-be arches her fifth limb to more ergonomic angle to better bring her dexterous appendage to bear. Kathy slams her sizable sordid limb home. You're almost impressed by how much her body can handle as her sex effortlessly devours over a foot of well lubed tail. You can hear Drake rumble approvingly at her as she bucks her fecund body along the lengths of her sodden limb while her hands drift to her chest as she tweaks her stiff ebony teats between her thumb and pointer finger, coaxing out thick streams of cream from her tits. She eventually brings one to her lips with a hungry look in her eyes as she laps at leaking milk spouts before plopping it into her mouth. ";

It's more likely that she's simply doing it for her mate you surmise, listening to the sound of Drake's lustful panting as he watches her go. Stealing a glance behind you, you note his gaze locked on the sight of his horny lover as he abuses your sex like his own personal fleshlight. You can't deny that you aren't enjoying yourself either, each brutal thrust of his spiny spire sends delightful ripples through your animalistic body. A part of you swears you can almost sense each exotic barb innervating your fertile passage and throbbing button. The wonderful feeling mixes well with sensation of Drake's powerful paw like hands massaging your hindlegs and inner thighs stimulating the bestial nerves of your lower half.";

Say what you will about his demeanor, but the man knows his way around a tauress. That is to say nothing of the show Kathy is putting on for the two of you. It's almost hypnotic watching her voluptuous body jiggle as she tail-fucks her lush cunny and plays with her hopelessly engorged tits. Her whole body is a sea of bouncing maternal majesty as she rocks her hips in her creaking seat. Rivers of white stream down her tawny chest, and pool at her paws in a slowly growing creamy puddle. The big kitten doesn't seem to mind this in the slightest. If anything, she seems to be enjoying the brief relief as she pinches her stiff ebony nips basting her fur natural bounty. She massages some of the pearlescent fluid into fur like she was taking her own personal milk bath.";

You could be a lifeless breeding mount for all the man cares as he pounds your backside. His eyes are locked on his mate's bountiful body as his claws dig into your side. You know that you should feel indignant at being the semi-willing centerpiece of their little game, but a part of you can't deny a certain thrill either. Maybe it is the nanites' influence wreaking havoc on your inhibitions or perhaps it's simply the raw cunt-scrapping you're receiving. Regardless it doesn't diminish your enjoyment as your sex is ravaged by the big cat's onslaught. You feel your walls tighten and quake with each thrust as your satin depth milks your leonine partner's spiny member of all its worth.";

Even though warning bells blare in your ears, cautioning you against having such a predatory creature touch your soft lower body, you still swoon at the sensation of the tips of his claws caressing your vulnerable area. You find yourself panting lustfully as his strong, clawed hands rake the outline of your tauric passage. His pace never slows even as dick seems to twitch within you like a vibrator on its last legs. He still tries to hold, gritting his teeth as digs his fingers into your sides as if it would somehow stall things. Simple biology wins out in the end though as Drake bellows. 'Fuck I think I'm gonna, gonna-,' his words lost in a primal roar as a potent tremors pass through him as he climaxes.";

His thrusts get progressively weaker with each passing moment, yet the unusual sensation of his flesh spines and the warm seed pushes you over edge as well. Howling like a tauress possessed into the lobby window, you cry out as sweet relief floods senses like the purest of highs as the big cat's fresh offering of rich cum wallows delightfully in your well-used cunny alongside Drake's gradually softening rod as if you two were tied. The big cat makes no move to extricate himself either, equally content to let his cock retract back into its sheath. Still there is something special about the way the barbs caress your raw sex as they glide across your cum soaked nerves of your tauric clit.";
	say "     Enthralled by the sensation, you paw at your warm, thoroughly distended stomach nestled neatly between your legs. Oddly though, despite your stomach swaying well past your knees, you don't feel that encumbered by the sudden cumflation. You opine it must be one of the perks of being a taur, it's only natural you handle load with a tad more grace than some silly biped. If anything, you take a bit of pride in what your body can handle. You muse as you grope the fecund dome. Maybe it's the gallons of natural antidepressants sloshing around inside you or nanites fiddling with your brain, but a part of you is hoping Drake's swimmers stick. You can only imagine the adorable kitty hybrids you're sure to birth. Plus, you're sure you'd look sexy as hell with taut taur tummies on this body.";

Let my girl enjoy the afterglow, I know I am,' Kathy trills from outside as she packs up her now slightly damp chair. 'Yes dear,' Drake mumbles, looking a tad embarrassed as head outside to help her back up the stairs leaving alone to collect your things. By the time he comes back, you're all packed and the man hops back behind the counter waiting to see what you want next.";

Despite all the chaos and destruction of the nanite apocalypse, the plains still possess a natural albeit dissonant beauty to it. The golden grass swaying in the breeze, like a sea of rippling metal growing over human artifice, reminds you of famous semi-abandoned spaces like Centralia or some of the superfund sites in the states. Perhaps, The Last Chance will join them one day, another abandoned ruin cloaked in a vibrant green that belies its hostility towards human life. You muse, tilting your head letting the wind wash over you as in soak the vista and blood red peaks of Mt. Shirley off in the distance. Lost in your simple reverie, you don't even notice Drake scaling the ladder. His muffled steps are so akin to a light breeze upon a still moonlit pond, you don't even realize he's there till he's standing right behind. 'Enjoying the sights?' he quips, giving you a start as you whip about to face him, your arms raised ready for a fight.";
	say "     Locking eyes with him, you almost scream at him not to creep up on people like that. Drake merely shrugs in response saying, 'Eh, sorry [']bout that, it's a bit of a habit I picked up. It's a lot easier to deal with mutants if they don't know you're there.' You agree that that's true enough, but he should be a little more careful about who he sneaks up on in future. 'Fair, still you see anything interesting out there though?' You tell him no, but also ask why you don't see him up here more? The weather is nice, and the view is a heck of lot better than in some stuffy lobby. 'Well for starters, the girls don't like me smoking up here. They say the smell gets everywhere and irritates their noses.' Bobbing your head, you inquire about the other reason. 'I hate what I see up here nowadays.' Drake spits rather bluntly. Curious, you gesture for him to elaborate. 'Hmm,' Drake grumbles thoughtfully, tapping his chin, then unslings his rifle, 'I think it's easier to show ya.'";

'Here kid, take this, stand here,' Drake taps the roof with his boot, 'between the south and west flags, then look straight ahead,' Drake continues passing his rifle to you. Shrugging, you do as he instructs, taking the heavy weapon in hand. You march into position and bring the thing to the side of your face. You can still sense the lingering heat of his person and the conflicting scents of black powder and fragrant smoke coiling about the rifle. As you stare down the barrel, you're about to ask Drake what you should be looking for when the scope passes over two unaltered (to your eyes) Caucasians seated together by a poorly camouflaged tent couched in the ruins of a broken down concrete building.";

Casting a glance at Drake out of the corner of your eye, you ask him what's so special about two uninfected humans. 'They're not, well at least the man isn't. You can't see it right now, but he's got the beginnings of a centaur infection, it won't be long till he turns and probably tries to turn her.' Your interest piqued, you ask him how he knows this. 'I saw him make it with one of the fillies out there, it didn't affect him at first but everyday a little more hair spreads down his back. In a couple of days, I imagine he'll probably start growing a tail or something... then it's only a matter of time.' You tell him that that sounds horrible and that he should do something.

I've heard rumors of a sex slave operation run by a [']nightmare.['] Not sure what kind of nightmare though, could be the mythological, or the dream kind for all I know. Maybe these guys work for that thing, perhaps they're copycats,' he shrugs. 'Still, they've been shadowing those two for days.' Curious, you ask why they haven't attacked yet. 'Pure humans are rare, I think they know the guy is on borrowed time. If they pushed him he might turn quicker, or infect the lady. Seen it happen a few times in the field. [italic type]never a fun sight[roman type],' Drake says, though he whispers the part under his breath.

You can't save the man anyways, but there is always the chance he might not go feral when he turns. Who knows?

'Everyday since the outbreak started, I see stories like this play out, over and over. Sometimes it ends well, other times it doesn't. If I got involved with each one, shed a tear for everyone lost, I'd never get anything done.' Shrugging, you tell him so what, at least he'd be doing something not sitting around here like a miserly dragon squatting on its hoard. 'You're not wrong, if I wanted to.

'Here, take a look at the pictures, if you don't believe me,' Drake says, pulling out a very faded brown leather wallet. Flipping it open, he passes it over to you. As you inspect the collection of old cat photos wedged between a lifetime pass to Yosemite from something called: The Mountain Cat Preservation Association. You note much to your surprise, he wasn't lying. His old cat's fur and portly nature looked a lot like a tiny tubby lion. Curious as to her breed you ask Drake what kind of cat she was.

Beside him, are two other people. One is a shapely five foot six woman with long black who appears to be a mix of Polynesian and Greek descent covered in small bandage strips and old scars. She appears to be wearing low cut blue jean shorts, a black T-shirt, and brown leather sandals. Adjacent to her is a hefty person of Caucasian lineage.";

You honestly did not expect that given what you've seen in the city. 'What, did you think I rescued her because I wanted a horny cat-girl for a wife or something?' Well, she is knocked up with his kids, you reason but Drake talks over you, saying, 'Nah kid, she just reminded me of my old cat. Seeing her in trouble just brought back a lot of bad memories.

She has this amazing ability to cut to the heart of things and see past a lot of human B.S. Honestly, I'd love to introduce her to some of my old professors in the Anthropology department at U.C. Berkeley. They'd kill to hear some of the observations she'd made from behind bars. I just wish I could get her out of here soon. I don't know why, but I feel there is something in the air here making everything a bit too randy.' You ask Drake to elaborate what does he mean by [']something in the air['], is he referring to the nanites? 'I don't know, maybe.

Can you imagine what it must have been like for her to wander the city barely even a day old looking for the parents that abandoned her? The only creature's she could consider her 'people' calling her a freak just because she's a little different. I know it's probably a common story nowadays, so I shouldn't let it get to me. But when it's staring you in the face, begging for help, and just a little bit of love and understanding.' Drake pauses and casts a sad look at the garage.

Something about watching her learn, seeing her struggle with a problem, and being there for her in those moments things finally click. It makes me feel a bit better about the future,' Drake opines as he crosses his arm and stares briefly at the open sky. 'It's been good practice for when the kittens come due to. Ava might not know it, but she's really taught me a lot without even trying. No matter what happens, I will always be grateful to her for that gift.

Once you're there, Drake, his tank killer still trained on you, steps out of the pillbox at last revealing his new Felinoid form.

Looking at his extremities, you notice Drake's paws and the end of his tail also share this bizarre trait. As your gaze drifts south, you inadvertently get an eye full of Augustus's flaccid feline package. While his cock is nothing you would write home about (probably because he's not happy to see you).

Drake howls, thrusting his palm over your face, and pitches you over to the edge of the roof. As you hit the tile in a prone position, Augustus pads over you, hooking his rifle under your chin. 'But you know what,' Drake says, grinding the muzzle of his rifle against your throat. 'That's not what really pisses me off. What really makes me want to gut you is what you've done to my kids.' Confused, you ask what he means. 'Think about it for a second. Before you did this to me, I could have at least passed for a normal human. Sure, I might have needed contacts and some cologne, but now look at me,' Drake growls pointing at his feral visage.";

He croaks, like he's choking back on his own bile. 'But now, look at me!' He gestures again to his animalistic visage. 'I'm a walking Theseusian paradox! I don't even know if I'm still me, or if I'm just-just a hollowed out shell that's convinced itself it's Augustus Drake. It hasn't even been that long, and I'm already forgetting what I really look like. I stare at my old photos, and don't recognize the man that's looking back at me!' He bleats, clawing at his sternum with his talons. 'What gives you the right to do this to me? What makes you think that I, or anyone else would want to be with someone who does this to people!?'

'How is an [']I am sorry['] going to keep food on the table, or pay for my kids['] education?' Looking Drake hard in the eye, you tell him it won't. Nothing you say will, but becoming a murderer isn't going to help them either. 'Fuck,' Drake sighs lowering his anti-material rifle, 'get out of my sight.' Drake waves his rifle towards the gate.

"Drake's Blade"	"A modified Nahkampfmesser made during the first world war. This weapons has likely passed hands many times before winding up in the possession of Drake's family as it is composed from parts used by both Allied and Central Powers. The edge itself is obviously of sturdy German make though it is a little thinner one would expect as if someone had to buff out major dents on the fly. The handle appears to be made of a somewhat gamey piece of solid turned-wood likely from France if the style is anything to go by. While the crossguard and handguard taken from a MK. 1 trench knife has been crudely affixed to handle lending it an odd chimeric look. Unfortunately, after is stint in Old One Eye's noggin the thing has picked up some major funk that refuses to wash out."	2	Drake's Blade

"Driver Carbine"	"Rebuilt from stolen, eh [italic type]liberated[roman type], military ordnance, this short barrel weapon sports a bullpup stock composed of an unknown ultra lightweight black material. Emblazoned upon its grip is an effigy of a bald eagle perched atop a red, white, and blue kite shield bearing the letters RSX. A series of breaks have been built along the muzzle, given its lack of explosive propulsion you suspect it meant to help dispense heat. Below the barrel is a toggleable green laser designed to be visible in almost any lighting situation. Quizzically, no matter how many times you fire it, the carbine never runs out of ammo or experiences excessive heat build up."	8	Driver Carbine
