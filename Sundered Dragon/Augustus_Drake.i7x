	say "     Aimlessly journeying through the wild nanite enhanced grasses of the dry plains, you locate an unbroken stretch of road heading away from the city. Normally, this minor aberration would be beneath your notice, were it not for the siren's call of a still-standing billboard advertising the Last Chance, a motel, camping, and auto shop less than a quarter-mile away. Enticed by the prospect of higher-end salvage, you head off without a second thought towards the potential treasure trove of supplies. The trek itself is unusually quiet, almost too quiet in your opinion. The pronounced absence of life, nanite-altered or otherwise, in the immediate area raises a few alarm bells in your head. Coming upon the outskirts of a large walled compound, you quickly find out why.";
	say "     The ground here is cracked and pitted with hundreds of thumb-sized holes, the edges encrusted with flakes of vermilion dust and sun-bleached bone. The traditionally all encompassing gold and green grasses which overrun much of the plains have been beaten back, not by hand, but by flame. Carbon scoring is rampant and the deadened soil is slowly being blown away revealing twisted gnarled roots eating the rusted remains of sewer lines like maggots feasting on the carcass of the world that was. The breeze itself is impregnated with a weak chemical tang that sticks to the back of your throat no matter how many times you try to clear it. Getting closer to the complex, you see its walls are covered in claw marks as if someone or something attempted to climb them.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A fool's errand you note, observing multiple types of razor wire have been installed along the perimeter. Standing on your toes, you spot what could at best be charitably described as a pill-box squats atop the roof of what you surmise is the hotel proper. Built from scavenged wood, reclaimed metal, and draped in a beat-up cargo net you doubt the thing could stand up to anything stronger than heavy breeze. Squinting, you spy the vague outline of a lone humanoid sniper. Their weapon already drawing a bead on your chest is set up therein. You wonder why they haven't taken a shot, perhaps they were waiting for you to enter earshot, or maybe they're sizing you up.";
	say "     Once your gazes meet, the marksman yells in a cold commanding masculine tone that seems used to giving orders and being obeyed. 'Drop to your knees and hands behind your head, mutant, unless you want me to paint the black top a fresh coat of brain matter gray.' As they flip on an attached laser sight that locks on to your nasal arch as if to drive home the point that they have you zeroed. Having no choice but to comply, you doubt you could survive a bullet in the head. Sure the nanites [italic type]might[roman type] pull you back together but you'd rather not play that game so, you do as the gunner instructs, for now. 'Smart choice, stranger, now what in the hell do you want!?' The rifleman demands. Feeling it would be better to be relatively honest with them. You inform them of the signage you spotted a ways back and how you thought you might do a bit of trading at the Last Chance. A technically true statement, as long as you replace the word trade with. Looting everything that isn't nailed down like you're taking part";

'Hm, alright then, if that's the case maybe we can work something out. Come on, get up and head round front, I'll let you in. But try anything funny-,' the fellow taps their rifle. Assuring them you mean no harm and are merely here to do some trading, you proceed, under the watch to the entrance of the Last Chance. The aperture proper, a heavy steel bar gate, is pitted in claw marks and is wrapped in several dozen padlocks and chains and is fortified by a one-foot thick cement wall. On the other side, you see the gunner, their heavy black bolt-action rifle slung over their shoulder, sliding down a workman's ladder propped up against the side of their perch.";
	say "     Able to get a better look at the other, you note that they are about six foot six inches tall, an impressively-built humanoid dressed in a white T-shirt, jeans, and black sneakers. Their skin, a rich tan olive, is complemented by well-kept black hair that shines like it was dipped in oil. He, judging from the absence of breasts upon his carved chest, robust Adam's apple, and noticeable bulge in his pants, appears purely male. At first glance, the man looks completely human, but as he strides over in an almost mechanical fashion to unlock the gate, you note the fellow's sharp almond eyes are slitted much like a hunting cat's. Sliding the gate back he says, 'Sorry about the tough talk kid, but with things the way they are right now, I can't afford to be too careful,' nodding for you to enter. 'Oh, the name's Augustus Drake by the way. Most people call me Drake though,' he continues, shutting the gate.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     While he works, you take the opportunity to look the burg over. Given what you can see, the Last Chance seems to consist of several buildings divided by a spacious parking lot. One, a 1950s style two-story-tall hotel, its walls painted a weather-worn mellow beige, is situated to the north. To the west is a wooden walkway framed by a garden of various California poppies with some kind of bronze maker at its core. In the eastern section is a small wilderness supply outlet joined with a mechanic shop. No doubt intended as a lure for ill-prepared vacationers who forgot to pack their hiking boots or unlucky truckers stuck out in the boonies. However, your sightseeing is brought to an abrupt end as Drake finishes sealing up the area saying, 'Come on kid let's talk in the lobby,' and walks off without listening for a reply. Deciding to follow along for the moment at least, you fall in step with Drake as he leads you to the motel.";

Standing at roughly six foot six Drake is quite the tall fellow with a decent build. His masculine body is sculpted in tough compact muscles and his tight cut ass could teach diamonds a thing or two about hardness. He wears a sun-faded white T-shirt and blue jeans that look a little tight on him. Strapped to Drake's back is a giant sniper rifle almost as big as he is with a popular quote from the Bhagavad-Gita: [italic type]Now, I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,[roman type] etched in a spiral pattern on the barrel. You recognize it as an anti-material rifle. If you recall correctly, a single depleted Uranium round fired from that thing is purportedly able to pierce the engine block of an APC. Currently, he could almost pass for an unaltered human were it not for his vertical pupils that are eerily similar to those of a predatory cat's or his odd earthen musk.";

Initially a tall man, Augustus's infection has imbued him with an extra six inches putting the man at a towering seven feet. After being warped by the nanites you indirectly infected him with, Drake's impassive face has taken on the hardened boxy muzzle and dark blunted nose of a feral male lion. Adding to the effect is a mane of liquid bronze fur growing from around his neck. The ends of which appear to have a ring of flowing crimson highlights circumscribing his mane. His torso, humanoid in shape and covered in a pelt of burnished gold, has become a dense sea of finely hewed muscles you could lecture an anatomy class on. Altered by the infection, Drake's digits have become an efficient hybrid of leonine paws and sapiens hands. That allows him the benefit of his long retractable claws; while preserving his ability to operate sensitive equipment.";
		say "     Much in the order of his mane, Drake's fingers and toes are tipped with bright sanguine hairs. Sprouting from his chiseled ass is a long Felidae tail, which just like his digits ends in a tuft of rich blood red fur. Resting upon Drake's carved digitigrade legs is a plump pair of cantaloupe sized furry balls that hang close to his knees. In contrast, his meaty feline sheath appears to be around two inches thick and less than three inches long. As he's no longer able to fit into most pre-infection attire, Augustus has to walk about in the nude. The sole exception being a wrap-around holster he wears around his chest that at the moment is playing host to a large pocket knife. Hoisted over Drake's shoulder is his Anti-material rifle, the words: [italic type]Now, I am become death, the destroyer of worlds[roman type] coiling around the barrel.";

Tapping a bit of ash off the end he unabashedly sparks it up as he continues, saying. 'Now, you said you're looking to do a little trading right?' You reply in the affirmative. 'Good, here's the deal. I pretty much set here on food, water, and materials but I'm a bit short on medical supplies. Well, I got tons of painkillers, but no sterile equipment. Normally, I'd go scaving some myself but can't leave this place alone long enough to go searching right now.

He gestures to the parking lot. 'We don't get much sane company out here, and I'm sure the two of them would love to hear what's going on in the city these days. Course, if you mess with either of the girls. The nanite infection will be the least of your worries.'

Drake inquires in a somewhat indifferent tone as he gazes over your shoulder at a pair of dust devils swirling beyond the gate with a vaguely bored look on his face[if Perception of Player >= 25]. Despite his seemingly disinterested tenor, you notice a slight clench in his jawline. The man's feline eyes are sharp focused crescents reminiscent of a predator eyeing up its prey as he watches the motes of brown, gray, and black dust swirl behind you[end if]. Shrugging, you reply in the affirmative, the city isn't exactly swimming in supplies, and most survivors aren't exactly in a sharing mood either. '*Huff*, true, not a lot of folks willing to trade either. Can't say I blame them, it's a bit risky,' Drake grumbles through an odd, sharp, almost too-toothy scowl. Why does he say that, you ask. 'Well, sometimes the more stable muties will try to slip in an infectious item or two into whatever their trading. Seen it happen once in the field when an older woman named Jade I used to know who lived in old Victorian style house near the Red Light District.'";
			say "     'She was a short woman with beautiful rich raven black hair, soft violet eyes, skin the color of caramel cream, and smelled of exotic spices.' He says as his momentarily adopts a warm nostalgic tone, 'who bought a box of trash bags, tube of toothpaste, a hairbrush, and some rubber gloves from a Latex Vixen Herm from the RLD.' Drake nods his head in the general direction of the Red Light District. 'Don't know which one was infectious, but in hindsight, I suspect some, if not all of the plastic from those came from the vixen. Didn't take long for her to start changing, it was little things at first. Skin started looking a bit too smooth, hair became stiff and ridged, then she,' Drake winces as his left eye twitches almost imperceptibly at the memory. 'She started showing more than a bit of passing interest in mutants. At first, I thought it was just intellectual or medical curiosity. She was pretty damn smart, half the time I had no idea what she was talking about. But, I learned something new whenever we spoke, so I didn't think much of it.'";

I was pretty darn sure she was ace. Since my brother and I tried barking up that tree more than once in the past, and well,' he says, flashing a single far-too-sharp canine at you, 'nothing ever came of it. Eventually, during one of my visits, I ended up walking on her having some [']alone time[']. By then she... she was already transitioning into a full fledged Latex Vixen Herm, but the saddest part was, she seemed to enjoy playing with her new [']toy['] even as her mind started to slip away,' Drake continues in a tired almost ragged tone as his catty pupils shrink to the smallest of pin pricks.

Everywhere the stuff touched, her body started to writhe and contort into a parody of a fox. Then this smell hit me,' he winces, his nose twitching in revulsion, 'it was like holding your head over a cauldron of burning brakes, body soil, and ozone that made me want to gag. But the worst part was, she had this-this look on her face,' Drake shudders as he recalls the memory. 'It was like she knew what was happening to her, yet couldn't, or wouldn't stop, it just felt too good she said.

'To be honest I got lucky, at the time of the outbreak I was already indoors along with most of the staff and clientele. We avoided the brunt of the infected by staying inside the walls and going dark. Unfortunately, people weren't too keen on staying put and decided to run the blockade even though I offered them free room and board.' Drake nods his head in the general direction of the quarantine line. 'They didn't get far before the ferals caught on. I'll spare you the sorted details on what happened next. But suffice to say the military didn't exactly take too kindly to a column of horny mutants so close to their position and shelled the lot of them to kingdom come.'";

Too many fliers think they are toys, challenges or something I guess, but the bloody fools. They went out in light armor with almost no heavy weapons, chem suits, tank support, or explosives. Hell, I'm pretty sure they didn't even bring flash bangs. No wait,' Drake grumbles his face contorted into a foul grimace as if he just bit into a block of pure Denatonium. 'I take that back, they had one grenade, each. I have no idea why though. I mean what in the heck is one M67 grenade gonna do against say a wyvern other than piss it off?' So what happened to them, you ask.";

When all was finally said and done, I went out looking for survivors, as you can guess there weren't any. On the plus side, I looted this beauty from an overturned A.P.C,' Drake says, baring his teeth like a beast stalking his prey as he hoists the Anti-material rifle. 'Can you believe those guys never took this thing out of its case? Ugh,' Drake rubs his forehead, 'my head hurts just thinking about it. Aside from the Brahmashira here,' Drake points to his rifle, 'I pulled out a few dozen boxes of ammo .50 Cal., sandbags, bits of gear.

In exchange, they gave me some supplies and watched over The Chance while I'd go carry out deep raids into the heart of the zone of alienation, er I mean city. And well on the way back from my last trip I was answering the old call of the wild, when this fucking Manticore flies into me from behind.' Drake holds his right hand at a ninety degree angle; then glides his left hand to the palm of his right hand. 'No joke, the shit actually tried to mount me,' Drake audibly gags at the thought.";

Ah now that was good Deutsch Stahl from the Kaiser Reich, not like this piece of junk pot metal from China I am using now.' Drake pulls his shirt collar away from his neck, displaying a black nylon knife holster playing host to a cheap pocket knife strapped around his chest. 'So, when the fucker was lining himself up I tore my left hand free from its grasp, pulled out my knife and slashed up the bastard's legs. Didn't do much but once I landed a solid jab on the critter's paw,' Drake pantomimes a quick stabbing motion, 'the blighter finally loosened its grip enough to give me the chance to struggle out from under it. Asshole was persistent and all, I will give him that. Even with a banged foot and a couple of broken ribs, he still tried to rape me. Almost succeeded when he got a few stings in with his tail,' Drake involuntarily winces and rubs his shoulder, 'until I gouged out his eye. ";

You see, not long after everyone with a working car, or the ability to steal one.' Drake grumbles rolling his eyes, 'tried to flee the outbreak, a group of teens from the local college showed up begging for shelter. I let them in, but I forgot to search them, or their stuff first. Stupid old fool,' Drake mutters, knuckling his brow. 'I guess one of them may have drunk tainted water or fiddled with an infectious doodad at some point, and kept their mutation secret.'";

'Still, things worked out for a time at least. I got to run deep raids for a bit, gather up supplies, fortified the Chance with their help, meet other survivors, even ran with a sane mutie or two.

[']Bout time they did something useful right? Still I was out of commission for about a day. Course, when I limped back to the chance I found the teens had gone feral, tore up most of the rooms, and skipped town, uh metaphorically speaking. I'm pretty sure most of them are with the Impala herds judging from the hoof prints. Still cleanup was a goddamn bitch, I ended up burning most of the furniture, carpets, shower curtains, even tore out a section of wall. I am not one hundred percent sure I got everything though. So for now, I am keeping them locked down till the C.D.C, F.E.M.A, the E.P.A, or better yet all three give me the all clear. That answer your question kid?'";

Aw, he shouldn't pout you promise you'll make him feel real good. You tease, sizing up the lion man's stern regal physique with an appraising gaze as you reach out to stroke his toned golden abs and well defined yum gutter with your dominant hand. Besides, he should enjoy the new bod. You mean, fuck damn, look at him! He could grind meat on these things. You swoon tracing the hardened ridges of his sternum.

While with the other, you brazenly stroke his groin, teasing his lush sheath and heavy knee-knocking balls. 'Damn horny mutant, you want the D don't you,' Drake chuffs bemusedly as you cup his sizable feline package. What can you say, you're a connoisseur of fine things.

Digging his claws in your [SkinName of Player] hide, he lifts you off the ground and slams you a bit too roughly against a barren strip of wall.

Only to be cut off as Drake roars, stretching his jaw to his chest as he bites at your throat. Fear tinged with an odd excitement course though you like an unstable plasma globe as Drake's dagger-like fangs and steamy hot breath encircle your vital arteries. Shooting you a baneful sideways glare he rumbles in a slightly muffled tone, 'Enough! I'm getting sick of your damn voice. If you want this monster so damn bad, fine.

Bigger is better after all, you tell him. 'You know. I hate to say it, but I like the way you think. Besides, it might give your naughty little ass something to do and out of my hair for a while,' Drake replies as he steadies his grip on your [bodytype of Player] hips.

You tease, sneaking a cheeky hand between the big cat legs giving his balls a fondle while your other continues tracing his sizable tool.'*Mrow* well if you insist, I hope you can handle it!'

Your frayed nerves struggle to transmit the sensations of Drake's sensuous spines lavishing your silken passage as your body clenches down on that wonderful kitty cock. You can dimly see the same bestial bliss on muzzle as his body reaches its limits and finishes with deep powerful roar that building and vibrates in your chest as a deluge of warm creamy floods your waiting petals. At once, you can feel the sheer weight and force of his eruption painting your insides with mutant seed. Your stomach stretches out in a firm sphere of cum bloated majesty, and your voice joins with his. You involuntarily bury your head in his chest golden floof to muffle your cry as you reach your own electric climax.";

Soon though post nut clarity kicks in as Drake's demeanor hardens and his dick softens, you feel the tension in his body rises as his rational half reasserts itself alongside the memories of what you've done to him. As they say: A man forgets but he never forgives. A woman forgives but she never forgets. Best to quickly disentangle yourself despite the warm bubbly feeling in your breast crying out for you to linger just a second longer.

Eyeing up his plump meaty sheath, golden knee-knocking nuts, and toned furry glutes you tell him you can live with that. As you ease yourself between his muscular thighs, your senses are at once assaulted by his heady feline musk. Your mouth waters and stomach rumbles while you shamelessly huff his virile scent.

With the other, you gently cup and caress Drake's heavy hand-filling baby-makers between your fingers like a sack of precious marbles.

Yet from the eager look on Drake's feral feline visage, you can tell it's quite the opposite. For all his continuing bluster about hating his new form, you can tell on some level he's still enjoying the new tool along with all its accessories. Who could blame him either, it probably feels out of this world to have those delectable barbs teasing his fluffy sheath, you muse. As your hands tease his exotic barbs and bloated sack, Drake chuffs, 'Heh, looks like someone's enjoying themselves,' rubbing his stern felinoid chin as he watches you coax his pre-drooling cock to full mast.

'Goddamn furry, I still can't believe you like this weird dick. This thing looks like the devil's pipe clear,' Drake grumbles half heartedly. His tone is a bit softer than before. Tutting at him, you teasingly tell him he should be proud of his new anatomy. Most men would kill for a meat tube this big after all whilst you lazily lap at the tips of his crimson spines.

You revel in the rich salty and tangy flavor of his naturally lubed tool as you go down his foot-plus long cock. You can feel your cheek bulge and throat widen as your nanite altered maw attempts to accommodate his barbed turgid meat spear. Not for first you're a little grateful for the nanites assistance when it comes to dealing with above average mutants as you sense Drake's exotic tool brushing past the base of your tonsils.

Purring demurely, the hunky lion man nods, and glides his padded hands along the equator of your distended lower half. Your pacified pet diligently pampers your lower half, drawing delectable soothing circles in your creaking tummy. He leans to give your swollen animalistic middle a tender rub with his whiskered cheeks and a few loving laps of his spined tongue along your sensitive skin that sends heady waves bestial bliss through your core.

Unwilling to let such a rare sensation, or a drop of the big cat's creamy load pass you by, you constrict your hungry cunt about his tapered tool coaxing the last drops of post-coital bliss from your fuck-numbed plaything's shrinking tool.

Loosing an almost catty purr, you rear up on your hindleg to show off your gracefully swollen animalistic half and better expose it to your kitty's loving touch.

Good, you inform your temporary toy as you give his regal mane a few playful pets with your forepaws, relishing the power that your exotic body has over him, before releasing your hold. You shove him to the floor like a used sex toy and disentangle yourself from him. Now clean yourself up, and maybe this lobby too, you command, gesturing to his fem-honey-soaked groin then the dirty carpet.

	say "     Walking along the edges of Drake's perch, you pause to take a moment and admire the view. Despite all the chaos and destruction of the nanite apocalypse, the plains still possess a natural albeit dissonant beauty to it. The golden grass swaying in the breeze, like a sea of rippling metal growing over human artifice, reminds you of famous semi-abandoned spaces like Centralia or some of the superfund sites in the states. Perhaps, The Last Chance will join them one day, another abandoned ruin cloaked in a vibrant green that belies its hostility towards human life. You muse, tilting your head letting the wind wash over you as in soak the vista and blood red peaks of Mt. Shirley off in the distance. Lost in your simple reverie, you don't even notice Drake scaling the ladder. His muffled steps are so akin to a light breeze upon a still moonlit pond, you don't even realize he's there till he's standing right behind. 'Enjoying the sights?' he quips, giving you a start as you whip about to face him, your arms raised ready for a fight.";
	say "     Locking eyes with him, you almost scream at him not to creep up on people like that. Drake merely shrugs in response saying, 'Eh, sorry [']bout that, it's a bit of a habit I picked up. It's a lot easier to deal with mutants if they don't know you're there.' You agree that that's true enough, but he should be a little more careful about who he sneaks up on in future. 'Fair, still you see anything interesting out there though?' You tell him no, but also ask why you don't see him up here more? The weather is nice, and the view is a heck of lot better than in some stuffy lobby. 'Well for starters, the girls don't like me smoking up here. They say the smell gets everywhere and irritates their noses.' Bobbing your head, you inquire about the other reason. 'I hate what I see up here nowadays.' Drake spits rather bluntly. Curious, you gesture for him to elaborate. 'Hmm,' Drake grumbles thoughtfully, tapping his chin, then unslings his rifle, 'I think it's easier to show ya.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'One sec,' he says bringing the scope to his eye. He scans the horizon looking for who knows what. Seconds pass before Drake finds what he is searching for, 'Tck, there they are,' Drake says, clicking his tongue as he lowers his weapon. 'Here kid, take this, stand here,' Drake taps the roof with his boot, 'between the south and west flags, then look straight ahead,' Drake continues passing his rifle to you. Shrugging, you do as he instructs, taking the heavy weapon in hand. You march into position and bring the thing to the side of your face. You can still sense the lingering heat of his person and the conflicting scents of black powder and fragrant smoke coiling about the rifle. As you stare down the barrel, you're about to ask Drake what you should be looking for when the scope passes over two unaltered (to your eyes) Caucasians seated together by a poorly camouflaged tent couched in the ruins of a broken down concrete building.";
	say "     One is a brown haired male dressed in jeans and black T-shirt, the other, a red headed female is wearing gray khakis and a low cut red shirt. Casting a glance at Drake out of the corner of your eye, you ask him what's so special about two uninfected humans. 'They're not, well at least the man isn't. You can't see it right now, but he's got the beginnings of a centaur infection, it won't be long till he turns and probably tries to turn her.' Your interest piqued, you ask him how he knows this. 'I saw him make it with one of the fillies out there, it didn't affect him at first but everyday a little more hair spreads down his back. In a couple of days, I imagine he'll probably start growing a tail or something... then it's only a matter of time.' You tell him that that sounds horrible and that he should do something. 'That's a shit idea, look in the overgrowth behind them, you'll see why,' Drake says, his pupils twitching and narrowing as he points to a patch of scrub brush ";

I've heard rumors of a sex slave operation run by a [']nightmare.['] Not sure what kind of nightmare though, could be the mythological, or the dream kind for all I know. Maybe these guys work for that thing, perhaps they're copycats,' he shrugs. 'Still, they've been shadowing those two for days.' Curious, you ask why they haven't attacked yet. 'Pure humans are rare, I think they know the guy is on borrowed time. If they pushed him he might turn quicker, or infect the lady. Seen it happen a few times in the field. [italic type]never a fun sight[roman type],' Drake says, though he whispers the part under his breath. 'Those things tend to be cowards too, they're afraid of centaurs and anything larger or vicious than them so they'll wait as long as they can. Course, if they think their game is threatened, they might find the balls to rush'em.";

With this gun you could easily take down the horse men, or at the very least definitely scatter them, as for the humans. Bullets wouldn't fix things in the long term. You can't save the man anyways, but there is always the chance he might not go feral when he turns. Who knows? The pair might even be happier as centaurs, and at least they'd have a better odds of surviving out here that way. The last option is to do nothing, and let cards fall where they may.

'No kid, I don't think so.'";

He extends his hand gesturing for you to return his gun. Groaning, you begrudgingly pass it back while asking what he means. 'Everyday since the outbreak started, I see stories like this play out, over and over. Sometimes it ends well, other times it doesn't. If I got involved with each one, shed a tear for everyone lost, I'd never get anything done.' Shrugging, you tell him so what, at least he'd be doing something not sitting around here like a miserly dragon squatting on its hoard. 'You're not wrong, if I wanted to. I could try forcing my own little version of law and my order over the plains. But that's not something I can sustain, physically or mentally. Once I run out of ammo, or piss off enough of the smarter mutants, I could easily be overrun.'";

Drake sighs. 'Shit this is getting depressing, I need a dab or maybe a drink, see you around kid, and don't fall off the roof now. My insurance premiums are high enough as it is,' he quips as he makes way back down the ladder. Before he can make it to the first rung though, you feel a question burning in the back of your mind and without meaning to, you ask, why? The simple, potent, yet vexing word stops Drake mid step as he looks at you queerly, saying, 'Why what?' Why, you ask, did he save Kathy, or take in Ava if he is so content to let sleeping dogs lie? 'Ya about that,' Drake inhales sharply and deeply.";
			say "     'She well... she looks a lot like an old cat, Miss Mittens.' Drake answers. Really, and that's the only reason why he saved her? No other reason, you respond, doing your best to suppress your bemusement. Drake bobs his head and gestures for you to wait as he fishes something out of his pants pockets. 'Here, take a look at the pictures, if you don't believe me,' Drake says, pulling out a very faded brown leather wallet. Flipping it open, he passes it over to you. As you inspect the collection of old cat photos wedged between a lifetime pass to Yosemite from something called: The Mountain Cat Preservation Association. You note much to your surprise, he wasn't lying. His old cat's fur and portly nature looked a lot like a tiny tubby lion. Curious as to her breed you ask Drake what kind of cat she was. Flipping through a few more photos, Drake tells you that unfortunately he doesn't know.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Much to his regret, his parents had the cat spayed when he was younger, and refused to get any genetic testing done. He realizes now it was because they suspected she was an exotic, and didn't want her taken away. He even points out a few features not seen on domestic cats in a few pics like the tufts on her ears, or her webbed toes that backs up his theory. You also realize from the dates written on the back of each picture that she was alive till 1995 as the last photo shows a slightly slimmer and somber looking Drake laying a bouquet of California Poppies laced together with purple Catmint flowers next to a hand painted wooden tombstone dated 1970-1995 surrounded by serpentine, beach glass, and garnet. Beside him, are two other people. One is a shapely five foot six woman with long black hair who appears to be a mix of Polynesian and Greek descent covered in small bandage strips and old scars. She appears to be wearing low cut blue jean shorts, a black T-shirt, and brown leather sandals. Adjacent to her is a hefty person of Caucasian lineage.";
			say "     You'd put them at about six feet tall with a shaved bald head dressed in black leather biker pants, a white long sleeve shirt, heavy black hiking boots, with a matching black leather button up jacket tied to their waist. Thanks to their size, and haircut you can't tell what gender they are though. Well, you stand corrected, and politely tell him as much. You honestly did not expect that given what you've seen in the city. 'What, did you think I rescued her because I wanted a horny cat-girl for a wife or something?' Well, she is knocked up with his kids, you reason but Drake talks over you, saying, 'Nah kid, she just reminded me of my old cat. Seeing her in trouble just brought back a lot of bad memories. That things have *ahem*,' Drake blushes, coughing into his hand, 'evolved from there is a different story. I don't expect you to believe me, but being with her makes me happier than I've ever been in years,' Drake beams.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'We can talk for hours, and it feels like Ol['] Blue Eyes is singing for us just for us. When we're apart the world feels so gray, quiet, and empty. And despite what you may think of her, Kathy is a lot smarter than she lets on. I think she could probably pass the G.E.D test soon. She has this amazing ability to cut to the heart of things and see past a lot of human B.S. Honestly, I'd love to introduce her to some of my old professors in the Anthropology department at U.C. Berkeley. They'd kill to hear some of the observations she'd made from behind bars. I just wish I could get her out of here soon. I don't know why, but I feel there is something in the air here making everything a bit too randy.' You ask Drake to elaborate what does he mean by [']something in the air['], is he referring to the nanites? 'I don't know, maybe. I have a ten-twenty year old M.A in business with a minor in Ethics, not science, so fuck if I know. All I can say for certain is the further away I get from the city, the clearer my head is.'";
			say "     'I just hope it's the same for the girls... They have the potential to be so much more than horny breeders or rabid predators. I don't want to see their pure sparks wasted or twisted by this world,' Drake sighs mournfully. Shrugging, you ask him why he took Ava in then. 'Kathy took a liking to her, and after I heard her story I couldn't turn her away. Can you imagine what it must have been like for her to wander the city barely even a day old looking for the parents that abandoned her? The only creature's she could consider her 'people' calling her a freak just because she's a little different. I know it's probably a common story nowadays, so I shouldn't let it get to me. But when it's staring you in the face, begging for help, and just a little bit of love and understanding.' Drake pauses and casts a sad look at the garage. 'It's too hard to ignore, and if I can be perfectly candid with you kid. I honestly don't know how she made it on her own for so long. Leaving her out there just felt so, cruel.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'I've also seen her survival skills, and well, they are, or were nonexistent. Good thing the nanites take care of a lot of the parasites and what not out there. She'd probably have died from untreated water, spoiled food, or an infected wound a long time ago. Besides,' Drake grins proudly, 'trying to teach her the how's and why's of things has been... nice. Something about watching her learn, seeing her struggle with a problem, and being there for her in those moments things finally click. It makes me feel a bit better about the future,' Drake opines as he crosses his arm and stares briefly at the open sky. 'It's been good practice for when the kittens come due to. Ava might not know it, but she's really taught me a lot without even trying. No matter what happens, I will always be grateful to her for that gift. Anyways, take care kid,' Drake replies as he makes his way down the roof, leaving you to your thoughts.";

You tell him, no, those people are on their own. 'Really why's that? Don't young people love to butt in and make a difference nowadays? Be the change you want to see and all that?' Drake scoffs. Refusing to rise to his obvious bait, you inform Drake that there's nothing you can do that will fix the underlying problem, that being the rogue nanites. No matter how many mutants you pacify, people you save, until a cure or way to contain it is found all you're doing is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic to make yourself feel better. That said, you won't turn your back to those in need when you can provide meaningful help, but this isn't one of those times. 'Then you can see why I hate it up here now?'";

Never really feeling like you're able to do anything about it other than impotently firing off a few rounds in defiance of the status quo. 'Ya, but it's not all doom and gloom kid. Take a look way behind those horses and towards the military's lines. You might like what you see.' Drake counters with a rare smile on his face as his eyes seem to narrow.

Drake says as you monitor their progress, and internally cheer the beasts on. If anyone deserved to be hunted, it's definitely slavers, you muse. That said, how did he know they were there, you query, handing Drake back his anti-material rifle. 'The new eyes are a lot better than I'd like to give them credit for,' Drake replies, tapping his zygomatic arch. 'Still, I wish I had the old ones back.

It makes it really hard to keep eye contact during conversations when a leaf could rustle just a hair and suddenly my brain locks onto it like I'm a goddamn dog with a ball.' Nodding, you tell him that does sound like it could get a little annoying. 'You don't know the half of it, getting used to it though, who knows they might save my ass one day,' Drake says, shrugging. 'Anyways, it was nice talking to ya [Name of Player] and all but, I'm gonna get going now. Don't stay out here too long now, or if you do stay under the pillbox roof. You never know when a flier might swoop down. Most of them know better when I'm up here, but, eh, no point in taking chances.' Drake adds offhandedly as he heads back down the ladder.";

'Hm, you don't need this, we're out of those... there hasn't been an outbreak of that since the 1970's, that spoiled after the power went out,' Medea says, bobbing her head and clicking the talons of her paws in pace with each item. 'This is quite the request, not an entirely unreasonable one, but are you sure you need these? You appear fine.' Medea says with a note of concern in her voice as she takes out her instruments.

Bobbing your head, you inform Medea of Kathy's rather extreme pregnancy, noting how Augustus fears her small stature could lead to labor complications. 'Oh my,' Medea coos, not even trying to hide her interest as she starts probing you for further details about Kathy's swollen kitty factory. Very few of her questions seem to have medical benefits like what does her belly fur feel like, how deep can you push your hand into her pelt, did you see cat paws or human digits when she's quickening.

Lastly, I've included a few pamphlets with advice for new fathers dealing with anxiety that Mr. Drake may find useful.' Curious, you ask why she thinks he needs them.

		say "     Following along a rare unbroken stretch of vibrant green grasses, you come across one of the odd watering holes dotting the plains, albeit one that appears to be much cleaner than you usually find, at least compared to the one's frequented by the local Bald Eagles in the region. As this one appears to be unsullied by the native ferals, at least insofar as it doesn't reek of avian cum and much of the tall grasses and native cattails seem to be untrampled. Wondering why this is you shift your gaze to the banks, and spot the culprit. A large Manticore-like creature with feathery white wings convalescing at its edges. From where you're standing, the creature appears to be asleep, for the moment, though how long it will remain so is anyone's guess. Looking them over their slumbering form, you vaguely recall Drake asked you to keep an eye out for an injured manticore that could still have his family's knife.";
		say "     Wondering if this is the real Mccoy, you slowly circle around the side of the creature till you can get a good look at its face. Sure enough, there it is just sticking out of its right eye like Drake said. Uh that must hurt, you whisper under your breath, noting how the creature's skin still hasn't healed over despite the nanite's best efforts. Given its current condition, you could probably creep up and try to pull the thing out, but that would definitely wake the Manticore up. Of course, this will likely lead to a fight, and while Manticore's aren't the strongest ferals around, they're no pushovers either. Perhaps, a cynical section of your subconscious notes, you should just leave it well enough alone, though you will most likely never have the opportunity to retrieve Drake's knife. However, you never promised to retrieve the thing, and have no obligation to help the man after all. You think to yourself as your gaze drifts along the creature's slumbering form, and feel a sudden pang of primal sanguine hunger gnaw at the back of your mind.";

Eyeing over the beast's rip cord muscles and plush fuzzy balls, you can't help but think of what fine prey they would be after all. The mixture of mammalian, avian, and insectoid flavors would surely make for an interesting meal to say the least. Alternatively, the thought of Unbirthing such a prime unique specimen comes to mind. You've never seen a variant of the manticore infection, and as you paw at your empty womb that's just waiting to host its newest occupant. You realize, you may never get the chance again.";

Every step you take you expect the thing to wake up, but through some combination of luck and skill you stealthily creep up on the feral and wrap a hand around the hilt. Just as you start to pull on the handle though, the creature's one good eye flashes open, fixing you with a raw bloodshot stare. In that instant, it glances at your hand then looks up at your arm as your eyes meet, a perplexed look blossom on its bestial mug as its nanites warped mind struggles to process what you are doing. In that moment of confusion, you pull the knife as hard as you can. Though it resists you for a split second, the blade rips free with a sickly wet pop as the nanites rapidly begin healing the wound, halting all blood loss, and scarifying the damaged site before you can even blink.

Kneeling beside it, you peer over its unconscious body, and note the presence of multiple ugly thick gnarled red scars lining its well muscled torso that are just barely covered by a thinning layer of fur. The worst being on its throat and forepaws. Were it not for the nanites, you imagine these wounds would likely have been fatal, or at the very least highly debilitating. The only other thing that stands out to you is the odd shape of its legs and feathered wings. As you observe the former, you notice they have an almost plantigrade bend. In addition, its forepaws appear to have almost finger-like digits, though you doubt that it would ever be able to hold, or manipulate objects with the same efficacy as a person would.";

The ramifications of which are interesting to say the least. Is this creature a hybrid of the strains brought about by what passes for [']natural processes['] these days, or someone who was overwhelmed by multiple infections? You may never know. Hopefully, at the very least after its encounter with you, and to a lesser extent, Drake, it may at least learn to leave people alone. A part of you doubts this, but it's better to live in hope. Even if it doesn't learn, hey, you at least got the knife back. Too bad the damn thing seems to have picked up a bit of what some might call funk.

Going by the muzzle flashes and the almost blinding glow of the tracers rounds illuminating the man's ad hoc pillbox, whatever Drake is shooting at, is high in the air above him. Searching the sky, you pick out the faint silhouette of a manticore with feathery wings strafing The Last Chance, as if searching for something. Even at this distance, you can hear Drake roaring curses at the mutant between every shoot, 'Fuck you!' *BANG* 'You son of a bitch!' *BANG* 'I will flak up this whole goddamn sky till I bring you down!' slotting in a bright red magazine. 'Now! Eat! Airburst!' He bellows, discharging several rounds from his vehicle killer.

Not so fun when the other guy can fight back eh!?' Drake taunts as he dashes from his pillbox, hooks his left hand on the right rung of the roof ladder, and slides down the side.";

Arriving at the locked gate, you spy Drake striding over to the prone smoldering form of the manticore, twitching on the blacktop at the heart of the parking lot, Drake snarls at the stricken creature, 'Stupid feral, don't know what you were thinking coming here, least you brought my knife back,' as he stomps a boot down on the scorched remains of the burnt Manticore's mane. He leans down and wraps his hand about the turned wooden handle, then yanks the blade out in single fluid motion, muttering. 'Oh fuck, glad great grandpa and the other [one of]Hell-fighters[or]Men Of Bronze[or]Black Rattlers[at random] aren't here to see this. I'd be cutting my own switches for the next month.' As he looks over the pitted grime-encrusted triangular blade and tarnished brass knuckle-duster guard before tucking the thing in the flap of his vintage paratrooper boots."; [Author's note: the 369th or the Harlem Hell fighters were trench clearers in WWI and transferred to the west coast for WWII. Drake is descended from the almost all white officer corps or afro-haitian/Latin American war fighters. He also has vague ties to the Kaiser Reich as many GIs took wives from the old world.]

The downed creature squirms under the big man's boot heel as it claws at the blacktop in some vain effort to crawl away from him. Despite its mewling cries, Drake's hard demeanor remains unchanged, as he roughly grabs the mewling battered thing by the scruff of its singed mane, he unlocks the gate, and hauls it past you. You want to ask what he plans to do, but you figure it's not for the best, not while his blood is still running hot. Besides, you don't think the manticore, or anyone infected by the nanites can even be killed so easily, just knocked down for a while. 'Pardon me [name of player], got to go take care of this before it starts to stink up the place,' Drake remarks in a casual tone as he marches past you, hauling the manticore behind him to [italic type]parts unknown[roman type].";

Searching the sky, you pick out the faint silhouette of a manticore strafing the Last Chance. 'You know what, come on down here you dickless shit! I don't need a gun to take you out!' Drake challenges, as he drops his rifle and runs to the edge of the roof. He throws back his head, losing a primal roar that vibrates not just the air, but your chest too as its deep resonance reverberates through your being. As if in answer to his challenge the Manticore roars back, loosing a cutting knell as it tucks its wings and dive bombs at him. Rather than seek cover, Drake spreads his arms wide howling, 'COME ON YOU BASTARD! Show me what you can do!'";

The big man easily sidesteps the beast though as his hand shoots out grabbing the Manticore's tail. His body ripples with effort, as he twists on the balls of his paws and yanks out of its flight path, crushing several links of its tail in the process as he casts it to the ground. The impact kicks up a huge mushroom cloud of gray-brown dust, and you rush forward to see what will happen next. By the time you arrive at the locked gate, the manticore and Drake are trading blows with one another in the parking lot. 'Bring it,' Drake yells, batting aside the creature's probing attacks. Again and again the manticore tries clawing at the man's leonine face or sculpted sternum, but always from the left side as its frenzied assault pushes him west. Drake back steps and dodges each swipe with contempt and follows them up with swift counterstrike to the creature's face and forelimbs.";

Slowly but surely, Drake is steadily pressured to the edge of his garden walkway, and as his paws brush one of the dwarfed citronella plant's petals. He stops in his tracks, refusing to take one step and risk crushing a leaf of his floral monument, instead he holds his ground, resorting to blocking each blow even as his arms are riddled with vermillion slashes. Perhaps sensing an opening, a steely look crosses Manticore's face as its demeanor seems to change and it lunges forward propelled by a sudden flap of its wings, straight at Drake's neck. You wince reflexively, watching its jaws closer in slow motion, expecting Drake's neck to be torn open, his body go limp like a gazelle, as it hangs from the beast's mouth as manticore's maw closes around the big man's mane.";

'You know,' as his arms shoot up latching onto Manticore's jaw, headless of the damage its teeth do to his palms. 'That doesn't work too well when the other guy has a mane!!' Drake roars, the veins on his shoulder and neck throbbing like angry golden klaxons as he slowly, brutally, forces open the mutants maw. Though it is not so easily denied, as its hot steamy breath coils in the air around them as they were tangles of ghostly eelgrass. While the manticore claws at Drake's golden pelt, trying to overwhelm him, but with a sudden crack.

It lands in a heap making strange smacking noises with this battered maw. 'Had enough?' Drake challenges striding over to the mutant's prone form as he cracks his knuckles.

The speed and fury of manticore's blows knock the wind and much of the resistance out the big man, forcing him to his knees. In that instant the enhanced manticore leaps up and delivers a round house to man's right bicep with a cracking knell, sending him hurtling towards the garage. Drake skids and bounces across the blacktop,  he splays and sinks talons into the asphalt as he comes to a screeching halt, leaving a trail of jagged furrows in his wake.

Barely even able to move, Drake rears back his skull and launches himself into the creature's attack, headbutting the manticore's fist with all of his remaining strength. Bone crashes upon bone, and for an instant, you suspect Drake's head is about to crack as his right eye socket buckles just a hair inward. When a shockwave ripples through the manticore's arm as its muscle spasms uncontrollably as if a bubble of air were pushed between the subcutaneous tissue. Its knuckles crumple and fingers crack inwards as it stumbles back, recoiling in pain.";

As a violent wet cracking sound splits the air, the creature's bulges upwards at an odd angle then falls limp at its side. Reflexively, it tries to cradle the damaged limb, but Drake doesn't give it the chance, as he spears himself into the creature's core and rams into the gate, knocking the wind out of it as its stunned form slumps against Drake's back.

The nanites are already hard at work repairing it, and Drake, you note, watching their cuts steam shut and Drake's eye socket slide back into proper place as if the damage were never there. You realize the two could probably go on fighting eternally, were it not for Drake's violence of action. 'Stupid feral,' Drake growls, spitting a wad of blood and fractured canines on the ground.";

'Shit,' Drake hisses gazing at rust and grim spotted metal, 'this thing has seen better days, glad my great grandpa and the 369th aren't here to see this. *Sigh*, they'd belt my furry ass bald for the next month, for this,' Drake murmurs as sets the rusty thing down reverently, he then turns to you roaring, 'YOU! MOVE! NOW!' with curt bob of his bloodied mane, as he unlocks the gate, 'I got to get rid of this fucking thing, before it's stink starts bringing in the Neshers.'

While the crossguard and handguard taken from a MK. 1 trench knife has been crudely affixed to handle lending it an odd chimeric look.
