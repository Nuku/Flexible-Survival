Your upper body, though rather humanoid in build, still hosts a set of retractable membranes between your clawed digit and tight yet elastic midriff[if Energy of Galaxite >= 2]. Sprouting just below your waist are a pair of massive bat-like wings. Highly articulate, the many jointed appendages are just as dexterous as, if not more so in some regards, than your hands as their flexible ball-and socket joints can bend into any shape you desire.

	now face change entry is "a proud rumble issues from your lips, as fathomless pressure blossoms along your jawline. Bones crackle and cartilage twists as your flesh is drawn out like supple clay as your face lengthens into a predatory draconic maw lined with rows of hardened, barbed, saber-like fangs swirling into existence. The pressure shifts to the edges of your skull as a set of tender lumps swell, pulling the changing flesh tight.

Your body almost seems to writhe with the essence of change as two large powerful paws burst forth from your hips. Unbalanced, you start to fall only to have these new limbs catch you. Meanwhile, your lower half expands behind you as the lancets of shadowy energy crackle along your chaotic contouring figure like lights on a runway. Your spine lengths and takes on a vaguely serpentine build, as your legs reshape themselves into a proper digitigrade stance.
