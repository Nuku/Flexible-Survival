Last Chance Lobby	"Last Chance Lobby"

Last Chance Lobby is a room.
Description of Last Chance Lobby is "[lastchancelobbydesc]".
the scent of The Last Chance lobby is "There is a distinct smell of aromatic smoke with a low under current of old wood and feline musk.".

to say lastchancelobbydesc:
	say "     The air here is stale smelling of a heady smoke with an undertone of feline. Five tan leather seats are huddled up against the aft side of the room next to a 5x5 window pane. A carpet dyed light-brown covers the floor, its surface pockmarked by the trampling of innumerable visitors, not all of them human though. The lobby's eggshell-white facades are decorated in yellowing letters of apparition from prior customers. Surprisingly, up until the year 1991 all the missives are addressed to a person named Rufus Drake, not Augustus. The more recent documents appear to be from film crews, many of them crime dramas thanking A. Drake for the use of The Chance. In the rear sits an unadorned wooden counter with an open logbook collecting dust set on its surface. Behind it is a collection of numbered room keys kept in small locked cubby holes similar to P.O. boxes. Wedged beside this is a large wooden door marked: Staff supplies.";

Last Chance Lobby is north of the Last Chance Parking Lot.

Last Chance Parking Lot is a room. It is fasttravel.
Description of Last Chance Parking Lot is "[lastchanceparkinglotdesc]".
the scent of The Last Chance Parking Lot is "Dusty with a weakening current of burnt rubber and fouling gasoline.".

to say lastchanceparkinglotdesc:
	say "     Constructed in the late nineteen fifties, the two story red-tile roofed building is neither flashy nor boring. It has a simple yet solid utilitarian build indicative of an architect more interested in longevity than style. While its beige stucco walls are free of the normal claw marks or bodily fluids tainting the city, all but one of rooms, room 020, has a notice on the door citing the need for maid service. The building itself is surrounded on all sides by smooth cement walls. The complex itself is about the size of a school's playground, able to accommodate over thirty cars and a quarter that many trucks. Though at the moment the area is completely empty as everyone with a vehicle and half a brain already took off. Whether or not people made it past the military quarantine is anyone's guess. To the west, you can see a small garden patio set up as a place for travelers and customers alike to stretch their legs after a long drive. In the eastern quartet of the Last Chance, you can see an auto shop blended with a camping supply store proudly advertised as the only rest stop in over fifty miles. Sadly, the hiking outlet is sealed by a padlock bigger than your head. A sign tacked on the door reads: Trespass at your own risk. The car garage looks to be open though. Towards the north is the lobby window, behind it you can see Drake standing behind the counter. To the side of the hotel, you spy a ladder leading up to the roof. Adjacent to it are the stairs leading up the second floor and to room 020.";

Last Chance Parking Lot is east of Drake's Garden.

Room 020	"Room 020"

Room 020 is a room.
Description of Room 020 is "[room020desc]".
The scent of Room 020 is "Replete with the scent of feminine arousal and exotic spices.".

to say room020desc:
	say "     The lone couple's suite in the Last Chance motel. Boasting polished hardwood floors mixed with cut stone tiles, Room 020 is quite well furnished with a king size bed tucked along the walls. Beside the bed are twin nightstands made of Mahogany placed next to the headboard. A few feet from the foot of the bed is a dining table draped in a deep blue cloth and a pair of comfy wooden dining chairs. Adjacent to the entrance is a sliding window that allows a healthy amount of natural light to play off the clean eggshell-white walls. In the back is a small kitchen area with a sink, toaster oven, and a coffee pot arrayed on a wooden countertop. Beside the cooking nook is a full bathroom, currently out of service. You can see Kathy happily reading a copy of [one of]How to win friends and influence people[or]The American Thesaurus[or]Economics explained[at random] on her king sized bed.";

Room 020 is inside from Last Chance Parking lot.

Drake's Garden	"Drake's Garden"

Drake's Garden is a room.
Description of Drake's Garden is "[drakesgardendesc]".
The scent of Drake's Garden is "Lightly floral mixed with a musky tang of wet hay and coils of sweet citronella.".

To say drakesgardendesc:
	say "     Kept painstakingly neat despite the nanite infection, this garden is home to a remarkable number of California poppies. The plants are properly pruned and tended with petals ranging from soft whites, to deep reds, vibrant yellow, common oranges, even light purple, and exotic blue versions are woven together like the arms of a prismatic spiral galaxy. Each arm is rimmed by a collection of dwarfed marigolds and mosquito bushes. Gaps between the flower beds have been filled with water-polished serpentine, low quality garnets, and rough beach glass in all but four spaces. These sections ordered around the halfway points of the compass have solid redwood wooden walkways connecting them to the garden's heart. A simple wooden platform barely large enough to host five individuals. At its core is a bronze plaque whose metal gleams in the sun like it were just poured today can be found in the middle with the words: [']In loving memory of Sam, Dakota, and Rufus if there is a place beyond death, may we meet again there. If not, then I will carve one for us.['] engraved upon it by hand[if perception of Player > 20]. Interestingly, the [']and Rufus['] appears to be more recent albeit crude addition to plaque that looks to have been cut into the metal rather than chiseled like the rest. Looking closely, you can see a small gleaming piece of steel wedged in the [']S['] of Rufus[end if].";

Drake's Garden is west of Last Chance Parking Lot.

Section 5 - Sniper's Perch

Object	Name
Sniper's Perch	"Sniper's Perch"

Sniper's Perch is a room.
Description of Sniper's Perch is "[snipersperchdesc]".
The scent of Sniper's Perch is "Carries the smell of parched earth and dry flowers, you would almost call it calming like someone was a bowl of old potpourri below your nose. Though when the wind picks up, the subtle sweet scent of rust and decay is brought with it. Try as you might to hold your breath or cover your mouth, the acrid chemical tang always seems to find a way to sully your senses.".

To say snipersperchdesc:
	say "     Climbing up the worker's ladder, you are elevated two stories above the plains. From this vantage, you have a near perfect view of the rolling grasses, collapsed structures, and other waning symbols of humanity that litter the plains. Off in the distance, you can make out both the city limits and the quarantine line drawn by the military. Though the red tile roof top has very little going on at the moment, you spy four makeshift wind flags have been attached to the chance's awnings. At the core is a simple ring of sandbags with a tin roof scavenged from the plains anchored to it by way of cheap two by fours. Inside are several cases of ammo all of them bearing scratched up army ID tags. One in particular stands out to you as it has the words: For emergency use only, written in bold red sharpie ink.";

Sniper's Perch is above Last Chance Parking Lot.

Section 6 - Last Chance Auto Body

Last Chance Auto Body	"Last Chance Auto Body"

Last Chance Auto Body is a room.
Description of Last Chance Auto Body is "[lastchanceautobody]".
The scent of Last Chance Auto Body is "Calming, like standing atop a dry mountain moments before a rainstorm, or linens freshly pulled from the dryer.".

To say lastchanceautobody:
	say "     Able to accommodate everything from the aged VW bug to eighteen wheelers, this car garage has recently been converted into a one-story loft for Ava. Gone are myriad tools of the trade, in their place, a plain brown carpet has been thrown over parts of the cement floor, hiding years of oil stains not to mention the hydraulics. Nestled in a corner of the building is a quartet of mattresses arranged two by two in a fashion similar to a Japanese futon. Over which an improvised bed sheet sewn from a number of mismatching ones has been draped. The majority of the structures' standing walls appear barren, all but one that is. In the rear of the building, you see a collection of old world lithography has been affixed to the façade. Scattered throughout the garage are towering stacks are examples of pre-infection iconography in different states of deconstruction. As it is, you have no idea what Ava intends to create out of this extemporaneous swath of pre-infection imagery.";

Last Chance Auto Body is east of Last Chance Parking Lot.
