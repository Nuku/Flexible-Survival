The voice yells, though its cry is slightly distorted as it echoes off the cold stone walls. 'Hey, if someone's out there, I could really use some help! The floor collapsed out from under me, I'm trapped, and can't feel my legs! Please, if someone's out there [bold type]HELP![roman type]' they wail over an almost resigned pitiable whimper.

Your hurried footfalls echo throughout the humid corridors as the unseen person screams and hollers after you, begging you for aid. With each passing second, their voice cracks in desperation. They promise you gold, sex, their first born child, anything you want if you'll just save them, or at the very least send help. Though as it becomes ever more obvious you're moving away from them.

			say "     Unable to leave this person in the lurch, or perhaps curious about the nature of their situation, you head off in what you think is the direction of the feminine-sounding voice. As proficient a survivor as you may be though, it's easy to get yourself turned around in the oppressive gloom of the sewer tunnels as the resounds and through the interlinked web of passageways. More than once, you find yourself walking down deadends, or stopped by the odd decrepit tunnel in varying stages of collapse. Some are riddled with gnarled black roots and strange red fleshy vines likely originating from the otherworldly nanite-enhanced plants of urban forest or the swamp. Others show signs of water damage as pools of foul-smelling water cascade from deep umbral gouges in the ceiling and pools about the cracked floor as the city's failing utilities likely burst from the lack of maintenance, or result of the geological disturbance brought about by the destruction of the capitol district.";
			say "     Growing desperate, and a tad frustrated by the constant stream of setbacks, you call out to them, asking where they are, not caring who hears you at this point so long as you can locate this fellow survivor. 'I, um I'm not sure, I was following the purple line out towards the bay when the ground gave way,' the distorted voice yells from somewhere. Looking around you can't see anything that could be called a [']purple line['], just pipes, pipes, and more freaking pipes, than it hits you. The overhead utility lines are all painted different colors, likely to denote their contents. Poking around the area, you soon find one dyed a rich magenta. [if perception of player >= 20]Though something about them seems a bit... off, none of them have pipe clamps securing them to the ceiling, and a few even seem to have been woven around the older lines like a wet noodle. Guess the city was cheaping out on maintenance, you opine following the down towards what you hope is the bay[else if perception of player < 20]Oddly, unlike the rest of the pipe which are rather faded, coated in grim, or riddled with rust bubbles, the purple pipelines are all coated in pristine glittering dye as if someone just came by and painted them. Perhaps they were installed recently, you muse, following the branches down towards what you assume is the bay[end if]."; [Note: IRL a purple pipe denotes a line carrying dangerous or toxic chemicals in need of special treatment.]

Unbidden sweat and condensation drip down your face along with the nearby walls in warm copper-scented rivulets. It feels like you've walked into a monsoon jungle, or the mouth of a great decaying creature as the once still air coils and writhes about you. Which should be impossible this far underground, but you push aside such idle intrusive thoughts for the moment to concentrate on the task at hand. As you call out once more, letting the fellow survivor know you've found the line, and you're on your way. 'Oh thank Tiamat! You sound a lot closer now, just watch your step! The whole place has gotten really unstable recently,' the resounding echo of the survivor's voice hollers back in slightly relieved, though still somewhat rattled, tone. Nodding your head in acknowledgement, you voice your appreciation as you eye up some of the jagged cracks forming in the nearby walls with suspicion.";
			say "     You proceed at a measured pace keeping one eye on the ground and the other on the ceiling. As the pathway grows ever more decrepit, you have to duck and dive out of the way of a few falling bits of cement and old brick as the ground almost seems to shift and tremble in aggravation of your trespass. Each loud crash echoes throughout the sewer with a broken distorted knell almost as if you were underwater. Still, you push on and after rounding yet another twisting path in your strange circuit, you finally come upon the trapped survivor. She, at least you assume they are a she going by the presence of the pair of shapely c-cups covered up by a plain black t-shirt, is halfway buried up to their diaphragm in broken concrete. At first glance they at least appear to be mostly human (at least from the waist up) with deathly pale olive skin. Their face, despite being covered in sweat and grime, has classic almost ageless beauty like one would see on ancient Greek statues. While their ears resemble a set of blue aquatic fins with a pronounced reptile or draconic bend, and are framed by long black hair.";

Strewn all around them are dozens of empty water bottles, the remains of energy bar wrappers, alongside a sturdy looking hiking backpack. As your eyes meet, they wave you over exclaiming, 'Holy shit you're real! I haven't seen anyone in days, even the mutants seem to avoid this place. I thought,' they mumble in cadence boarding on mania as they shake their head in disbelief at the sight of you, 'I thought, I was starting to go crazy when I heard your voice.' Assuring them that you are very much real, you gingerly head over to get a better look at their predicament. You realize the poor person has definitely been here quite awhile if the mess wasn't enough of an indication. The area around them is covered in rusty red speckled scratch marks. Their fingertips likewise have all been ground to raw jagged bloody edges, and their arms are covered to the elbows in gray grime.";
			say "     The cement adjacent to them though is crushed to finely-ground moist gray sand. Almost like it had undergone a partial form of liquefaction then sealed itself perfectly around them like a glove. The more you look at it, it's a wonder they weren't crushed to death, or can even breathe based on how tight the material hugs their hourglass waist. You muse, grimacing at the thought. 'That bad eh?' the post-human asks, noticing the dour look on your face. Offering them a reassuring smile, you try to tell them not to worry as you consider your options. The obvious answer would be to try and pull them out. Your combined strength may just do the trick. Alternatively, you could try convincing the Wolverines at the Mall, or perhaps some of its residents to send down a rescue party to dig them out. If you're feeling particularly malicious, you could also just steal their bag and its contents. A good backpack would be quite useful given the state of the world, after all every pound of carry capacity counts. It's not like they can stop you anyways.";

					say "     Resolving to take the more direct approach to solving this situation, you tell the survivor that you're going to try to pull them out. 'Uh, I don't know if that will work, but it's better than sitting here waiting for my supplies to run out,' the survivor quips as they brace their arms along the edge of the strange sinkhole. Walking behind them, you squat down and hook your arms under theirs telling them on the count of three to push with all them might while you pull. 'Ok,' the monster person replies in a dubious tone, bracing their arms beside them. Right, one, two, THREE! You grunt and lift with all the strength your [BodyName of Player] legs can muster. The ground creaks and groans as the tightly packed rubble resists your efforts, though little by little, you feel it slowly giving way as tiny fissures form across the surface of the compacted gray substrate. Encouraged, you push yourself even harder, and feel the rubble finally give way, with an oddly wet organic pop like someone was cracking their knuckles, as the survivor slips loose.";
					say "     You both go stumbling backwards, landing in a pile a few yards away as the ground you were just standing on seems to knit shut. Equally stunned by the alien sight, the two of you stare slack jawed as the ground seamlessly repairs itself before your eyes. 'D-did you just see that too, or am I really starting to go mad?' the survivor asks, their voice overflowing with fear as they point accusingly to the spot where the hole just was. Nodding nervously you tell them yes, you did. 'Ok, fuck this place and the horse it rode in on, I'm getting the hell out of here!' They cry as they try to rise on bare shaky legs. Looking like a newborn calf trying to take its first steps, they barely even manage to stand up before collapsing in a spread eagle position on the ground with a hard thud. 'Shit my legs must still be asleep and,' they pause to take hold of and massage the shapely thighs of their right leg, 'what in the fucking hell happened to my fucking leather shorts! SHIT! GOD-FUCKING-DAMN IT, those were from Mr. S leather!'";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     She, you confirm, noting the plush lips of her slightly dripping pale-bronze pussy, which she makes no effort to cover as she cries, motioning to her sweaty unnaturally-pasty-looking limbs. Unsure what to say to her, and not wanting to stick around in this crazy place any longer, you grab her bag and offer her your hand. 'Thanks, you're a real lifesaver,' she grunts, pulling herself up to her full height of five foot six. She drapes her left arm over your shoulders for support. The pair of you swiftly shuffle off, though you both eye the spot where the pit was mere moments ago, rather banefully. Already the floor seems to have been completely repaired, almost like the large rent in the ground was never even there. While it's not the oddest thing you've seen in recent days, this is definitely going on the list you muse, trudging your way back to the mall. Along the way, the survivor appears to perk up a bit as the color gradually returns to her legs. She's soon able to walk on her own power, albeit somewhat slowly.";
					say "     Not wanting to tire them out, you decide to let them set the pace and try striking up a bit of small talk to pass the time. Minutes pass and you eventually learn her name is Galaxite, or at least she claims it is, and that she was apparently looking for a supposed group of survivors that have set up shop near one of the many ghost stations hidden under the city. If what she says is true, they allegedly have access to water and power but are said to be a tad isolationist. Curious about her plans, you ask what she was hoping to accomplish by finding them. 'Well, I was sort of hoping we could work out some kind of trade deal. I mean everyone needs utilities, right? I've seen huge brawls break out in the mall over who gets to use a half dead power brick. Can you imagine how much folks would pay just to charge their phones or laptops right now? I'd probably be set till help arrives if I could pull this off!' Galaxite proclaims, rather proudly and greedily at the thought. True enough, but why is she in the sewer if she's looking for a ghost station?";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Shouldn't she be prowling the metro lines, not this god forsaken Shaft Beast and demon-infested hell hole, you reply. 'Right... well I probably shouldn't tell you this but-,'  Galaxite pauses to look around the tunnels. 'Most of the decommissioned stations are blocked off in one way or another to prevent homeless people from squatting in them, or to keep copper thieves out,' she adds, gesturing to some rubber insulated wires above you. 'The city still needs access from time to time, never know when a sump pump will break down, or a rat will chew through a power cable. From what I hear, a lot of these hidden accessways are in the sewers. If I find it, I should be able to climb right down to the ghost station. Well,' she shrugs with a bemused half smirk, 'that was the theory,' she adds as the two of you come in sight of the hole leading back up to the mall. Gazing at the lantern light spilling down from the world above, Galaxite pauses and turns to you saying in a bemused tone.";
					say "     'Hey, I know this may be a bit of an ask, but uh,' she hesitates rocking back and forth of her heels as she nervously eyes the exit, 'could you go on ahead and maybe find me a newspaper or something to cover up the goods? I don't feel comfortable walking around half naked this close to the Shag Shack. Wouldn't want the locals to get the wrong idea,' she jokes through a Cheshire smile, motioning to her lower half with a knowing flourish. Shrugging, you reply that's probably wise and hop ahead of her then root around the area for a bit. Thankfully, due to the lack of trash pickups the surrounding environment is littered with all sorts of random crap people abandoned when the pandemic started. It's not long to till you slightly less abused news rag laying about and pass it down to Galaxite. 'Thanks, you fucking rock!' she says, wrapping the moldering paper around herself like a towel and then pulls herself out. Once she's standing on Terra-firma and straightens out her shoddy covering, you follow after and go to offer her bag back, but stops you with a wave of her hand.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     'No, you keep it, it's not much, but you're welcome to help yourself to my bag and what's left of the supplies. It's the least I can do, I've got some stuff squirreled away nearby,' she says, gesturing to the outskirts of the mall with a broad wave of her hand, 'so you don't have to worry about me. It's not my first time slumming it on the streets or anything.' Nodding, you express your gratitude and wish them well. Flashing a warm almost too-toothy smile Galaxite returns the sentiment and heads off to parts unknown, muttering something under her breath about meeting someone at [bold type]the beach[roman type]. Once she's departed, you take a moment to dig through the pack. Inside, you find a pair of sugary sports drinks with a black wolf head on the logo, some clean bandages still wrapped in a thin lucid sheet of plastic, alongside a beat up claw hammer, and a few energy bars. It's not your best haul, but at least you have something to show for your work. Who said good deeds don't go unrewarded?";

				-- "Get help.":
					say "     Recalling some apocryphal news stories about people stuck in similar circumstances, you reason that it would be best to try and enlist some support. For all you know, trying to pull them out or digging around them could just make things worse. At the moment, they and the surrounding area appear to be stable, it wouldn't do you or them any good if you somehow ended up getting trapped down here with them or worse; you end up crippling them trying to save them. Sighing in defeat, you tell them you're going to have to head back to the mall and get help. 'Wait what the fuck! You're gonna leave me here!?' they cry, eyes widening in alarm. Nodding in the affirmative, you regretfully reply that you don't have means to dig them out safely, so you're going to need some help. 'Well could you try pulling me out instead?' they beg, their voice cracking with desperation. Trying to put on a brave face, you explain that you have no idea what condition their lower body is in right now.";
					say "     For all you know, their bottom half could be completely pulped. The pressure of earth and their nanite healing factor might be the only thing holding them together. If you pull them out recklessly well... 'Oh god,' they sob, looking down at their trapped form as the realization of the true weight of their situation hits them. Kneeling down, you pat them on the shoulder, telling them not to panic. Someone will come for them soon, hopefully with the tools necessary to pull them out. 'You mean it?' they croak, wiping a soot-laced tear from their eyes. Smiling warmly, you tell them that you do, and head off towards the Mall at a breakneck pace. Thankfully, the way is just as barren as when you came the way, so you make good time. Once you catch sight of the hole to the bathroom floor along with the odd lantern ever burning illuminating it. You vault up to upper level and set about looking for the nearest member of wolverine security.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Like all cops, or rent-a-cops in this case, they are never around when you need them, so you decide to cut out the middleman and head for their office in the back of the mall. You push your way through the crowds of people till you reach the back of the mall and the coffee shop that the wolverines have set up in. Most of the assembled mutants pay you no heed as they appear too engrossed in their paperwork, or fleeting moments of downtime. However, the receptionist among them, likely noting the concerned look on your face, waves you over and asks what's wrong. Bounding over to them, you hurriedly explain to them the situation in the sewers. Frustratingly, the man shakes his furry head, informing you that his company is not responsible for what happens in the sewers. His people have enough on their plate worrying about what's going on in the mall and its adjacent area. Justifiably irate, you try telling them if situations were reversed wouldn't he want someone to help him, rules be damned?";
					say "     Your argument falls flat though as the man seems unmoved citing protocols, bylaws, and every tired corporate copout under the flipping sun. Eventually, your argument draws the attention of some of the locals who gather around to watch your tirade. Sensing an opportunity, you call upon your inner demagogue and begin directing your requests more to the crowd than the man alone as you verbally paint an ever more fanciful picture of the situation. Your oration stokes the long simmering fires of distrust and ambivalence many feel towards peace officers and authority in general. Many of the onlookers stories of past grievances with the wolverines (both real and imagined) flow freer than leaded wine and venereal disease at a Roman orgy. All the while, you subtly offer the man an out if he would simply humor the idea of sending a rescue party. Sensing the collective humans and post-human metamorphs growing ire at their continued inaction, the receptionist eventually yields.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Throwing up his hands in defeat, he promises to speak with his boss and potentially assemble a volunteer search party as soon as she gets back into the office, as he claims that he doesn't have either the authority or the clout to do such things on his own. Satisfied for the moment at least, you tell him that that will have to do, then give him a description of the other survivor alongside her location; all of which the wolverine male jots down on a pad of paper that he stashes away for later.

				-- "Steal their bag and leave.":
					say "     Thinking about it, that bag of theirs looks pretty nice. So nice in fact that you can't see why someone as foolish as this should be allowed to keep it. If they're too weak to take care of themselves, it's only natural that a stronger, smarter, more able survivor like yourself should prey upon the weak and put their meager resources to proper use. Who is to say they wouldn't do the same to you if the table were turned? You muse, eyeing their meager possessions. 'Uh hey what's up, you, uh, figured out a way to get me out of here?' the helpless survivor asks in a nervous tittering tone. Chuckling at their weakness, you stride over to them, you kneel down then calmly scoop up their pack and throw it over your shoulder. 'Hey-hey-hey, what are you doing? That's my bag!' the failed survivor bleats as you casually adjust the straps to better fit your [BodyName of Player] body in front of them before turning on your heel and start walking at a lackadaisical pace back to the Mall, without sparing the pathetic failed survivor a second glance.";
					say "     For a moment, they simply stare dumbfounded at the back of your head as the gravity of their situations fully hits them. You can hear them begin to sob meekly followed by a string of cursing and pleading shouts for you to come back that become ever more unhinged by the second. With each bend you round, the sound of their voice grows more distant, and the focus of their cries shifts from you to the ferals. As they try to get their attention, likely as one last desperate attempt to get revenge on you. Sadly for them, the area is just as desolate as when you came through the first. Whether this is due luck on your part, or something about this odd stretch of sewers is anyone's guess. Either way, it doesn't matter to you as you spot the pale sickly yellow light streaming through the large crack in the roof of the sewers that leads to the Mall's bathroom floor.";

You're only left with a pair of sugary sports drinks with a black wolf head on the logo, some clean rolls of gauze bandages, a number of energy bars, and a beat up claw hammer for your trouble.

Sarea of Beach Reunion is "Beach".


to say ResolveEvent Beach_Reunion:
	say "     Wandering around the crowded-yet-calm pathways of the beach plaza, you're struck by the peaceful nature of the humans and post-humans gathered here. Sure, one or two of the infected and the occasional human get a little handsy from time to time, but all and all, the beach goers seem to be conducting themselves rather well. At least compared to what you've seen in the rest of the city, you muse, drifting through the tightly packed maze of towels and umbrellas littering the area. Nearing the northern cliff face bordering the state fair, your idle stroll is cut short as you hear a familiar feminine voice calling to you. 'Holy moly, [Name of Player], is that you?!' Searching around for the source, you spot a bare foot, heavily pregnant, bronze-skinned, bikini-clad monster woman peering over the shapely mound of her fecund tanned tummy and lush blue lycra-wrapped tits at you. As your eyes meet, you recognize that the golden orbs of the reclining figure belong to Galaxite, the woman you rescued from the sewers a while back resting front side up on a long white beach towel with a red cloth backpack set atop it like makeshift pillow by the entrance to the rocky cliffs.";
	say "     Seeing the light of recognition in your eyes, she waves you over enthusiastically. Shrugging, and a bit curious as to what she's doing here, you head on over to her. Meandering through the various beachgoers, you note she seems to be going a lot better than when you last saw her. Her skin is no longer pale and sickly looking, but has taken on a beautiful glowing bronze that highlights her sleek athletic curves and tight runner thighs. Her breasts meanwhile have gained a delightful bit of padding, most likely a result of her current pregnancy as her cute perky DDs balanced atop her taut tum look rather lovely as they strain against her tiny blue bikini top. Perhaps noticing the way you're looking at her curves, the gravid monster girl fixes you with a knowing grin as she arches her back slightly to better highlight her condition saying, 'Oh my gosh [Name of Player] it's so good to see you! I didn't know you came to the beach, here for the [italic type]view[roman type] I take it?' With an polite smile, you tell her something like, and ask her what she's doing out here.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Shouldn't she be spelunking in the sewers for her ghost station? 'Oh no-no-no,' she laughs, fanning her left hand before her as if to clear the air. 'I'm not going back down there ever again, with all the weird penis monsters, demons, and creepy crawlies, I don't see how anyone could be living down there.' So, she's out of the adventuring game, you ask. 'Nope, in fact, I'm getting ready for my next one right now.' Galaxite pulls herself into a cross-legged sitting position as she gently rests her burgeoning stomach on her lap. Really, what's she going after this time? 'Huh, not sure I should be telling you this, but-,' Galaxite teases, playfully tapping her chin. 'You did save my bacon, sssoooo here's the deal. Not long after the initial outbreak, these weird paramilitary groups showed up and started setting up shop all over the city. Of course, not all of their bases survived all that long, I think the only one left is the Zephyr branch office in the High Rise District. But after doing some digging, I found a few of them along with their equipment are still somewhat intact, but that's not why I'm here,' she says, bobbing her head towards the shore.";
	say "     'See, those bases needed tons of clean food, water, fuel, immunity boosters, not to mention raw materials to keep them running. Now as you can guess, getting that stuff into the city is really hard right now, so a lot of it never made it through. From what I hear, one of these supply convoys was coming by the sea. But, it ended up beaching itself on some rocks out past the break,' Galaxite says gesturing to the ocean, with a languid wave of her left hand. Really how did they manage that, you'd think there'd be charts or records showing where the safe shipping lanes are, you ask. 'You know, I thought the same, but,' she shrugs and reaches into a flap on the side of her pack and pulls out a paper notepad with a pen wedged into the spiral spine. Flipping through its pages, she continues, 'According to this big hunky tiger shark named Kai,' Galaxite rumbling the name in a low lusty draconic treble as she involuntarily crosses and uncrosses her legs, 'and several of the other surfers around here, the ocean floor got a little mixed after the capitol went boom, and Atlantis showed up,' she adds, setting her notepad down beside her.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Interesting, but what makes her think that anything of value survived, you reply. 'Because the local Sirens and Otters told me so silly, well,' she smirks, lips curling into a far-too-wide predatory grin, 'after I gave them a few of my old bras at least,' she says idly fidgeting with straps of her blue bikini top. 'But apparently the cargo was hermetically sealed, not sure why though. The only reason no one's looted it is because the local Pirate Sharks are fighting some Yuppie Mink in turf war over the salvage rights, and, ha-ha,' Galaxite chuckles into her hand. 'Sorry-sorry, I just realized how crazy that must sound.' Tittering, you tell her not to worry about it doesn't sound any weirder than the [one of]rumors of a invisible floating city populated by transplanar anthropomorphic blue gryphons hovering above the downtown[or]stories of a tribe of mpreg-obsessed orcs running breeding slave camps in the warehouse district[or]tales of den of gay werewolves out in the urban forest[or]scuttlebut regarding a giant bouncy castle populated by living latex monsters off the coast[or]Gossip related to a gang of kobolds running around town using their hyper balls as glorified hippity-hops[at random]. 'Heh, right point taken [Name of Player],' Galaxite giggles, in an amused little trill.";
	say "     'So ya, as I was saying, no one can get near the wreck, but... I've got a perfect plan to deal with them! Can you guess what it is? Galaxite asks, as she leans forward and rests her hand on the taut surface of her gravid middle. Eh, [one of]enlisting a diverse crew of talented ex-air men with nothing to lose to seize the boat by force[or]teaming up with a salvage ship crew led by an old sea captain whose estranged child went down with the ship and who will stop at nothing to retrieve their remains so that they can be properly laid to rest on land[or]convincing a team of veteran thieves that she blackmailed into reuniting for one last job that will leave them set for life to help slip past them[or]the power of friendship[at random]? you query. 'Nope, even better, DRAGONS!' she gushes in a haughty dominant tone as her golden eyes seems to sparkle at the mere mention of the species. 'Well, Feral Sea Dragons to be precise,' Galaxite says with a proud look on her face as she drums her fingers along the hemline of her heavily swollen bronze tummy. Wait, she was able to tame Feral Sea Dragons. How is she able to command them, they don't seem to be the most, well, talkative creatures, you ask, perplexed.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Oh, I didn't tame them silly. The wild ones are great lays and give like,' she hesitates a moment as she lightly rocks her head from side-to-side, 'I wanna say the third or fourth best hugs in the city, but they are way too simple for a job like this. However, these guys on the other hand,' Galaxite pants as she leans back to stare at her ripening form. 'After they've had a little drink of mommy's milk,' Galaxite purrs rubbing her chin against the supple mass of her chest, 'become very amenable, not to mention loyal. Why I've already got a small pod of eight handsome little sea dreggys keeping an eye on me out in the surf,' she says, waving towards an oddly-shaped blue-green wave sharking about the shore. 'Once my boys here,' she points to her tummy, 'are done cooking, we're gonna go grab a few supplies and head out,' she says with a dreamy look on her face. 'Say, [Name of Player] since you seem so interested would you like to join in? I can give you a cut of whatever we find?' Galaxite asks, in an eager expectant tone.";

I think we should grab a few gill fruits just in case we need to go underwater.' [if hasgills < 1]Gill fruits? What are those, you ask. 'Right how to explain, uh,' Galaxite says with a thoughtful expression on her face as she wraps her fingers along the sandy shore. 'I guess you could think of them as some sort of mutagenic item like blue gryphon milk or wyvern goop. But instead of turning you into some kind of lowly hybrid or a yucky wannabe dragon, they let you breathe underwater while leaving your current form intact.' Well that does sound useful, where can you find them, you ask[else if hasgills is 1]Wait Gill fruit, you've run into those before. However, you haven't seen another tree in a while.

'Every time someone tries to pick one, the tree drops all its fruit. Allegedly,' she says, her eyes briefly narrowing to fine umbral pinpricks, as taps her left pointer finger against the brown cardboard-esque backing for emphasis, 'anything that hits the ground, or water instantly rots then the tree either dies, or goes dormant like that,' she adds, loudly snapping her fingers for effect. 'Lucky for us, there is one tree growing out of an old beached trawler down the coast,' Galaxite says, nodding her head towards the Wild Fringes. Right so what's the catch, you ask doubting such a rare find would be left unexploited for long. 'Well,' she says, drawing out the word in lazy drawl as her ears flutter along the tips of her raven black hair, 'it's sort of guarded by some nutty old Fruit Bats who keep attacking anyone that gets close to the [bold type]Ruined Trawler[roman type].

Don't get me wrong, given enough time.

Such a prize deserves to kept in a proper wyrm's hoard, not stowed away in a cheap backpack like some dingy bottle of dirty water.";

You can't help but remark internally at how right the peerless smoothness feels nestled in the palm of your hand and the beautiful glow of the divine trinket reflected in your eyes. To think that this mewling human kept this to herself, your altered-mind rages as hurriedly stow it away from prying eyes, lest some jealous manlet dare snatch it from you. 'I see you approve of my offering great wyrm,' Galaxite chuckles through a far-too-knowing grin. Nodding, you inform her that it will do, for now, though she should not assume such a pathetic tithe will buy your loyalty or submission. 'Oh, of course not mighty one!' She kowtows, with another deep quick bow. 'That tiny pebble is a gift barely befitting your growing majesty, though you may find it useful nonetheless,' she preens, eyeing your expectant middles with obvious delight. Enjoying the sight of her subservience and a just hair curious about what she means, you demand she explain further.";

'Though potent, it lacked both a focus and a vessel worthy of its gifts,' she says as the flicker of a jealous sneer flutters along the edge of her lips. 'Until now Kai Monah, you alone are worthy to bear this tiny sliver of its blessing,' she intones, motioning to your gravid body with a languid wave of her left hand. 'However, your current form is but a pale shadow of the true majesty you could achieve. Help me scale sister, and you could be greater than any chromatic dragon of Kyr, Kai, or Kol. Just picture it my thuri,' she coos, draping her arms along the flush core of your expectant form. The familiar pulse of otherworldly energy arcs from her fingertips as she nuzzles her face against the bountiful swell of your clutch-laden tum. 'You could be the mother and father god of untolds hoards of true wyrms, all of them at your beck and call.'";

You will be worshiped, perfect, and eternal reh-ol reck da han kovve nuthi,' the eager demi-human whispers, as her words coil at the edges of your mind as you find yourself repeating the phrase. Reh-ol reck da han kovve nuthi, in a dream tenor, your stomachs swells ever-so-slightly at her touch as the life growing within you resonates with the essence of change flowing through you as hard protective shells grow over their nascent beings. Strangely though, as you run your paws over their resplendent forms, you feel neither fear nor alarm at this development, only pride at thought of birthing majestic creatures. 'Ah, how I envy you thuri, to have such potential growing within you,' Galaxite swoons, tracing her fingers along the taut curves of your lower half.";

When you are ready, seek out the Wild Fringes [bold type]to the south[roman type], defeat the lowly mice nesting in its hull,' she purrs in loving melodic trill as lightning crackles along the borders of your scales in an enthralling waltz of blues, greens, black, reds, and whites. 'When the way is clear, you need only roar [italic type]Naxokaazthur, naal faal hen klov gein los hi bel[roman type], to call my children to your side,' she whispers, as the colors bleed and twist into one another in a vibrant whirlpool of many colors and none. You stare helplessly transfixed by the sight as a sense of weary peace coils about the liminal facets of your mind like the warm inviting waves of some primeval sea. 'Reen Han Na,' Galaxite intones in clear airy cadence as your eyes begin to grow heavy as your consciousness sinks its balmy shadowy depths, 'reh-ol reck da han kovve nuthi.'

In its place is a rush of maternal purpose and voracious energy as your body thrums with the lingering touch of the strange monster girl. Though she seems long gone, her lofty promise still echoes in your mind, as you feel a subtle slithering pressure tugging at the back of your psyche, urging you to seek out the Wild Fringes, to ascend with all haste. Yet, its call grows weaker with each passing moment as your more rational side begins to assert itself and cautions you against further dealings with Galaxite. Who knows what she has planned for you, perhaps it would be best to rid yourself of this form and move on. Still as you gaze appreciatively at your regal draconic figure, you find it hard to push aside her words so casually. If the glorious body is truly but a shadow of its full potential, then wouldn't you be a fool to spurn her gift so flippantly?";

Even the vaunted wyverns and sea dragons of this place would be forced to kneel before you and your brood's majesty, a coiling intrusive voice urges as your eyes drift to the supple curves of your egg-laden middle. You feel a wicked smirk growing on your thin reptile lips at the thought of whelping your own flight of draconic servants. Yes, you rumble under your breath, perhaps you humor the little ape for a spell, at least until you take what you need from her. Perhaps when you're done with her, she makes a nice plaything for your brood, you ruminate, running your paws over the lovely outlines of [bold type]your[roman type] eggs.

	say "     Following Galaxite's directions, you boldly set off towards the Wild Fringes, strewn with trash, driftwood, and jagged rocks. The area definitely lives up to its name. More than once, you have to stop yourself from accidentally stepping on some rusty algae-encrusted syringe or slipping on a tangle of horrid smelling sun-baked eelgrass. Under other circumstances, you might have been tempted to embrace your inner Susan and complain to the people in the coastal management program, if they even still exist. At least, you take some solace in the fact that the vile state of the area is probably keeping the locals away. Otherwise, you doubt that this alleged Gill Fruit Tree would still be left standing. Such a thing, if real, would no doubt make a fine prize in the world outside the city. You can easily see many countries and corporations clamoring over access to something that could give people the ability to breathe underwater without compromising their humanity."; [Author's Note: a Susan is what we used to a call a Karen here in 2008.]
	say "     Heck, you might even hang on to one, it could make a great nest egg for when you get older. Especially if you could cultivate it, why, you'd be set for life, you muse as you trek along the rough coastline. Though your path, if you could call it that, gets worse and worse as the place steadily devolves into a fetid rat's nest of sharp barnacle-encrusted sandstone mounds impeding your path and heavily-polluted urchin-infested tidepools clustered about the shore, forcing you to carefully wade through the off-smelling waters lest you stab your feet on their wicked-looking spikes, or trip on the moldering medical waste blighting them. You briefly consider trying to scale the nearby hills, but you're not too sure that you'd be able to get back down in a reasonable manner. As the farther you look south along the coast, the higher and craggier the rock face gets. Besides, Galaxite's directions were pretty clear [']keep going along the shore till you find it[']. How long could it really take, you wonder, cresting yet another flotsam ridden sand dune on your search.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     [bold type]An indeterminate amount of time later,[roman type] and you're starting to feel like you're on a freaking snipe hunt. Everything is starting to look the same and you're almost ready to turn around then give that over-bronzed bimbo a piece of your mind. All you've found these last few minutes are new and imaginative ways to get tetanus or lockjaw, but no boat, or tree, you muse, peering down the coast at a large pile of rubble about the size of a modest two house that's fallen over a huge section of the sandbar blocking your view downspin. Gazing at this latest impediment with a growing sense of aggravation, you decide that this will be the last stupid obstacle that you're going to climb. If that damn wreck is not on the other side, you are so done! You think to yourself as you slowly pick your wall of rock and driftwood. As you at last pull yourself over the edge of the loosely-packed debris, you let out a low pleased whistle as you're finally greeted by the sight of your search.";
	say "     Roughly wedged between a formation of pale wave-polished chert, the ruined trawler looks like it's been here for a very long time. Its timbers are almost completely bare and sun-bleached with only a few hints of white and black paint remaining along the dilapidated wheelhouse. Its keel, along with the lower deck, have mostly collapsed under the weight of the frame and the large gill fruit growing out the poop deck. Partially submerged by the waves, the massive piece of flora looming over the wreck reminds you of a mix of a Strangler Fig, Rainbow Eucalyptus, and Banyan tree, at least with the way kaleidoscopic roots have grown around the wheel house and taken much of the processing area. While the odd slitted fruits growing on its many branches, are a rather otherworldly sight. Offhandedly, a part of you wonders where it could have come from. Could it be a result of the nanites messing with the seeds of some long dormant species? A mutation of the Awesome Fruit Tree that somehow found its way to the shore?";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Or perhaps, it's something that got transported here in the gut of one of the fantastical creatures that have shown up after the nanites were released? Shrugging, you realize you may never know, and even if you did, it wouldn't change anything. You look around the rear of the wreck and spy the other item of your search, the still intact remains of the boat nets and lines lazily floating in the surf behind it. It shouldn't be too hard to reel those in, you opine, picking your way down the rubble. Only when your [BodyName of Player] feet hit the sand though, do you remember, a bit too late, Galaxite's warning about the place being home to some Fruit Bats. As a rustling din from what's left of the trawler's lower deck catches your attention, eight Fruit bats swarm out of the rents in the hull. They look at you in unison and screech bloody murder at your intrusion then take to the air.";
	say "     They circle, swoop, and pelt you with rocks like an angry flock of ravens trying to drive off a hawk till one drops low and lands in front of you, yelling, 'This tree belongs to the Zee Batz outsider! Leave now!' as it flaps its wings wildly before you in a base effort to look larger and more intimidating. Thinking on your feet, you wonder if you should take them up on their offer. Fruit bats aren't the toughest things out there, but there are alot them. Something also tells you they won't fight fair if you try to take them all on[if strength of Player > 25].

Under other circumstances, you might have been tempted to embrace your inner Susan and complain to the people in the coastal management program, if they even still exist. At least, you take some solace in the fact that the vile state of the area is probably keeping the locals away. Otherwise, you doubt that this alleged Gill Fruit Tree would still be left standing. Such a thing, if real, would no doubt make a fine prize in the world outside the city.

You briefly consider trying to scale the nearby hills, but you're not too sure that you'd be able to get back down in a reasonable manner.

Its keel, along with the lower deck, have mostly collapsed under the weight of the frame and the large gill fruit growing out the poop deck. Partially submerged by the waves, the massive piece of flora looming over the wreck reminds you of a mix of a Strangler Fig, Rainbow Eucalyptus, and Banyan tree, at least with the way kaleidoscopic roots have grown around the wheel house and taken much of the processing area. While the odd slitted fruits growing on its many branches, are a rather otherworldly sight. Offhandedly, a part of you wonders where it could have come from.

You look around the rear of the wreck and spy the other item of your search, the still intact remains of the boat nets and lines lazily floating in the surf behind it. It shouldn't be too hard to reel those in, you opine, picking your way down the rubble. Only when your [BodyName of Player] feet hit the sand though, do you remember, a bit too late, Galaxite's warning about the place being home to some Fruit Bats.

Some slithering section of your liminal mind can't help but chuckle at their mammalian fragility, as the blaring gale and heavy patter of viscous rain upon your thick, oily, scales is the gentle caress of a caring nocturnal lover.

			say "     'Hm, what troubles you kin da mun, why do you not bow before us?' Tiamat asks, tilting her head at a questioning angle. Shaking your head in a rare instance of self-reflective introspection and lucidity, you realize you can not sit by and support this alleged god-creature anymore, not after you've seen aboard the ship. Mustering all your courage and willpower, you straighten your back then tell Tiamat in no uncertain terms, you're done here, she can keep her damn blessing along with the tainted body, for you can't remain party to such abominable acts. Come what may, you will not allow yourself to be further bound to her or the presence's mercurial will any longer. Seemingly taken aback, Tiamat stares at you with a look of pure bewilderment, but only for a moment as a look of profound sadness blooms on her face. '*Sigh* truly kin da mun, you would scorn my gifts over such trifling concerns?' Tiamat asks, tilting her head at a questioning angle. Trifling to her to maybe, but not you, you huff.";
			say "     'Then it seems my sweet Olivia was right about you all along little, a pity, you and her would have wondrous avatars for us, but alas if you will not serve the five heads then you leave me with few options little mouse,' she tuts, cocking back her left hand while spreading fingers wide then lunges towards you in a blinding blurr with her arm aimed at your throat. Caught off guard by her sudden burst of inhuman speed and the accompanying subsonic boom washing over your senses, you don't even have the time to even consider blocking or dodging her as she barrels into you and sinks her nails about your larynx. Stunned by both the sudden wall of overpressure nearly popping your eardrum and the strength of her superhuman grip, you can only stare at her in pure bewilderment as her hand seems to flow into your scales while your body goes limp. In that instance, the presence surges forward, smothering your awareness in a chittering and maddening tide of umbral coils while Tiamat slams her feet into your [breast size desc of player] chest, knocking the wind out you.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Helpless, you can only watch in muted terror as she pushes her soles against your upper half while she pulls on your neck will all her might. Oddly though, you feel neither pain or pressure, but a profound sense of tearing course though your body at her sudden bestial attack. In seconds, the sensation intensifies and your vision cracks then distorts as Tiamat rebounds off your tauric body with your throat still clutched in her grasp. At once, primeval fear laced with unbound dread surges through you as she somersaults through the air, as she sails through the breeze, though you catch sight of your still intact tauric body, its golden eyes dimming by the second as it sways listless in the gale. Before you can give this impossible sight a moment's thought, Tiamat lands on the deck with a gentle swishing sound, then releases her hold on you, letting your body tumble to the floor in a rattled heap. Looking down at yourself, your eyes are greeted by the sight of your original body, though you still retain your prior size and ratios, you are once again for all intents and purposes, human.";
			say "     Chuckling at your confusion, Tiamat strides past you to stand beside the soulless husk of your former self crowing, 'Ah would that I could bottle the look on your face, did you think I was going to kill you?' as she turns on her heel to face you. Barely even able to nod as your every frayed nerve suddenly in agony as the biting cold of the and shock of your violent separation from your old body, you reply you weren't sure what she was going but so long as you're free of her, being turned back into human is a small price to pay. 'Well,' she pauses to languidly run her hand down the side of your former self, 'the thought had occurred to me, but in recognition of your service in returning my Olivia to me and the gracious donation of these wondrous nanite's here. I have decided to let you live,' Tiamat says with a haughty reptilian chuckle. Who, you question. 'Ah silly me, you never told them your real name, did you dear?' she says as her eyes drift over your shoulder. Following her gaze, you worriedly look behind only to have your eyes be met with a sudden burst of ghosty white light and a tittering jeer, 'BOO!' The blinding flash crows as you wince reflexively while blinking tears from your eyes.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     As your vision clears, the pale alabaster light coalesces and shifts into a second translucent grinning Tiamat floating on her stomach with her chin proppeed neatly in the palms of her hand while she playfully fans her legs behind herself. Utterly flabbergasted, you can only mutter a single question. Olivia? 'In the flesh, er,' she hesitates a moment to flex her left hand before her own ethereal face, 'ectoplasm I guess,' she says as she levitates past you to Tiamat's side. 'See T.,' she preens coming to a stop next to the alleged god-things left shoulder, 'I tried to warn you, they weren't up for this,' they add motioning to you with a dismissive wave of her right hand. 'Indeed, you did my [bold type]FAILED[roman type] avatar,' Tiamat grumbles, grinding her teeth in aggravation. 'Daw T., you're not mad at widdle old me are you?' Olivia simpers sweetly as she rolls onto her back and leisurely floats above you. 'No my dear,' Tiamat sighs wistfully, shaking her head, 'as ever you have been a faithful, if willful servant. Still, with no others to claim the mantles of Kai Monah and Hen Klovve, I fear I have no further use for this world,' she rumbles dejected.";
			say "     'A pity,' she tuts idly casting her gaze hither and thither, 'for all its flaws, I would have liked to preserve this place and its peoples from the coming doom, in my own way.' Coming doom what is she talking about, you question. 'Silly mouse, like many of your kind, you are truly blind to the world around you. Tell me, how long do you think the other gods or devils will sit quietly in their little corners content to play their own games? How long do you believe the horrors stalking your sphere will remain content in their current hunting grounds?' Tiamat lectures, motioning to the vague direction of the city with a casual flick of her ears. Confused by her words, you ask her to elaborate. '*Sigh*, foolish creature, perhaps your short-sighted kind deserve their fate so heed my words well little mouse!' She roars, pointing an accusatory finger at you.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'One day, your world will fall, either by the hands of jealous gods seeking to expand their dominion, the ravenous appetites of the infernal hells, the unholy touch of transcendental horrors, or swallowed whole by the yearning maw of Limbo all because you lacked the faith and will to follow me. For I would have delivered your sphere from this doom, remade it into a realm of perfect order ruled over by you and my loyal Olivia forevermore! But no kin da mun!' she spits, stomping her left foot against the deck. 'You lack the ambition, faith, and stomach to make the hard choices necessary for salvation unlike,' she swoons, all the fire draining from her voice as she tilts her head upward to watch the reclining form of Olivia drift above her, 'you my child,' she adds beckoning Olivia to her side with a come-hither flick of her fingers. Nodding, the ghostly image of Olivia floats down and kneels before her fleshy counterpart, humming, 'Yes T.?' in a sweet honeyed tune. 'You alone have shown the spine and flexibility needed to survive and thrive in this sphere, for this I offer you the chance to continue service to me and take up the mantle of Kai Monah. So tell my child, what say you? Will you remain here to idle away what little time this world has left, or will you join me and become the dragon you always dreamed of being?' Tiamat purrs, motioning the mindless husk of your Dragon Breeder body behind her.";
			say "     'Wait really?! I'd love to! But-,' she exclaims, her eyes alight with wonder as she gazes longingly at your cast off shell. Merely to have her tone darken seconds later as her translucent head drops her chest as she croaks, 'Damn it, I can't leave boys here T., they need their mommy, and I-I-I need them,' as she punches the deck in dismay though her strike produces no sound or impact. 'I did all this for them, so they could be free and we could be together forever like you promised!' she sobs, ghostly tears streaming down her face as she fixes her doppelganger with an imploring look. 'I have not forgotten my loyal dragon mother,' Tiamat coos, as she kneels beside the translucent woman wraps her arms around her ethereal head, 'they will be free to join us and recognition of service thus far, I shall altered the oath, no longer shall Naxokaazthur or Ullokinne be bound to my will. But yours instead,' she adds, patting the see-through woman's hair. 'Really T., you mean it?' Olivia asks, her tone brightening. 'Yes child, but I have but one stipulation,' she says, her hands drift down along Olivia's supple hourglass curves as she gently fondles her svelte middle.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'You will be tasked with expanding my broods with all manner of wyrms. I warn you though, it will not be an easy task. Your every day shall be spent in the company of innumerable dragons endless fighting for the chance to claim your womb for their own, so their kind may play their part in the great game of the gods and earn my favor. While your nights will be filled with the ecstasy of birth and the eternal attention of scores of supplicants waiting on your every need. Now I ask you again, will you serve as the five heads commands and take your place at my side, or throw your lot in with a doomed species?' Tiamat intones, as she rises to her full height to await Olivia's reply. 'Mh, that's a tough choice T.,' Olive chuckles through an amused Cheshire smile, 'either get stuck on this rock waiting to die with the rest of the dumb monkeys, or spend the rest of my days playing with every flavor of dragon in the multiverse with my boys,' she rumbles, pawing at her toned tummy.";
			say "     'Indeed, so what say you Olivia or should I say, Kai Monah?' Tiamat simpers expectantly. Bobbing her head, Olivia touches her forehead to the deck in deep reverent kowtow, whispering, 'Zu'un aam ol faal hen klovve.' 'Well spoken Kai Monah, now go claim your mantle while I deal with the kin da mun,' Tiamat says, whipping her left arm toward the churning storm lashed sea. A sudden ripple passes through your old tainted shell, as the soulless body jerks to and awkwardly prowls over the side of the yacht. Seemingly blind and lacking any manner of awareness, your unwanted body hits the railing with heavy thump, yet still keeps prodding till this timbers break and it goes plummeting to the ocean below while the ship, still carried by the waves, sails on without it. Yelping in alarm, Olivia swiftly dives in after it while Tiamat redirects her attention to you. 'As for you little mouse, begone I have no further use for you or this damned world, but feel free to stay and watch the show, or crawl under a rock like the rats your kind descends from! I CARE NOT WHICH!!' she hisses with a snap of her fingers before you can utter a single word in reply as the world goes dark and reality melts away into a gray fog.";

Though undeniably alien at first, the familiar, yet impossibly warped places whizz past as here and there you spy the corrupted images of Trevor lab, its cement walls replaced by innumerable rotting bestial hides coated in weeping sores oozing yellow-bile while wyverns fly through the air in reverse around it. Pictures of the State Fair shrouded in mist and various plushie and latex creatures, their unnatural bodies swollen with twitching masses of pale pulsating fungi dancing arm and arm in a great chain through its gloom-touched pathways singing in broken electronic voices. 'Cyn loves you! cYn LoVeS YoU! CyN 10VE$ y0u!' in an endless loop. Seemingly oblivious to the decay consuming from the inside, they never cease their plague waltz even as their peers disintegrate into gibbering puddles of ooze. While a kineograph of the bunker flickers, littered with floating huskies, their arms stretched to their sides in crude [']T['] poses blitz past you till at last the feeling leaves you and the fog recedes as you appear on the beach along with all your equipment.";

Loot Boxes is a situation.
ResolveFunction of Loot Boxes is "[ResolveEvent Loot_Boxes]". It is inactive.
Sarea of Loot Boxes is "Beach".

to say ResolveEvent Loot_Boxes:
	say "     Figuring enough time has passed for Galaxite's brood to have finished dropping off your haul from the Break Water Heist, you decide to set out on the long hike towards the craggy hills and over to the secluded cove Galaxite pointed out to you on her yacht. Though the path itself is little more than a thin strip of chert worn smooth by the passage of innumerable hoofed creatures, or the uncaring kiss of the elements, it seems, at least for a moment, to be clear of prying eyes or ferals. You muse, following the winding zig-zag trail as you drift away from the beach and closer to the State Fair, the path seems to widen as the steep cliffs give way to the roiling azure waves lapping at the thin stretch of hidden sandbar covered in rows upon rows of black shipping containers intermixed with a few red ones. All of which appear to be unopened, you note as you pick your way down the hillside, you spot Galaxite, still wearing nothing more than her scuba bag and blue string bikini doing a playful series of cartwheels along their damp seaweed encrusted edges. Though you don't see any sign of her leviathans, you suspect they are likely swimming below the surf as you call you to her. 'Oh hey [Name of Player]!' she hollers mid flip as she grasps onto the side of the container with her right hand while she cheerfully waves at you with her left.";
	say "     'It's good see y-,' she stammers as she tips just a hair too far to one side, then goes tumbling off. '*OOF*', she grunts as she lands head first onto the wet sands, with a loud thump, then goes still. Oh shit Galaxite! You roar, fear piercing your heart like an icy blade, as you dart forward, ready to render whatever aid you can. Only to witness her rise, neck twisted well past her shoulders at an unnatural angle as she mutters, 'Oh, I'm ok, I'm ok,' as she rolls herself into sitting position with a sickly pronounced lurch, grabs hold of her head and snaps her neck back into position with a wet crack. 'Ah, sorry about that cutie,' she simpers in an oddly cheery tone as leaps to her feet. 'Hope the climb wasn't too rough on you.' Shrugging, and doing your best to hide your shock, you tell her that it was nothing special and sprint on over to her. Once you're at her side, you ask if she's really ok, that was a pretty nasty fall. 'Heck ya I am, that was nothing compared to the time someone dropped a road roller on me, or when an I.E.D shot me through a roof.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Wait she what now, you stammer at her insane claim. 'What? It's no biggie kin da mun,' she says, her face alight with mischievous glees as she dismissively waves her left hand before herself. 'We're all darn near immortal, as long as well-,' she pauses to nervously click her teeth, 'we don't starve to death. Why, I've been set on fire by an ebonflame spawn, staked to a telephone pole with rusty razor wire by an angry spartan on top of the dam, had a Behemoth use me as a sounding rod, been dissolved into cum by a wyvern, and eaten by Sierrasaur.' She chuckles, counting off each experience on her left hand in a jovial sing-song tone. Shaking your head as if to clear it, you inquire if she's serious. 'Sure am silly, I don't know why people are stressing over the whole [']dying['] thing. The worst that ever happens is you just wake up a few days later with a hangover then boop you're back to normal.' She beams as she takes off her pack and pulls out a miniature version of a hydraulic rescue tool sometimes called the [']Jaws of Life.['] 'Anyways, here take this and let's get to it, these loot boxes don't open themselves!' Galaxite says, pressing the tool into your hand.";
	say "     Shrugging and unsure how to respond to such insane assertions, you hastily look over the contraption and see that it consists of a heavy metal handle sort of like the kind you've seen on handheld vacuum cleaners or leaf blowers, which likely contains the thing's motor. A rubberized foregrip affixed to the frame connects it to a deadly-looking set of flat metal pincers. Flipping it over a few times, you don't see any signs of an exhaust system or fuel reservoir though, so you assure the thing is battery powered. Quite the find, you note and ask where she got it from. 'I stole it from the back of a fire truck not too far from Fire Station 69. Ya it was covered in dal cum when I found it, but,' she pauses to tap the side of the contraption with her knuckles, 'still works.' Lucky find, you quip as you prime the thing and get ready to start cutting. You notice out of the corner of your eye, Galaxite pulling a huge clear sandwich baggie filled to the brim with a silvery metal shaving out of her pack. ";
	if Intelligence of Player >= 20:
		say "Is that thermite, you ask, recalling how Galaxite said she has some on hand a while ago. '*Ha-ha* good eye [name of player], you have no iead how long I've been waiting to use this stuff,' Galaxite smiles, shaking the bag once.";
	else:
		say "Hey what's with that metal stuff, you inquire. 'Thermite, oh you have no idea how long I've been waiting to use this stuff,' Galaxite smiles, shaking the bag once.";
	say "     'The others would never let me set this stuff off before, but screw them, they're not here to stop me this time!' she titters watching the silver metallic sand dance in the available light. Why'd they stop her before, you ask. 'Oh some boring old noise about it not being safe,' she says, rolling her slitted eyes. '*PFT* Don't know what they were on about though, it's not like I'm gonna burn the whole city down with this one itty-bitty-baggy!' she laughs, pulling out a black handheld blowtorch and a fist-sized spool of what you assume is magnesium ribbon. Fair enough, as long as she doesn't set any of that off near-, you start to reply only to have your words drowned out by the hissing of her torch. 'Oh sorry, what was that?' she asks, as she gazes longingly at the streak of blue flames issuing from her tool with a goofy cross-eyed look. Nothing, you tell her with a playful roll of your eyes as you set about cutting open the many rows of rusted padlocks and warped latches. You can hear Galaxite laughing with glee as she sets off dozens of thermite charges in the background. The area resounds with choir of destruction for the better part of an hour as the pair of you cut your way through countless locks.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Once the last one has been disabled, you and Galaxite decide to crack open one of black ones first; you each grab a door and pull, though it initially refuses to give. You have the smart idea to grab a large piece of flotsam wood and use it as a lever, with added toque alongside a touch of clever positioning, the thing finally gives way as a rush of sea water spills out at your feet. Well so much for that hermetic seal Galaxite was going on about, you muse as the two of you peer inside the crate. You're greeted by an odd sight, rows of unlabeled medical equipment hooked up to dozens of heavy metal gurneys lay scattered throughout the waterlogged storage unit while pools of moldering syringes and half dissolved pills slosh about the rust tinted waters. 'Now what in Tiamat's name is going on here?' Galaxite mutters, as you two look over the strange container. Your first impression is that the thing looks like it is or more accurately was a mobile I.C.U or isolation ward then simple shipping crates as you spy a number of tattered clean suits and clear plastic room dividers strewn about that area. 'Hey [Name of Player] what do you make of this?' Galaxite asks as she wheels one around and points to the heavy solid metal restraints welded to its frame.";
	say "     Shrugging you tell her, maybe the government, or a company with more money than sense was trying to evacuate an infected V.I.P. No way a normal person would need this level of restraint, you note trying to give the wrist cuffs a shake. Tough as you are, they don't budge, no matter how hard you try though. 'I don't know about that [Name of Player], there's no padding on this thing, it doesn't even have room for a bedpan.' Galaxite says as she leans down and motions for you to try crushing one of the cuffs with the Jaws of Life, to no avail as your power tool can't even make a dent in the silvery metal. 'Titanium-Rubidium alloy too from the looks of it, must have been expensive to make, and look,' she adds gesturing to what looks like a combination of an E.K.G and an autonomous I.V. device tucked under the gurney's frame. Unsure what to make of it, you ask Galaxite if she can shed some light on it. 'Well,' she hums with a light flick of her ears, 'I've seen something like this when I did a stint at Herrick Hospital after buying some bad acid in the Presidio, huh, or was it the [italic type]really[roman type] good acid at People's Park?' she adds wistfully, tapping her left pointer finger against her chin.";
	say "     'Eh, anywho, it was meant to keep some of the more eh, vocal patients quiet, hm,' she murmurs, kneeling and fiddling with the contraption as she unhooks an undamaged sleeve of some clear yellow chemical slurry. 'Now what are you little guy,' she says in an inquisitive tone as pricks the tube open and she squeezes out a few drops of the odorless fluid on her left pointer finger, then proceeds to wipe a drop on her gums. 'Mh,' she hums as you watch in abject disbelief at her brazen, devil-may-care attitude towards her own health, 'Tastes like Special K, Diphenhydramine, yellow number five, and-,' she pauses to take another lick, 'ooowww Tizanidine, Mommy likey! Don't know who whipped this up, but they really know how to throw a good slumber party!' she titters in open admiration as her eyes begin to dilate and her shimmering golden pupils are swallowed in a sea of velvety blackness. 'Oh hello there, now what are you?' Galaxite remarks, with an inquisitive bob of her head, motioning to one of the far off corners of the gloom shrouded container with a wave of her left hand."; [These chems are muscle relaxants, downers, sedatives, and an illegal in europe food dye, no idea if NZ bans yellow 5 or not cause I'm too lazy to check.]
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Following her gesture, if only to humor her, your eyes are greeted by only a vast curtain of inky blackness shrouding the rear of the container in an oppressive umbral pall, yet as your vision adjusts, you can just barely make out a misshapen light brown lump bulging out of the corner of the crate. Curious, you stride forth, with Galaxite in tow, picking your way through a pile of moldering medical supplies and random ocean detritus, till you reach the back and spy a lump of light brown waxy plastic affix to black rectangle piece of plastic no larger than a man's hand adhered to the wall. Though it takes you a moment to place a name to the odd substance, till it hits you, oh crap C-4! You exclaim with a mix of fear and surprise as a rising urge to flee nips at the back of your mind. 'Ah don't worry about it [Name of Player]. That stuff can't go off, look, detonators fried,' Galaxite remarks as she casually walks up and pulls the lump of explosive off the wall then motions the waterlogged L.E.D screen affixed to its surface. 'See, guess someone cheaped out and forgot to waterproof this.' Eyeing the thing with an air of incredulity, you ask if it's really safe to handle that. 'Well, it could still explode if you ran some but juice through it, but it's pretty much harmless like this,' she adds with a shrug as she tosses it over her shoulder like a wadded up gum wrapper."; [Fun fact: C-4 can be set on fire, shot, dropped, and it won't go off. In a pinch, soldiers are even trained to use it as emergency fuel for fires. Also you can smoke it in a pipe but it rots your brain/lungs and it's highly addictive according to my mil contacts.]
	say "     'Oh well, let's see what the other crates have in them,' she remarks as she heads over to another black container and motions for you to join in. Flashing her the thumbs up sign, you grab your bits of driftwood and repeat the process on the other black crates. Much like the first one you opened, each one has a similar set up though the gurneys are different. Some appear to not only be far larger than any normal person could ever be but have between three to five sets of restraints on them while others have some manner of clear plastic blisters attached to them. Disquieted by your find, you realize the true purpose of the boat you just raided. It wasn't here to bring in supplies, deliver aid, or extract some V.I.P, it was here to capture mutants for study or sport though, you can't be certain. 'Damn fu-,' Galaxite hisses as she bites her tongue, 'flubbing idiots, I can't believe I'm saying this, but thank the gods they went down like they did! Can you imagine what would happen if the nanites breached quarantine!? This thing would be global by now!' Galaxite grumbles, idly kicking the sand in aggravation. Nodding in agreement, you can't believe the bullet the whole world just dodged.";

Oh what the heck, might as well, you reply grabbing you the bits of driftwood. You and Galaxite head over to the nearest red container and wrench the thing open. This time though, the doors open with a gust of overpressured stale atmosphere instead of a deluge of seawater revealing dozens, if not hundreds of sealed cardboard boxes packed to the ceiling in tight rows. 'Now this looks promising,' Galaxite says as she tears into several of them and pulls out a handful of plasticized brown paper bags. 'Nice M.R.Es, water purification tablets, condoms, antiseptics, feminine hygiene stuff, now this is what I'm talking about!' She grins, reading off the printed black labels one at a time. 'Come on [Name of Player] let's open some more, I got a good feeling about this!' Galaxite says, as she sprints off the next red crate. Following along behind her, you go through the motions of jimmying the last few remaining containers.";
	say "     You're happy to find each is host to a plethora of consumables, including fuel, painkillers, chocolate, toilet paper, coffee pods, and a few packs of cigarettes. You even find a bottle of hand sanitizer. All of which you're sure people would pay very, very, good money for during this pandemic, you muse, as you take in the sheer bounty of supplies the two of you are accumulating. Once you tear open the last container though your jaw almost drops as the whole thing is stuffed with guns, sweet glorious [bold type]GUNS[roman type] neatly secured in black metal mesh cabinets affixed to the wall. 'Jackpot!' Galaxite exclaims as she grabs a rifle off the rack and brings one over to you for inspection. Giving it a hasty once over, you realize these aren't normal firearms, these are PHASRs (Personnel Halting And Stimulation Response Rifles)!";

	say "     A rather famous type of non-lethal, albeit very illegal, directed energy crowd control weapon developed and later abandoned by the U.S. Department of Defense. To your eyes though, they look like some kind of sci-fi gun taken right out of a movie, as the full-sized rifle has a shapely ergonomic stock, flowing almost organically into a sleek barrel with absolutely unnecessary muzzle breaks built into the side. They even have a light up red, white, blue toggle for the beam's intensity, you note watching Galaxite flip the thing on. 'Oh this looks so cool! Here [Name of Player] you should be the first to try firing it at one of these egg sacks,' she says, pointing to the squid egg pods still attached to the side of one the container. Really? you ask. Galaxite merely smiles and nods knowingly. Sweet, you almost moan in pure Americanized joy and flip it all the way on, you can feel the thing purr in as its reactor pulse to life in your hands.";
	say "     Oh you are going to enjoy this, you muse, toggling the Phaser to full power, take aim, then fire at the egg sack, unleashing a blinding stream of dazzling polychromatic light erupts from the gun. It hurts to look at but boy it is beautiful, you opine, watching the egg sack shrivel under the concentrated hypnotic barrage of enhanced photons. You bet that you could pacify anything short of a god with this bad boy, and not even leave a scratch on them. Best waste of taxpayer money ever, you swoon as you release the trigger. 'Ow he-he-he pprrreeettttyyy, mh I think I know what doing tonight,' Galaxite remarks in an odd almost dissociated tenor, then briefly casts her gaze back to the containers full of chems. 'Now lets see what else they got in here,' she says, in a much more level tone as she rifles through the gun locker. 'Uh what is this,' Galaxite asks as she pulls out something that looks like a subwoofer welded to were the weapons magazine port should be, covered in heavy watt wire running along the base.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You tell her you have no idea, but you have no problem looking it over. 'Ok,' Galaxite replies as she hands the strange gun. Giving it a once over, you find the rifle to not only be supremely heavy and unwieldy as a large radar dish or some manner of speaker has been affixed to the barrel. There's no magazine port or sign that it plugs into any sort of external system, much like the P.H.A.S.E.R, it must run on an internal power supply. You muse flipping the alien weapon over in your hand to inspect the rest of it. Your fingers brush an engraving on the handle that reads: [italic type]Mk.I Microwave Amplification Device[roman type]. Odd, you muse and show it to Galaxite. 'Wait microwaves... oh clever monkeys,' she says, clicking her tongue. Clever how, you ask. 'Right, so I don't know how common this knowledge is but the nanites can't really handle microwave emissions. Give someone a good jolt of this,' she quips, tapping her nails on the rifle's housing, 'and you could stun the nanites, from what I've gathered, most mutants need the nanites to hold themselves together, so this is basically ricin in gun form to them.' Wouldn't that kill them, you inquire.";
	say "     'Nope, it's probably temporary at best, if that weren't, don't you think the military would have set off a low orbit nuke or two and just be done with it?' Touche, does she want you to fire it? 'No thanks, I still have a few more lockers to search back here,' Galaxite replies in a good-natured tone as she rifles through the containers. She pulls out a set of rubberized black body gloves with yellow paneling on the chest, forearms, and glutes. 'This is new. I knew the military was super puppy play coded, but I never took them for latex fetishists. Wow, even comes with boots and a helmet,' Galaxite trills, tossing the item of clothing your way. Catching it, you look the thing over and wonder aloud what it could be for. 'Well I have an idea,' Galaxite says, pulling out another body glove. 'This suit might block EM waves, considering everyone who comes here is infected, this could be shielding for whoever has to use that gun we just found. Looks pretty durable too,' she says, yanking on one of the sleeves to no effect.";
	say "     Maybe but you're not going to test it, you reply. 'Ha good call, you might wind up sterile, or pregnant for the rest of your life, never know these days,' Galaxite chuckles as she digs through a few more boxes full of suits, power bricks, and fold out solar panels. None of which she seems particularly interested in, if anything she seems rather annoyed, muttering, '*Grr* Come on, where are you hiding little guys? I know you're here somewhere! Homaru and Sidorovich have never been wrong before,' under her breath as she frantically rips through the boxes searching for who knows what. You watch her pile up munitions and materials behind herself as rips the place apart till she finds a small nondescript gun-metal gray suitcase tucked underneath one of the mesh lockers. To your eyes, the laptop sized case appears to be a solid piece of congruent metal created through either explosion or friction welding. The surface appears to be completely devoid of buttons, latches, or keyholes leading you to believe it's either opened with a fob or some hidden pressure points, you muse watching Galaxite fumble with the container.";

Curious about what's got her so excited, you're about to ask what she has found when you notice something that looks like a large heavily-discolored bruise on her tailbone. Did she hurt herself, you wonder as the mass seems to grow before your eyes. The skin of her shapely ass rapidly shifts from a healthy sun-kissed shade of bronze to the same rich blue hue as her sea dragon offspring have. You watch in awe, as the mass expands by the second gaining shape and definition, as the sudden growth rapidly reforms into a thick draconic tail that wraps itself sensuously about her toned legs. Not that Galaxite even notices, so wrapped up in her find, she seems completely oblivious to sleek blue scales blossoming into existence like desert flowers blanketing the parched earth after a rainstorm in the wake of her tail's touch.";

She moans, still tearing at the case, as her feet begin to swell as large shiny pink paw pads form on the soles of her feet. While her toes bulge out and warp into long wicked ivory white talons supported by supple peach beans. The wave of change soon creeps back up to her curvaceous hip, her generously toned ass ripples and expands with a supple layer of scale-wrapped padding as it strains against her thin string bikini. With each passing second, the poor spandex is stretched further and further to the breaking as her hips shift towards proportions better suited for an egg layer than human. You muse, watching the last vestiges of her bottoms snaps with an audible crack. ";

Drawing upon this well of mental clarity, you cry out to Galaxite urging her to control herself. Perhaps it's the tone of your voice, the triumph of your will, or some lingering spark of self control still present in the strange woman. Whatever the case, your cry seems to have some effect on her as she stammers, 'Huh... wa?' dreamily in reply as she ceases her strange frenzy and peers over her shoulder at you. 'What's wrong [Name of Player] why are you shouting?' she asks in a dazed, glazed-over tone as she sways lightly on all fours.

Ow, this is so exciting I can't wait to show these to the boys!' she exclaims as she runs her hand down her scaly legs as if to confirm the presence. Sorry, she what!? You feel your lower right eyelid twitch in aggravation. You don't even know how to respond to this and merely stare flabbergasted at Galaxite.

Mh, I still dream of the smell of hir pre glistening in the sun as it dribbled down that huge throbbing spire.' Galaxite swoons, as her hands drift to her to vacant middle. 'It must have been the size of a house, with these giant pendulous balls swinging beneath hir,' the salutary dragon fanatic rumbles in a deep appreciative trill. 'And you should have seen hir beautiful dripping cunt I bet you could swim in!' she says, her mouth practically watering at the memory. 'Not that I ever got the chance to try, shi kept passing me over for a bunch of undeserving lucky fu-,' Galaxite pauses, her face blushing a deep wine red, to take a breath.

'But none of their nanites stuck, even my eyes and ears,' she pantomimes drawing a circle around her face, 'aren't even from a dragon they just kind of showed up after I got trapped in that weird hole. I didn't even get to see them come in! Which was so unfair, everyone else got to turn into such sexy beasts but not me,' she pouts, hugging her tail.";

Galaxite says, as she dangles the suitcase she was just messing with before you. 'I just can't seem to GET! IT! OPEN!' she huffs digging her fingers into the metal briefcase. You watch as the air around her arms seems to crackle with streaks of multi-hued light coiling about her limbs as a layer of cobalt scales suddenly erupts across her palms. As her hands shift to clawed Dragonic paws, bejeweled with lustrous pearly talons. 'Fu-, frick yes!'

In seconds, her skin suddenly peels back as a pair of swept-back horns surge forth amid a low static pop, not that she seems to be aware of this, as she somewhat gingerly fumbles with the tiny cylinder at her feet. Eventually, she sandwiches one between her glossy thumb and pointer finger, and, mindful of her talons, she carefully rises to her paws to shows it to you. So what are they, you ask. 'Not sure what the chemicals in them are,' Galaxite says, tossing one your direction.

Hm, that is a difficult choice, financial security or saving lives, you opine aloud, not sure how to respond to such an offer. 'I know right, [Name of Player], but I really like you and I'm in a very good mood right now so how does this sound?' Galaxite says, examining her new claws with a smile.

'Good, I knew you'd make a great partner, [Name of Player]. You're nothing like the old man and his mostly boring crew, at least you let me have my fun!'

Shaking your head, you tell her no though something about their names feels oddly familiar.";

From what he told me, they were a pretty virulent infection that could spread just by being near them. I guess,' Galaxite shrugs, sending an adorable little ripple through her egg-laden body, 'that's why they got taken out, I don't have the full story but they were said to be a hivemind of sorts that were taken out by some nameless foxy adventurer before they could spread. However, someone must have kept a sample of their nanites and passed it along to Zephyr. If my contacts are to be believed,' Galaxite says, playfully fanning her tail behind herself, 'the military and a few very wealthy people got their hands on it and tried to revive the mastermind, hoping to use its strange mental powers to stop the ferals. Ha-ha what the silly monkey didn't expect,' she chuckles darkly, as idly taps her chin with her talons, 'was that even in its weakened state the old Mastermind was able to influence the staff and almost broke out with their help, if not for the timely intervention of several ranger teams. Still, they only managed to seal away it.'";

'Oh Mr. Kobold told me, his family was one of the original backers of Travor and,' she hesitates a moment, as if relishing the look of curiosity emblazoned on your face, 'the nanites.' She whispers in toned in a sensuous serpentine trill. Eyes widening in alarm, you ask if she's serious. 'Of course sweetie, I wouldn't lie to such a cute fluffy kitten, but wait I haven't even gotten to the best part!' She crows, her eyes alight with catty glee. 'You see, my contacts and Mr. K believe there's still evidence tying not only his family but members of the government and dozens of rich companies left behind in that facility. Evidence that they would all pay a rather hefty sum to keep hidden.' So she wants to blackmail these people, isn't that risky, with all the chaos going it wouldn't be all that hard for them to disappear her instead.";

				say "     'Perhaps, but that's a chance I'm willing to take, besides we can't leave the mastermind to its own devices. Sooner or later, it will break free, when it does, it could potentially dominate not just the ferals but us as well and I WILL,' Galaxite snarls, eyes dilating to deep frightful umbral pits, 'NOT LET THAT HAPPEN TO MY BABIES!! *RAAR*!!' She howls, lips peel backing into a feral inhuman grimace, revealing row upon row of dagger-sharp fangs lining her mouth as she protectively hugs your potentially kittens-to-be. Her voice crackles with draconic rage as she slams her tail against the sheet metal floor with a teeth chattering knell. The very ground beneath you shakes as this container groans with the reverbent echoes of her shout, your head begins to pound while the acrid taste of copper laced with iron flickers across your palate. Hurriedly clasping your paws to your ears, you try to shut out the dreadful roar, to little effect as the bellicose cry seems to cut into your every being as your beg the demi-dragon to control herself.";
				say "     At the sound of your plaintive mewl, Galaxite seems to reign herself in as her roaring quickly peters off into the background while her eyes return to their lustrous gold hue as she fixes you with a profoundly apologetic look, murruring. 'Oh sorry kitty, I uh, guess I got a little worked up there,' she hums bashfully, flashing you a well-meaning blep. Nodding and wanting to avoid another fit, you tell her that's all right, but in the future, you appreciate a little warning next time. 'Sure thing cutie, I promise,' she simpers, earnestly. Politely telling her you're going to hold her to that, you return to the more pressing matters at hand, like why she chose to keep this information to herself and what's her plan for dealing with this revived mastermind. 'Well,' she titters, nervously tapping her pointer fingers together as she bob her head side-to-side, 'it's not that I wanted to keep things from you, but until Mr. Kobold and these crates confirmed the rumors, I wasn't sure if the stories were true.'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Grumbling under your breath, you diplomatically tell her that's fair, with all the strangeness happening across the city it is getting harder to tell truth from fiction. Still, now that she has her proof, what's she planning to do about it, go to the military, Zephyr, or one the more well-connected researchers still operating in the city? 'What no!' Galaxite huffs, aggressively shaking her head. 'You think they'd leave well enough alone, for all we know they'd probably try to tame or something silly like that,' she rumbles with a deep exaggerated roll of her eyes. 'Even if they could pull it off I wouldn't trust any human with that kind of power.' Idly tapping your talons against the sheet metal floor, you find it hard to dispute her, despite the advantages shackling such a creature could bring, if it broke free once, it could do so again.";
				say "     Much as you'd like to believe your own skills, contacts, and experience could tip the scales, if the government and these wealthy companies with all their vast resources couldn't keep the beast contained. You doubt that you, Galaxite, or any allies you might have would fare any better, best end the thing now while it's weak then risk getting yoked to its will later. You opine aloud as you ask Galaxite what her plan is then. 'See that's the tricky part, since if you haven't noticed things don't seem to die or stay dead the way they used to, so even if my boys dropped the black site down around it, it might... reform. In time, its nanites could adapt from the experience, or even mutate further,' she says sheepishly with a distressed flick of her ears. But she must have some plan, she said it herself the old mastermind was beaten once before, couldn't they find this nameless fox and ask them for help. 'Sorry, I already tried but they just seemed to have just vanished without a trace, however,' she adds with a note of pride. 'My contacts did find references to some tools they left behind.'";

'A set of enchanted swords called the swords of Blood and Darkness, [italic type]allegedly[roman type],' she says, nervously thumping her tail against the ground in a quick fricative tattoo. 'They're from another world, the problem is no one knows where they are not even that super cute jackal lady at The Mall,' she hums with a lustful trill as she idly paws at her beyond bloated belly. 'Well at least for now, Homaru thinks he might be able to find them but he lacked the means to pay people off, until now,' she crows, as she glances down at the tiny case perched upon her tummy. 'With a few of these bad boys, he should be able to bribe the right people in no time. After we've got our hands on those, my sweet dergy boys and I are going to head out and end that thing once and for all!' Galaxite preens, her eyes alight with coldblooded delight. 'Well,' she pauses as her gaze drift down to her bed bound body, 'after the kittens here,' she says given her tummy loving pat, 'are born, I wouldn't want something to happen to our little ones after all.'";

'Hm,' she coos, eyeing up your tauric bod with obvious interest, 'maybe a foot rub would be nice, but for now I think I'll just need rest before heading back to the yacht. In the meantime, help yourself to all the supplies you want, and of course, you can have half the canisters in this case,' she says, tightly tapping her talons on the sleek aresola cans. 'Homaru, only needs a few of them and who knows, you might find someone out there who could use them.' Nodding, you carefully pluck one of the lower rows of cylinders from the case and stash them away for later. Though you doubt you'll ever need these, it can't hurt to keep something like this around, and as she said, they might be worth quite a bit to the right person one day. You muse, you gently shuffle to your feet and begin shifting through the various lockers and shipping crates.

Before you leave though, you decide to check on Galaxite one last time and quietly paw your way back to her, only to find her sound asleep with her arms and legs lovingly wrapped around her delightfully swollen middle. In no mood to wake her and more than certain her brood is nearby, you whisper some simple well-wishes to your little ones then depart, secure in the knowledge that should your latest litter stick, they'll be properly cared for.

Cocking an eyebrow, you politely ask her what demise she's referring to. 'Well as you have no doubt noticed kin da mun, your world has attracted the attention of a great many beings, both wondrous,' she pauses to tap her breast with her host's left pointer and middle fingers, 'and terrible,' she continues drawing her vessels left hand towards the State Fair as her host's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly in aggravation. 'Though I'm sure many appear playful and perhaps even... amenable, your kind are not yet ready to deal with some of the more predatory creatures prowling the infinite. As such, I have come here to restore the barriers between your sphere, or universe as you call it, and the rest of creation. Well,' she titters in a soft sylvan trill, 'for a price.'";

'Why, these nanites your people have birthed, my champion, and your worship,' Tiamat purrs, running her finger down the glassy-eyed mink's back. '*Fu-fu* Though rudderless, never before have I seen such delightful instruments of domination and subjugation. Truly your kind have out done themselves with their creation.' Really, you inquire, surely a goddess such as herself could effortlessly conjure up like the little horny robots infesting the city with but a thought. 'Of course I could, but,' she adds with a muted sigh, 'that would be against the rules of the great game of the gods.' Great game? Rules? What is she talking about? You ask, inquisitively. 'Ah perhaps a little history lesson is in order then,' Tiamat says, thoughtfully tapping Olivia's finger to her lips. 'You see long ago when my kind were first born from the minds of mortals we fought over your worship in a seemingly endless cycle that led to the deaths of innumerable spheres, in an event your kind called: [bold type]Ragnarok[roman type],' she says, her voice cracked into a venomous quintet of hisses.";

Tiamat preens amid a thunder of draconic glee as her host's golden eyes gleam like pools of molten metal. 'However, one day my [']brilliant['] platinum brother in his boundless wisdom put forth an idea, that we limit our power to cat's paws and cults of the sphere we fought over lest we break all of our toys. Though we resisted his words at first, the lesser deus rallied around him and forced a brief pause in our fun as we drew up the rules of the great game.' And those are? You ask. 'There are five, first,' Tiamat begins lifting her left hand before you and raises her pointer finger, 'no god shall make weapons to war against another, lest the arms races consume us. Second,' she raises her host's middle finger, 'no divine shall fully manifest upon a contested sphere for doing so may lead to another Ragnarok and the death of yet another reality. Third,' she lifts her index while crossing her thumb and pinky, 'only priests, cults, demons, angels, and avatars of the gods may wield divine power such as the High Cant upon contested spheres.'";

Right but how do the nanites factor into this? 'Because my champion, your little machines are quite the potent tools and as mortal creations, they are fully exempt from the rules of the great game. With them, I can easily empower my armies to fight beyond mortal limits, breed loyal followers who will never stray from the path, and convert whole worlds to my ways without ever setting foot on another's sphere. Ha-ah,' she cackles darkly, 'in time, even my brother's dull little worlds will fall under my yoke. Oh,' she pants as she wraps her arms about herself, 'to see the look on his face as his paladin's turn upon one another in an orgy of delights!' Huh, quite the plan but how does she intend to bring the nanites to heel if she can't use her divine power here without censure. You reply with a casual flick of your tail.

As such, in its arrogance, its family backed the original creators of the nanites, however your kind's reach far exceeded its grasp, but much to your sphere's credit,' she purrs, as the spell bound mink winces ever-so-slightly beneath the bite of her pearly nails, 'the scholars of this place discovered a means to yoke their wayward creations, hiding among a now lost strain of the infected.' Rightfully curious, you ask what she means by [']lost strain[']. 'Hm,' Tiamat hums, briefly cocking Galaxite's head to one side while her ear fins flicker inquisitively, 'tell me my regal champion, have you perhaps heard of the Sluts and Dominators?'

'They were what your kind call a hive-mind which was able to influence the infected and override the nanites chaotic influence with but a touch. As such, the erudite among the little mouse's retainer found a means to tap into and subvert this influence,' Tiamat nods towards the mink with a gentle bat of Galaxite's head. 'Unfortunately,' she adds with a wistful hum, 'they lacked the means to fully control the Sluts and Dominators groupmind and were in turn forced to destroy their creation. Or so they thought,' Tiamat chuckles glibly as she reclines on to her fuzzy throne.

For instance,' she says with a light click of her teeth, 'my platinum brother, the dragon god of justice, honor, truth, and hope is forever bound to act in accordance with these principles. He may never lie, act dishonorably, or forgive a crime, no matter how petty, thus he is a rather predictable creature.

From them, I felt myself pulled through our ancient link and thus found your sphere,' she says, as her host gently pats her breast. 'Much to my suprise, she proved to be most amiable to my offer of salvation from the inevitable conjunction of spheres plaguing your world. In fact, compared to many of the beings I mothered, guided, and tutored throughout the ages, she has shown a greater affinity for domination, submission, and servitude than my lesser servants. Though,' Tiamat murmurs almost mournfully, as she idly runs her host's fingers through the mink's creamy alabaster fur, 'in my haste to raise her to the mantle of Kai Monah, I perhaps pushed her too hard and almost lost my precious Olivia to the beings dwelling in the sewers.'";

But lo,' she simpers through a low chuckle, 'I have learned such great and terrible wonders from the creature's lingering influences, and for that you both have my gratitude kin da mun,' Tiamat says with a light nod of her host's head. Curious, you ask what manner of creature she's referring to. 'Among the more sagacious deus these nameless creatures are viewed as an offshoot of the gods as they seem to feed upon the carnal desire of mortals. However, unlike us, they do not seem to be fully tethered to any idea or pantheon, nor do they seem to be able to manifest divine powers.

According to their thralls, the process is not wholly unpleasant as the Host's mind and body are not only flooded aphrodisiacs but gifted with unnatural strength, resilience, and freedom from the ravages of time. As such, many have willingly offered themselves to Hosts to experience the twisted joys of this defilement!' Tiamat rages with a petulant stomp of her left foot.

Really, you inquire, surely a goddess such as herself could effortlessly conjure up like the little horny robots infesting the city with but a thought. 'Of course I could, but,' she adds with a muted sigh, 'that would be against the rules of the great game of the gods.' Great game? Rules? What is she talking about? You ask, inquisitively. 'Ah perhaps a little history lesson is in order then,' Tiamat says, thoughtfully tapping Olivia's finger to her lips. 'You see long ago when my kind were first born from the minds of mortals we fought over your worship in a seemingly endless cycle that led to the deaths of innumerable spheres, in an event your kind called: [bold type]Ragnarok[roman type],' she says, her voice cracked into a venomous quintet of hisses.";

Though we resisted his words at first, the lesser deus rallied around him and forced a brief pause in our fun as we drew up the rules of the great game.' And those are? You ask. 'There are five, first,' Tiamat begins lifting her left hand before you and raises her pointer finger, 'no god shall make weapons to war against another, lest the arms races consume us. Second,' she raises her host's middle finger, 'no divine shall fully manifest upon a contested sphere for doing so may lead to another Ragnarok and the death of yet another reality.

With them, I can easily empower my armies to fight beyond mortal limits, breed loyal followers who will never stray from the path, and convert whole worlds to my ways without ever setting foot on another's sphere.

Oh,' she pants as she wraps her arms about herself, 'to see the look on his face as his paladin's turn upon one another in an orgy of delights!'

'To dislodge them she's going to have to put all her power and attention into me and in that moment, she's going incredibly vulnerable which gives us a chance to turn the tables on her and rebuild the barrier between us and the infinite.' That sounds dangerous, and what's to stop her or any other god-like being from tearing them down again.

'Because we'll be there to stop them [name of player]!' Olivia exclaims, jovially flexing her toned left arm before you.

On the one hand,' she says, holding her left arm out before herself while cupping her hand into the shape of a bowl. 'If we bow down to the goddess, she'll keep us safe and put an end to the nanites once and for all, then the pair of us will be put in charge of this sphere. However, that will mean living under her rules. Sure, T. doesn't care what anyone does in their spare time, or fret over who and what they love, but still...' Olivia clicks her tongue worriedly.

Assuming Tiamat can't exert her influence over them from beyond the veil, you interject.

I-I am sorry I dragged you into this, which is why I want you to be the one to make this decision. If you want to support T. or turn on her, then me and the boys will have your back either way.'

Worlds would bow to your will, legions of adoring worshipers will chant yours and your flight's name, not to mention you'd free the Naxokaazthur and Ullokinne from their bondage. And all that it will cost you is a few paltry words of subservience and a little kowtowing to the goddess. Of course, you have a rare, if not one-of-a-kind opportunity to make a real difference here, though it would mean sacrificing your chance at apotheosis or something near enough and a degree of constant vigilance.

'So maybe T. needs each of us to act as some kind of stand in for each aspect of her pantheon.' But she's not sure? 'Nopers,' Olivia simpers, childishly shaking her head. Really, she's got access to Tiamat's transplaner social media, so she must be able to dig something up, not to mention there must be some deus somewhere that can help.

Of course,' she adds with an air of severity, 'you'll need to give them a reason to stick by you if you decide to make a play.' Nodding, you ask if she has any further suggestions. 'Hmm,' Oliva rumbles through pursed lips, 'Just one, you'll need to walk a fine line between indulging your cultists and projecting the image of a big stern dommy dragon mommy.

Your roar distorts, echoes, and loops back in on itself in a chittering knell as you burst through the other side and find yourself standing before the beaming face of Olivia...

"Advanced Tactical Helmet"	"A clear divergence from the human norm in terms of design, this tactical helmet appears to have been made to only be worn by the largest horniest infected person. For whatever reason it was built this way though you can't be sure, however that does not diminish its effectiveness. As the unusual piece of post-nanite engineering features not just robust flared metal rim, chainmail neck guard, but fully integrated latex-esque gas mask with a side mounted filter, and light up red NVG goggles. Interestingly, the plasticized mask portion is incredibly malleable allowing it to fit comfortably over the largest muzzle or beak an infected individual could possess without compromising their ability to talk or breath. Thanks to some clever engineering, this gasmask can also be removed or pulled down in the event the user desires to expose their face."	5	Advanced Tactical Helmet
