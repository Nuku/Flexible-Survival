'You sure do know how to hold your drink.' she says, fluttering on top of your hand. 'someone as capable of you should be able to take a few more, why dont you join me in your next one.' blowing a kiss towards you as she takes off and dissapears into the air. 'Did she have horns on top of her head' you think to yourself, before being distracted from the thought.";[absinthe pixie dialogue]
