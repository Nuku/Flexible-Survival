	now body entry is "thin and lanky, with digitigrade legs that end in padded coyote paws, your hands a cross between a human's and a coyote's padded paws. Your bony body's appearance belies its actual strength and agility";	[ Body Description, format as the text "Your body is (your text)." ]

You almost stumble before suddenly finding yourself able to balance easily on your new coyote-like paws.  As you take a few steps, you flex your coyote-like hands, a mix of paw and hand with pads and blunted claws";	[ Body TF text, format as "Your body feels funny as (your text)." ]
	now skin change entry is "a soft tingling sensation spreads across your skin as soft, scraggly, tan coyote fur begins to push its way out of your body, swiftly covering your body in a sexy coat of thick tan fur that is always a little scruffy";	[ Skin TF text, format as "Your skin feels funny as (your text)." ]
	now ass change entry is "a strange tingling sensation seems to come from your rear as it tightens somewhat, then you can feel a strong pulling sensation as a tan, bushy canine tail pushes out from your rear, lengthening until it is down past your knees before your new appendage is finished growing";	[ Ass/Tail TF text, format as "Your ass feels funny as (your text)." ]
