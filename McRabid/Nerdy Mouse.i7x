Almost immediately you feel a dampness in your cleavage, the little nerd undoubtedly drooling at having a close up with breasts. He pulls back quickly, his face beet red 'I didn't mean it! I would never do... er... not that you aren't pretty. I just.. prefer girls that have an IQ higher than their bust size.' The mouse's embarrassment had been so cute right up [']til that point.
