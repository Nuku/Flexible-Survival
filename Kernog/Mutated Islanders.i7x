Your comfort seems not to be the islander's priority, and he seems to actually revel in mashing his thick glans against your [FaceName of Player] face. His grunts turn more and more guttural, until, with a couple of final thrusts, the mutated islander lets out a long, thunderous moan, and cum begins to gush out of his cock. A literal torrent of thick white spunk, which splashes over your face in an unending stream. With the weight of the islander pinning you down, you are forced to take most of it. You almost drown a couple of time, as the thick, salty semen flows freely into your mouth, and as you are forced to gulp it down in order to not choke.";
			say "     'Yes, finally!' the mutated islander shouts triumphantly. He hurriedly jerks off until his massive cock reaches a towering erection. He grabs you, and pulls you face-first against his urethra. Coated by the copious amounts of pre which leak from his pee-hole, the successive pushes make you eventually slip your [FaceName of Player] head inside the islander's shaft. He moans loudly, and another gush of pre splashes on you. You cannot help but wonder how, even with the islander's humongous size, it seems to accommodate you, stretching around your head like rubber.

Each time you plunge down the islander's urethra, your nostrils fill with male musk. The islander wraps his arms around your chest, and sits down. Holding you and his cock in a vertical position, he humps your gasping, wriggling body until he lets out a long, rattled moan. 'Fuuuuuck!' he shouts, as he cums hard. A torrent of cum geysers out from his ball. He holds you tightly, and since your head blocks the way, the gallons of cum force their way through your mouth and into your stomach. Your belly bulges out almost comically, as the islander empties himself inside of you, as if you were a living condom.";
		else:
			say "     The islander falls on his back, knocked out by the power of his own orgasm. Dizzied by the sheer quantity of pre and cum spilled over and inside you, you do not waste your chance and walk away while your nanites cope with what you endured.";
			say "     Your shoulders, then your chest follows it, with some effort, and your [BodyName of Player] form slowly disappears inside his cock. As your head reaches the base of his shaft, the mutant lets out a shudder which reverberates all the way down your prison. 'Damn, that feels good.' As soon as [if scalevalue of Player is 3]only your ankles pathetically jiggle out[else]your entire body is squished inside[end if], the islander grabs his massive erection with both hands, and resume his prior jerk off. Each of your panicked struggles only make the man even more aroused and pleasured. Eventually, with a loud moan, he cums hard. A torrent of cum geysers out from his ball and straight into your face. The gallons of cum force their way through your mouth and into your stomach. Your belly bulges out almost comically. Eventually even your body and the nanites cannot keep up, and the pressure pushes you back outside. You crash several meters away, covered from head to toe in thick globs of semen, and your belly filled with the stuff.";

[if Cock Length of Player < 20]Your cock grows to inhuman proportions and it[else]your already inhumanly-sized cock[end if] begins to fill empty, desperately empty despite the humongous testicles hanging below. Before the military eventually put you down, you scour the island's forest, ambushing any unfortunate passerby investigating the island's secret, and push them down inside your scrotum.";
		else:
			say "     Keeping a semblance of sanity, you return to Vohr Island, and manage to find other mutated islanders, who have retained their wits like you. They guide you to the abandoned military base, in the process of being reconstructed into a small village. You live there in autarchy with your kin, until the noise of the helicopters replace the seagulls.'";
