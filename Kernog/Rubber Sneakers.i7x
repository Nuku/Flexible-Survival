Section 2 - Usage specifics

Instead of taking rubber sneakers:
	if FurryList is banned or FurryList is warded:
		say "     As you are about to pick the shoes, you notice the puma motif on the sides. The sight makes you have second thoughts, and you step away from the footwear.";
	else:
		say "     As you bend to pick up the pair of sport shoes, you notice that they are made of rubber. You have never seen footwear such as this. You pick them up and turn around, in order to ask whose shoes it is. The locker-room being in its usual state of chaotic orgy and football chatter, you abandon the idea and stash the shoes in your bag.";

	if the rubber sneakers are equipped:
		if Doctor Matt is visible:
			say "     Doctor Matt stares at your shoes. 'This is a rather uncommon infection', he finally says, after studying your body extensively. 'It seems that the nanites infecting these shoes have integrated a defense mechanism, which explains why removing them is so difficult. Talking to me about it was a good call. Matt fetches a small pot filled with a yellow-green powder. 'You will make geiger counters scream for a few days, but your nanites will protect you from any lasting effect. I think. Anyway, try removing your shoes, now.'";
			say "     You do as asked, and grit your teeth, expecting another painful backlash. However, this time, the sneakers remove themselves, like an ordinary pair of shoes. 'Your current infection marks remain, but with their source gone, they will behave like any other strain and disappear when the next strain takes over,' the scientist explains. 'Just don't try and put on these shoes again.'";

		else if Doctor Mouse is visible:
			say "     'Where did you find that?' Mouse asks excitedly, as soon as you bring the issue. 'This is quite mysterious. And exciting. Is a nanite colony living [italic type]in[roman type] the shoes? Is it a living species so infected it has transformed into shoes? A new parasitic species brought from the spread of the nanites. Oh, dear, so many things to...' The deadpan look you give the doctor makes him stop his monologue. 'I think I know what they need. Bear with me a moment.' Doctor Mouse prepares a syringe, and plants it into each of your feet. You wince as you feel the syringe prick you, despite the shoe. 'And done. Wait for a couple minutes, then try to remove them again.'";
			say "     You do as asked, and grit your teeth, expecting another painful backlash. However, this time, the sneakers remove themselves, like an ordinary pair of shoes. 'The rest of the infection will be overtaken by the other strains, in the usual ways. I can ask some of my nurses to help if you want,' the scientist says with a green. 'If you notice extra limbs sprouting from unusual places on your body, just come to see me again. I need the extra data on this experimental retro-nanite treatment.'";

		else if Doctor Utah is visible:
			say "     'What do you think I am? A shoemaker?' Doctor Utah hisses when you ask him for help. 'You should go find a medical doctor. If there's still one in this city, that is.'";

			say "     'Oh my, you brought me quite the item,' Nermine says, when you show her your rubber sneakers. 'I could remove them, yes. Yes... Just go sit on that chair and stay still. Good. Now, stretch your legs in front of you. Like that. Yes.' Nermine kneels in front of you, giving you a straight view into her cleavage. The jackal begins to rub your legs. She starts at your knees, then slowly goes down towards your feet. Several times, you cannot help but let a moan escape from your lips, as the massage is more than pleasurable in your state.";
			say "     Nermine's hands reach your feet. She massages your feet through the rubber, tracing forms between your toes and on your soles. You close your mind in content, when... 'Done.' You open your eyes in surprise. Nermine was indeed done, holding your sneakers in her hands with a soft smile. Your eyes go from the shoes to your now naked feet, in amazement. 'They simply needed some encouragement,' was her only answer, as she gives you back the shoes.";
