Version 1 of Xeno Nest by Kernog begins here.

[When exploring the capitol, the player can stumble upon a xeno nest. Low-level SCAVENGING event.

Event should be banned if Player has either of these:
- ovilevel is 1
- player is not female and does not have the mpreg feat

The player may choose to go fast or cautiously, in search of supplies (or give up).

Something can happen during the exploration
1/ Ambushed by a facehugger -> Leads to a dexterity check
2/ Ambushed by a trilobite -> Leads to a strength check
3/ Ambushed by a xeno -> Leads to a fight

If the player is molested:
	End scene: player ends up in a bound state
Else:
	Player discovers a cache, and can choose either food or pure water.
	First choice, ItemGain selected item by 1
	if Player is cautious, they decide to get out, otherwise, they can choose another item
	End scene: player walks away, his backpack filled

Resolutions: (for the narration):
* 0 - First visit to the nest
* 1 - Player was captured and impregnated
* 2 - Player successfully completed an expedition while being cautious
* 3 - Player successfully completed an expedition while rushing
