	say "     As you pass the building's entrance, you hear loud barks, followed by Brennan shouting, 'Stop it Remus! Not you too, Romulus!' You hurry further and stumble upon your friend, looking on with a distraught expression on his face as his lupine companions rush toward a pair of giant rats. Wait...";
	say "     'Aaaaw, they're so cute!' one of them, whom you recognize as Violet, says as she glomps Romulus against her fur.";
	say "     'Umm, sis, you should be careful around strangers['] dogs,' her twin brother Erin says, trying to keep Remus's saliva from landing on his prized pants.";
	say "     'Hey, who're you calling a stranger?' Brennan asks, crossing his arms. 'You're the most suspicious looking ones here.";
	say "     'Who's a good boy? Who's a good boooy?' Violet keeps going, oblivious.";
	say "     It is only now that Brennan and Erin notice your presence. Smiling, you explain to the both of them that you are a common acquaintance, and it seems to defuse the tension between the two.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'So, you live at the restaurant by the beach?' Brennan asks while he takes a can of soda from the shared pile that him, the twins, and you put together. 'Haven't got any problem there?'";
	say "     'Nah,' Violet replies after taking a gulp of sugary beverage. 'The rowdier bunch is downstairs at the beach proper. The cliffside is calm - most of the time.'";
	say "     'We found the key to the restaurant's storage room, so we simply put our stuff there when we're out in the city,' Erin says. 'Besides, most visitors know our faces, and they tend to behave themselves - with some encouragement, of course.'";
	say "     'He means sex,' Violet interjects, making Brennan cough out his soda. 'And so... you got a shelter, old man?'";
	say "     'I'm not [italic type]that[roman type] old. But yeah, I found myself an empty flat downtown. Well isolated, it's as safe as it can be. If you two want to find a better place, well... I would not mind having some company. [if Player is not defaultnamed][name of Player][else][subjpro_cap of Player][end if] visits me from time to time, and you are welcome to do the same.'";
	say "     'Neat,' Violet replies as she absentmindedly pushes Remus's head from her crotch, as if it was no big thing. 'Well, don't be a stranger either, if you pass by the beach.' Violet suddenly turns towards you. 'Anyway, you've been quite silent, pal. How's it hanging on your end?'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The four of you keep talking for some time, and eventually, Brennan decides to keep moving. Erin and Violet take their leave as well after offering you and Brennan a spare soda they salvaged from a vending machine. 'It was like the giving tree: we kept kicking, we kept winning,' Erin tells you. On your own once again, you resume your exploration.";
	say "     Drinking the soda offered by Erin and Violet [bold type]quenched your thirst a little[roman type]. Also, [bold type]you earned an additional soda[roman type].";
