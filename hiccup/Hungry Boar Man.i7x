He is extremely fat with a bald head, floppy ears, and an upturned nose. Flies are constantly buzzing around him, enticed by his foul odor. He has a huge, flabby gut that hangs half way over his crotch, but not far enough to hide a pig cock that is the size of your forearm. Past his cock is a pair of large swollen balls. He seems to take great delight in rolling around in the mud on the floor[if Philip is in Bunker].  He's made a mudhole of his own in one corner of the bunker by breaking a whole in the wall and cracking a pipe.  He and spends much of his time lounging in it[end if].";
