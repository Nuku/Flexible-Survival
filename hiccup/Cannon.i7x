But rather than fire again, it instead pulls your head into its, stuffing you into its wide cum slit. You squirm and struggle feebly, but this seems to only encourage the strange beast as it pushes first your head and then your shoulders down into its cock-like body. It is a slow process[if scalevalue of player > 2], especially at first,[end if] but the slick load clinging to you all over helps lubricate your passage.

Wriggling now with pleasure as you're pulled in, you cum hard, overcome by the oddly arousing experience[end if]. Sliding further in has you deposited in its warm, heavy ballsack where you are bundled up in a gooey chamber filled with its seed. The thick, musky air makes you woozy even as you continue shoveling handfuls of its load into your mouth until you finally pass out in its testicle.";
			say "     Awareness only starts to return in the form of a throbbing around you and the heavy squeezing of the sac enclosing you. Just as you're realizing your current situation, the pressure around you builds up quickly and you are ejected along with a gooey wad of the mutant's semen, launched as a cum-soaked missile at its next victim. You crash into some [one of]canine[or]feline[or]reptile[or]equine[or]bunny[or]rodent[or]humanoid[as decreasingly likely outcomes] creature, bowling it over. By the time you recover from the crash, your target has already started to change, becoming increasingly phallic and making it hard to identify who or what he or she once was. You get up quickly and make your messy escape before you have to deal with another of those penile cannons.";
