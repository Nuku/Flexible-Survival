You crash into some [one of]canine[or]feline[or]reptile[or]equine[or]bunny[or]rodent[or]humanoid[as decreasingly likely outcomes] creature, bowling it over. By the time you recover from the crash, your target has already started to change, becoming increasingly phallic and making it hard to identify who or what he or she once was.

This is the Cock Cannon Infection rule:

		trigger ending "Cock Cannon Infection";
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			say "Lost to your new instincts, you spend the next several days looking for victims to transform. Then the military arrives. Following a compulsion, you climb onto the roof of the nearest building and start stroking your penis-shaped body as fast as you can. The military soldiers don't notice the blobs of cum falling out of the sky from you and the rest of the penile artillery until it is too late.";
		else:
			say "After being rescued by the military, you have trouble fitting in with the rest of society due to the fact that your body is shaped like a giant penis. But then you discover that the infection left many women with pussies so large that nobody could fill them but you...";

Cannon ends here.
