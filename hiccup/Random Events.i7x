Section 1 - The Situations


Wet Clothes is a situation.
the sarea of Wet Clothes is "Warehouse".

Instead of Resolving a Wet Clothes:
	say "     While exploring the city, you discover several small piles of shredded clothes. The clothes, a large part of the sidewalk, and several nearby parked cars are completely soaked in spooge. Whatever did this, sprayed gallons of the stuff everywhere, soaking, and probably mutating, all the humans nearby. You decide to leave before whatever did this 'cums' back.";

Politics is a situation.
the sarea of Politics is "Campus".

Instead of Resolving a Politics:

Failed Survivor is a situation.
the sarea of Failed Survivor is "Junkyard".

Instead of Resolving a Failed Survivor:

	LineBreak;
	say "     Day 1: When the mutants first appeared I took shelter in an old basement for several days, but I can't stand waiting any longer. I'm going to get out of this crazy city!";
	say "     Day 2: Oh god, why did I ever leave the safety of that basement?! As soon as I stepped outside, some strange creature jumped me and started fucking me! I think it impregnated me, which is very distressing because I was a man before it filled me with its seed.";
	say "     Day 3: My pregnant belly has grown huge in an impossibly short amount of time, but I can't worry about that right now. I've been having trouble thinking straight recently and my mind is being filled with dirty fantasies. That's the least of my problems however, because I think that the creature that fucked me yesterday is following me.";
	say "     Day 4: Can't... think straight... must... fuck.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     The rest of the journal is soaked with so much cum that it's unreadable. You discard it.";

Tracks is a situation.
the sarea of Tracks is "Plains".

Instead of Resolving a Tracks:
	say "     While exploring around some collapsing buildings, you discover a short trail of footprints leading through some mud. At first, the footprints are human, but the tracks slowly change until they look like they were made by hooves. You follow the tracks as long as you can, but you eventually lose the trail.";
