# How To Contribute!

## 1. Register on GitHub

https://github.com

## 2. Fork the Flexible-Survival repository
You have to fork the repository (which will duplicate the entire codebase to make a personal version). Click the `Fork` button on the top right of this page:

https://github.com/Nuku/Flexible-Survival

## 3. Download GitHub Desktop
This will let you record your changes and send it up to the GitHub repository for review.

https://github.com/apps/desktop

## 4. Clone your fork of the Flexible-Survival repository
Click `Clone a repository` and it will show you a list of your forked repositories - click on Flexible-Survival and click `Clone`.

## 5. Download Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a text editor that you can use to edit files. There are a couple of useful packages you can install to make life easier!

https://code.visualstudio.com

### a. install the extension `Inform 7` by Natrium729
This will give you syntax highlighting, so you can tell which parts are text that the player can read or commands to make the game move along.

Install packages by going to: Extensions (lefthand bar, or click Ctrl+Shift+X)

### c. install the extension `Live Share`
This package lets you connect to other FS writers and work together in the same file. Great for looking for bugs together!

## 6. Install Inform 7
Install Inform 7! Flexible Survival runs on this game engine. Grab beta "Inform7 6M62 Win64 beta 4" from the following link:

https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Inform7/releases

Note: Only use beta 4 or beta 5. Other versions are incompatible with Flexible Survival!

## 7. Set up the Inform project for the first time
Start Inform and set up "Flexible Survival" as a new project with that exact name! Then close Inform. You only have to do this once.

## 8. Install the Flexible Survival game
Install the Flexible Survival game so you have an interpreter that can read the game files without a lot of hassle.

## 9. Move files for use in Inform7's folders

| Action                      | File/Folder                        | To  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --- |
| Copy the file from the folder `Documents\Github\Flexible-Surival\Inform` | `story.ni` | `Documents\Inform\Projects\Flexible Survival.inform\Source` |
| Create a new folder called  | `Flexible Survival.materials` | `Documents\Inform\Projects\` |
| Copy the folder from the folder `Documents\Github\Flexible-Surival\` | `Figures` | `Documents\Inform\Projects\Flexible Survival.materials` |
| Copy the folders from the folder `Documents\Github\Flexible-Surival\` | Every folder that is not `Figures` or `Inform` | `Documents\Inform\Extensions` |

## 10. Make your changes!
Now whenever you make changes in VSCODE, you should be able to then open Inform and re-compile the game to test it. You can do it in the Inform editor by clicking `Go` or to export it to another interpreter with `Release`. Compiling takes a very long time! Expect to wait 5-20 minutes!

## 11. Compiler Fixes Added 2/3/2025
Please refer to this section if you're having trouble compiling your game through inform 7. Visit the discord at https://discord.com/invite/gZG2nw6 and go to the pin (the pushpin icon at the top of the page) within the FS-Singleplayer channel that starts with 'This pertains to issues with compiling the game through inform 7:'. Follow the steps outlined there and it should fix your compiler!

Don't forget to hit the release button to get your very own gblorb within the release folder in documents>inform>materials>release! (This is the same file type that the FS blog gives you to run the game!) With this you can test all your changes.

## 12. Record your changes and submit a Pull Request!
Open GitHub Desktop and review your changes. Write a summary (i.e. title, like `Adding new scenes to Sarah`) and a longer description listing the types of changes you made. Then click `Commit to master` to save it to your local repository. Click `Push origin` to move your changes from your local repository to your online fork.

Click on Branch -> Create pull request. It will open the GitHub site to compare your fork changes to the official Flexible Survival repository. Click on the `Create pull request` button on the GitHub site.

Then just wait for one of the maintainers to accept your pull request! If it gets accepted, you likely won't have to do anything and you'll see your changes in the next push.
