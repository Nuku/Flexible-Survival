Version 2 of Armed DR by Harry Gates begins here.

"This is just a (no longer) little extension to handle weapons and fighting. Original Armed.i7x by David Ratliff, added damage resistance support by Harry Gates"

Section 1 - The Breath of Life

A person has a number called max health.
A person has a number called present health.
A person can be hostile or docile.
A person is usually docile.
A person has a number called damage resistance.
The damage resistance of a person is usually 1.

The max health of a person is usually 100.
The present health of a person is usually 100.

[When play begins:
	repeat with victim running through people:
		now the present health of the victim is the max health of the victim.]

The max health of player is usually 100.

Definition: a person is dead if his present health < 1.

Definition: a person (called N) is alive if present health of N > 0.

Definition: a person (called N) is injured if present health of N < max health of N.

Definition: a person (called N) is half dead if present health of N < (max health of N / 2).

After printing the name of a dead person (called P) (this is the I see dead people rule):
	if the person is dead for at least 1 turn and P is on-stage, say "[']s dead body" instead.

Section 2 - Rules and Kinds

Definition: a person is armed if he carries a weapon.

Persuasion rule (this is the mine is bigger than yours rule):
	if the player is armed begin;
		if a random chance of 8 in 10 succeeds begin;
			if the person asked is armed begin;
				if a random chance of 8 in 10 succeeds begin;
					say "[The person asked] says 'I am armed, too, and will not be bullied!'" instead;
					persuasion fails;
				end if;
			end if;
			persuasion succeeds;
		end if;
	end if;
persuasion fails.

Check taking (this is the can't take it with you rule):
	if the noun is a thing and the holder of a noun is a person (called corpse) begin;
		if corpse is dead then ignore the can't take people's possessions rule;
	end if.

A weapon is a kind of thing.
A projectile is a kind of weapon.
A blade is a kind of weapon.
A bludgeon is a kind of weapon.
A fire arm is a kind of projectile.
A bow is a kind of projectile.
A knife is a kind of blade.
A sword is a kind of blade.
A club is a kind of bludgeon.

A weapon has a number called maximum damage.
A weapon has a number called minimum damage.

The maximum damage of a projectile is usually 50.
The maximum damage of a blade is usually 25.
The maximum damage of a bludgeon is usually 20.

The minimum damage of a projectile is usually 15.
The minimum damage of a blade is usually 10.
The minimum damage of a bludgeon is usually 8.

Before anyone trying doing anything (this is the dead men tell no tales rule):
if the actor is dead, the rule fails.

Unsuccessful attempt by anyone trying doing anything (this is the report dead men tell no tales rule):
if the person asked is dead, say "Dead men tell no tales. And they usually can't do anything else, either!" instead.

Before doing anything except searching or examining to a person (called the corpse) (this is the respect the dead rule): if the corpse is dead, say "Must you do that to [the corpse]? Have a little respect, please." instead.

Check searching a person (called corpse) (this is the search a corpse rule):
if the corpse is dead, say "You search [corpse][if the number of things carried by corpse is 0] but find nothing[else] and find [the list of things carried by corpse][end if]." instead.

Instead of taking inventory (this is the new inventory listing rule):
if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say "You don't seem to have anything at the moment.[line break](Health: [present health of Player]/[max health of Player])[line break]" instead;
say "You are carrying: [line break]"; list the contents of the player, with newlines, indented; say "(Health: [present health of Player]/[max health of Player])[line break]";

Report examining a person (called victim) (this is the check NPC health rule):
	if the person is not dead, say "(Health: [present health of victim]/[max health of victim])[line break]".

Check examining a dead person (called corpse) (this is the examining a corpse rule):
	say "[Corpse] is a gruesome sight." instead;

Check examining the player (this is the report health rule):
	say "You [status of Player]. (Health: [the present health of Player]/[the max health of Player])[line break]" instead;

To say status of/for (P - a person):
	let x be the present health of P;

Armed DR ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

First I would like to thank Sebastian Rahn for helping me test this update and providing helpful feedback.

This extension is a modified version of Armed.i7x version 3 by David Ratliff, renamed to Armed DR and extended to support damage resistance and bludgeoning weapons by Harry Gates.

Section: Basics of this Extension

This extension adds the actions shooting something with something, clubbing something with something, and stabbing something with something.

Shooting a non-person thing is allowed, but has no real affect on the thing without additional rules. It is possible to make a game where the player has to shoot bottles to win a prize, or even to stop an enemy in a vehicle by shooting the tires.

Stabbing a non-person thing is also allowed, but again does nothing on its own. Again, the uses for this would depend on what the author had need to do with it.

Clubbing a non-person thing is also allowed, but again does nothing on its own. Again, the uses for this would depend on what the author had need to do with it.

Another thing this extension does is add a few kinds: weapon (kind of thing), projectile (kind of weapon), blade (kind of weapon), bludgeon (kind of weapon), fire arm (kind of projectile), bow (kind of projectile), knife (kind of blade), club (kind of bludgeon) and sword (kind of blade). An author can create most any weapon they want using bludgeon, club, fire arm, bow, knife or sword, and they should behave properly.

Lastly, this extension makes it possible for a player holding a weapon to succeed in persuasion up to 80% of the time.

Section: Changes in this Version

The shooting, clubbing and stabbing actions now work for any actor, not just the player.

This version no longer causes instant death when clubbing, shooting or stabbing a person. Everyone starts out with 100 health, and attacks do various damage depending upon the weapon used and random outcomes.

The player can use examine me for information about his or her health.

Taking inventory will also allow the player to see his or her present health.

Examining a NPC will also allow the player to see the present health of the NPC.

If the player clubs, shoots or stabs another actor, that actor will become hostile. Hostile actors will take any weapon available (if there is one) and fight back.

Additionally, a dead person no longer magically vanishes. A dead person, naturally, cannot do anything, and little can be done to a dead person. If the need should arise, however, it is now possible to search the corpse of a fallen enemy, and take anything they may have been carrying.

Example: * Bob Fights Back! - A simple game featuring poor Bob. We can order Bob around (if we carry a weapon), or eliminate Bob. In this example, Bob will grab a weapon (if there is one available) and fight back. Using test commands may not give the desired results, as there is a 20% chance Bob will not do as he is told. After running the test me, one can restart the game to try something different. Trying test Bob will show Bob refusing to be bullied (and with luck, Bob refusing to commit suicide).

		*:"Bob Fights Back!"

		Include Armed DR by Harry Gates

		Use no scoring.

		Hyar is a room. Thar is east of Hyar. A gun is a fire arm in Hyar. Bob is a man in Hyar. A katana is a sword in Thar.

		Test me with "Bob, go east/take gun/Bob, go east/go east/x me/x Bob/shoot Bob with gun/x me/shoot Bob with gun/shoot Bob with gun/shoot Bob with gun/shoot Bob with gun/x me/x Bob/search Bob/take katana"

		Test Bob with "take gun/Bob, go east/go east/Bob, take katana/Bob, drop katana/Bob, stab Bob with katana"

Example: ** Shooting Gallery - Bob invites you to shoot bottles to win a prize! This example is to show why it might be useful to allow a non-person thing to be shot. It shows the report shooting non-people rule being replaced, as well as a simple way to make shooting a non-person thing actually do something.

		*:"Shooting Gallery"

		Include Armed DR by Harry Gates

		Use no scoring.

		When play begins:
			say "A shady looking guy named Bob has convinced you to try your luck at shooting down six bottles with a cork gun. 'If you can do it, I'll give you a teddy bear,' he promises.";

		Shooting gallery is a room.
		A bottle is a kind of thing.
		A table is in shooting gallery.
		Six bottles are on the table.
		A cork gun is a fire arm in shooting gallery.
		Bob is a man in shooting gallery.

		Instead of shooting Bob with the cork gun, say "Bob gives you a frightening stare and says 'You wouldn't stand a chance even if that thing were real!'".

		Instead of doing anything to Bob, say "He glares at you and says 'Just see if you can shoot all the bottles.'"

		The report shooting non-people rule is not listed in any rulebook.

		After shooting a bottle with something: remove the noun from play; continue the action.

		Report shooting a bottle with something: say "POP! goes the cork gun. SHATTER! goes the bottle. Bob says '[bottles message]!'"

		To say bottles message:
		let x be the number of bottles on the table;
		if x is 5:
			say "Only 5 more to go";
		else if x is 4:
			say "Only 4 more";
		else if x is 3:
			say "Half way there";
		else if x is 2:
			say "Just 2 more";
		else if x is 1:
			say "Only 1 more and you win";
		else:
			say "You shot all of the bottles! You win the teddy bear";
			end the story saying "You should give your newly won teddy bear to someone you love!".

		Test me with "x Bob/take cork gun/shoot Bob with cork gun/shoot a bottle with cork gun/shoot a bottle with cork gun/shoot a bottle with cork gun/shoot a bottle with cork gun/shoot a bottle with cork gun/shoot a bottle with cork gun"

Example: *** Trolls - Bob, king of the trolls, must be destroyed! This example shows how easy it is to override some of the values used by Armed, such as max health and maximum damage, as well as how to make a NPC always want to attack the player on sight. Additionally, this example shows a simple way to create something to restore health to the player.

		*:"Trolls"

		Include Armed DR by Harry Gates

		Use no scoring.

		A crossbow is a bow. Description of the crossbow is "An old crossbow. It still functions, but only barely." The maximum damage of the crossbow is 25.

		A sharpened bone is a kind of knife. The maximum damage of a sharpened bone is 15.

		A thing called the old rusty sword is a sword.

		A potion is a kind of thing.

		Instead of drinking a potion:

		Forrest is a room. Description of forest is "A lush forest. In front of you is a cave. A peculiar odor wafts out from the cave. Strangely, you neither see nor here any animals. Will you go in?" The crossbow and one potion are here.

		Cave is a room. Cave is inside from forest. Description of cave is "A dank cave. It smells rather like trolls." A troll called a tall troll is in cave.

		Passage is north of cave. The description is "A narrow passage leading deeper into the cave." A troll called a short troll is here. It carries two potions.

		Throneroom is west of passage. The description is "This is the throneroom of Bob the troll king." Bob is a troll in throneroom. The max health of Bob is 70. Bob is docile. Bob carries the old rusty sword.

		After going to throneroom for the first time:
			say "Bob the troll king looks at you and says 'I am the troll king. Leave now or I will punish you for killing my followers!'";

		Every turn:
			if Bob is dead, end the story saying "You have slain Bob, king of the trolls!".
