Section - Rooms

Approaching the Capitol Building is a Room. "The air here has grown thick with smoke and dust, kicked up by the constant scuffles and the fires. Along the street are the skeletal hulls of cars and many other vehicles which have been burnt out. The structures of the area are all partially collapsed, broken buildings, they look like giants have fought amidst them. To north you see the capitol building, standing above the wreckage of surrounding skyscrapers, the lower tall lit up by surround flames. The whole structure is wreathed in smoke. Either some miracle, or dark magic has kept the building from falling".

The Charred Streets is a Room. "The damage to the roads and the buildings grow worse as you approach the capitol building. Most of the buildings here are semi-recognizable. You see what once may have been a designer underwear shop now burnt out with the windows smashed. You also spot one of your favourite video game retailers, what used to be a small family business, the storefront is totally wrecked. You jump over a ditch in the middle of the street, it is flooded, a water main nearby must have been cracked.".

The The Path of Ashes is a Room. "The air here is thick with stinging smoke and ash. The worst of it seems to be drifting from the hellish capitol building itself. To your west you see standing buildings in somewhat good repair. Some structures are hung between them, over the street. To the east few buildings partially stand, some major landmark must be in that direction. You resolve to move in any direction, as the thick air settles around you. Rubble blocks the way to capitol building, perhaps it will be cleared in time.".

The A Volcanic Crater is a Room. "Before is a enormous circular pit. It looks almost as if a meteor landed here, yet there is no trace of any debris. Lava and magma ooze into the pits lower reaches. Close to the craters lowest point you see the entrance way to a tunnel system. The heat is from the open magma is very intense and your nanites struggle to adapt your perspiration and breathing to better cope with the primordial scene.".
East of The Path of Ashes is A Volcanic Crater

instead of sniffing A Volcanic Crater:
	say "The smell of smoke, soot and volcanic gasses is particularly strong here.";

The Rusty Walkways is a Room. "Rusty makeshift bridges hang between the tall buildings here. Constructed from scavenged metal and parts there are scattered little shelters inside the buildings or on the street. As you walk down the road the bridges cast an ominous web like shadow over you. Occasionally you swear you see something or someone darting out of view each time you turn a corner. Whatever feral civilization exists here, it may be based out of the old stadium which is west.".

Instead of resolving Wolfrape:
	say "While searching the city you hear sounds of ecstasy floating from a nearby alleyway. Cautiously you approach and peer inside. An anthro white wolf female has been caught and pinned by one of the herm Drakenoids. The demonic features of the reptile herm contrast the clean pure coloration of the white wolf woman. The wolf moans pitifully, an expression of rapture on her face as the Drakenoid drills into her from behind. The dragon growls and slams her prick home causing the Wolf to yelp then struggle, then become very still. The lizard cock glows from within the wolfs belly and soon you can tell the canine is being filled with molten sperm. The white wolfs belly expands as it is filled, and glows red as its new cargo of life shine through her skin. Cautiously you back away.";

Instead of resolving dragatorspot:
	say "Down the street you spot a crocodile like beast. It is black with six legs, one of the Ash Broods Dragators. You watch it with sympathy as it knocks over trash cans and uses its huge jaws and teeth to rummage through the refuse. Such a stupid unclean creature is easily avoided.";

Instead of resolving Whelpspot:
	say "A shadow darts overhead and instinctively you dive for cover. Hiding in an abandoned auto you watch worriedly while a flock of Ash Dragon whelps swoops overhead. They do not linger long, heading off in the direction of the capitol building.";
