	say "     Figuring that you may as well go see how the Viking and the Spartan-Helot are getting along, hoping that they haven't murdered each other. Er, at the very least you hope that Pericles hasn't maimed Bjorn. So, you make your path towards your Greek friend's room in the male dorms. As you head there though, you notice that the guardians of the college, the Spartans seem to be in a bit of tense mood, some of them whispering and passing along photos to observe to each other. You however shrug to yourself, deciding that it's not your problem at the moment, continuing onto Dorm Street where you head on into the male residential hall.";
	say "     Going on up the stairs, a few seconds later you're looking at the door to Pericles['] room. Knocking like usual, you hear the sounds of metal clanging and clothes ruffling before the padding of shoes over towards the door, which promptly opens soon after. To your surprise it's Bjorn who answered it, giving you a smile when he sees that it's you at the doorway. 'Hey there! Come on in,' the Viking says with a slight pant to his breath. Raising a brow at that you glance up and down at his appearance and notice that it's ruffled and he's sweating but there's also some cuts at his clothing. So you don't know if they were doing anything... sexual or just sparring, or both. It is Bjorn after all.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     When you see Pericles you notice that he's in a similar state of appearance. Rolling your eyes slightly you give them both a smile. At least your Spartan-Helot friend appears to have gotten over his irritations concerning Bjorn. While it could be considered rather quick to some people, you do know that the Viking was very eager to ease relations with the Greek warrior. So his determination probably helped with softening the other's demeanor. Before you or them could say anything, a Spartan came rushing in through the door. 'General! We have a problem!' he shouts, standing at attention, not looking straight at Pericles.";
	say "     Looking a bit shocked but quickly easing his expression, your Greek friend assumes an authoritative aura. 'At ease soldier, what's the issue?' he asks, clearly wanting to get to the base of the issue. The soldier relaxes his stance and nods, pulling out photos from a pouch on a belt that you just noticed he was wearing. Once he has handed them over to his leader he starts speaking, explaining them. 'Earlier, shortly after the training session that... the Viking took part in, we started spotting people at the outskirts of the campus. They appeared to be similar in appearance to him when he first showed up here, both men and women,' he says, pointing to each photo.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As the soldier is saying this, Pericles is furrowing his brows, clearly wondering where this is going but Bjorn has a slightly worried look on his face. It was with the next sentence though that all color vanished from the viking's face. 'It was, however, a few minutes ago that we barely managed to protect students lounging at the fountain area as a barrage of flaming arrows were sent careening from far outside the entrance. It was shortly afterwards that a lone projectile pierced one of the trees that we retreated to. Attached to it was this missive,' he says, handing over a folded piece of paper. Taking it, Pericles unfolds it and reads the message out loud. 'For the insult of kidnapping one of our own and holding them hostage without ransom or honor we, the Vikings of the Southern Bay declare war on your puny community. May Odin have no mercy on thee,' he says, scoffing at the end.";
	say "     By now Bjorn has slumped on couch in the corner that you just notice, figuring that Pericles must have recently acquired it. 'These wretches dare threaten our charges?' the Spartan-Helot seethes, the anger clear in his voice. However, to your surprise the rage vanishes as soon as it arrived, a calm look coming to your friend's face. 'No, I need to stay focused and quickly plan for battle. Comrade, I'm expecting you to assist us, as if the campus falls, then the chaos of the city may accelerate far more than anyone can control,' the Greek warrior says to you. You sigh and nod, understanding very well what he means, if a place as large as the college were to succumb to baser instincts rapidly, it may as well be the equivalent of a nanite bomb.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As soon as you nod though, Bjorn stands up, a determined look on his face. 'I'll fight too!' he yells, causing you to perk a brow at him. Pericles however shakes his head at this. 'No, they're looking for you so there is no reason for you to be out in the middle of everything,' he says firmly. That just causes the Viking to sputter and glare. 'Why not! I deserve a right to fight and protect this place!' the young male shouts, giving an indignant air to him. 'Because! If they get you then there's nothing stopping them from being reckless in their attacks. I'm not taking no for an answer,' the Spartan-Helot says, returning the stubborn response with a stern look.";
	say "     He redirects his attention to you, quickly instructing you. 'I believe that they'll attack the gym first as it is one of the most outer buildings and the least protected. They shouldn't arrive for probably an hour but I'll plan as we go otherwise. As for you, have your fellow soldiers come in here for orders,' Pericles says, aiming the last bit towards the Spartan in the room. You both nod at the instructions. You turn around and head off, preparing yourself for the war to come.";

That appears to make his grin widen even more as he replies with a request for you to visit him sometime perhaps, either at his room or the frat.

You proceed to keep at tossing the dumbbells but as you do this you notice that you're starting to run out of ammo. Getting a determined look on your face, you dash forward towards the remaining Vikings. Throwing your fist forward, you land an uppercut into one of the warrior's chins.

In fact a few of them are hurriedly heading this way towards you. As they near closer to you, a series of thoughts run through your head as you wonder what you're going to do.

From every member of the various sports teams to even the more rowdy frats the Spartan-Helot leader has acquired quite a few people to defend the campus. Walking up to your friend you give him a smile which he returns, albeit in a more serious form. 'It's nice to see you, I was definitely hoping to see you here,' he says, nodding in your direction. You hum and ask him where Bjorn is as you doubt he'd miss this battle for anything. 'I told him to stay in my room and left two Spartans guarding the doors,' he informs you gesturing in the direction of the dorms.";
	say "     Soon enough though you guys hear a warcry near the outskirts of the campus which causes everyone to turn and get on guard. Quickly after, a large force of Vikings come pouring through the entrance which is met in response by your side charging forward. Following after everyone you launch forward with a punch at one of the enemies, managing to catch them in the cheek but you have to rapidly duck to avoid a haymaker. Thankfully though, one of your allies gets rid of the enemy who swung at you from behind by practically slam dunking them on the head.

However, out of the corner of your eyes you recognize someone who shouldn't be here.";

Though quite quickly your expression turns to horror as you see the friendly Viking knocked to the ground and one of the enemies raise their weapon to hit him while he's down. Normally the nanites would heal almost any wound but the one the Norse warrior was aiming for looked to be instantly fatal. Looking at the Spartan-Helot you notice him dashing towards Bjorn, causing you to quickly re-evaluate your position.

Letting out a groan as the nanites begin to slowly stitch your skin back together, which you'll forever be thankful for as healing the slow way would be a pain in the ass. As you look over to where Pericles is, you see that he has an angry look on his face and he readies his sword before dashing forward at the remaining enemies.";
		say "     What you end up witnessing could be compared to nothing less than a massacre, just with unconscious bodies. The Spartan-Helot charges from enemy to enemy and incapacitates them, moving with the grace of a dancer, making you think that if he wasn't wearing the armor it'd be hard to think of him as a Spartan, though he does take hits, causing pieces of his armor to come off. It doesn't take long before most if not all of the Vikings are on the ground. Once this is done, Pericles stands tall and glares at all of them before speaking. 'You all will surrender and sign a peace treaty with us, is that clear?' he asks coldly, his tone booking no argument. The one seemingly leading all the Norse warriors reluctantly nods at the practical order.";

'You did... but I didn't want you to fight alone!' he shouts, a stubborn look on his face. This just causes the Spartan-Helot to sigh and turn to you, nodding when he sees that your wounds have fully healed by now. 'So, I think I'll have the treaty signing in the library. When you're ready come and see it, I have some things to discuss with you,' he says before grabbing the Viking by the arm and heading off. You raise your brow but shrug then leave as well.";

When your friend pushes Bjorn out of the way he takes a slash to the back that seems to cut through his armor, falling to the ground in pain, but not severely crippled, as the nanites do heal injuries. Bjorn however looks extremely pissed when you turn your stare on him and he launches himself at the other Viking. 'Do. Not. Attack. My. Friends!' he roars, embellishing each word with a punch, the last one sending the enemy flying practically. One of the other Norse warriors sneers at him, speaking up. 'Why should we listen to you traitor?' she asks, clearly not a fan of him. Calmly he picks up Pericles['] sword and holds it firmly in his hands.";

As you do this, you watch as Bjorn dashes forward and clashes weapons with his former fellow Vikings. At first it appears that he's at a disadvantage but you then notice him take a stance that's very familiar to you, one that you've seen the Spartans and Pericles take before. Right as he slides into this form he quickly has advantage over his enemies, disarming and incapacitating them with sheer utter force. When he manages to disarm and knock down the largest of the Vikings, he glares at them all. 'Surrender, now!' he growls, his attitude reminiscent of Pericles when he's in Spartan mode.";

'I think I'll have them sign a peace treaty in the library,' he says with a grunt before turning to you. 'I'd appreciate it if you could be there, as I do have some things to talk to you about,' the Greek male says nodding in your direction.
