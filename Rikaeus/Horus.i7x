		say "     While exploring the High Rise District something catches your sight in the corner of your eyes. It moves past your vision and into a building nearby. Out of interest you make your way towards where you saw it, coming face to face with what you believe to be the largest skyscraper in the city. Shrugging your shoulders you pull open the door and head on in. The inside is rather normal, as it appears to be your average office building, though completely abandoned. Looking around a bit more you notice that it used to be an office space for bank companies, though not much of one as there was a notice on the door saying the connection to the power grid was cut.";
		say "     You don't have much time to continue searching because soon enough to your shock, lights on the floor brighten up, creating a path for you. Slightly weirded out by it due to the notice on the door, you nevertheless follow it, wondering where it's taking you to. It actually doesn't take long for you to arrive where it wants you to go, as it actually leads you to an elevator of all things. Glancing at it wearily you watch as the doors open up as if beckoning you on inward. With trepidation on your mind you take the steps forward required to enter the boxed lift, it closing behind you as you get in.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The trip up the building is a quiet one besides the whir of the elevator as it moves, however, it gives you time to observe where the lift is taking you. Eyes widening a bit when you look at how many floors there were, a whopping total of seventy-three floors, not including the two below ground parking lots, you notice that it's slowly moving you higher and closer to the sky. A couple minutes later, a sound dings and you see the doors open up at, to your shock, the top floor. Even then, there are lights leading you towards a door that has stairs going up, to what you're assuming the roof.";
		say "     Going up the stairs you are indeed led straight to the roof, however, it doesn't appear to end there. No, you see a set of glowing steps going higher into the sky, despite the fact that you're already above the clouds. Believing that you have nowhere else to really go, you head on upward, feeling a force take hold of you, giving sensations as if preventing you from falling. Which is nice, as these stairs appear not to have railings. It takes a few minutes but as the time goes by you notice something in the distance getting closer, appearing to be a decently sized ornate building made of sandstone sitting on a cloud floating in the sky with the sun behind it.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     From your trips to the Egyptian Wing, it actually looks awfully like a Pharaoh's palace in design and materials, which makes you wonder who or what is leading you to this place. Soon enough you get to the stone stairs leading up to the pillared overhang above the large open entrance. Once close you can confirm your earlier thought, as the outside is etched with various hieroglyphics, which would perpetuate this as an Egyptian building. You're pretty sure that whatever is calling you here wants you to head on in, and from how out of the way it is, it should be safe, so with a shrug of your shoulders you walk through the doorway.";
		say "     The entrance hall of the palace actually appears to be rather averagely decorated for a place of royalty. To your surprise there are falcon humanoids walking around. However, they look to be ignoring you, so instead you glance around the place, seeing a couple doorways leading to various areas of the building, but what catches your attention is another huge open entrance. Assuming that this is where you're supposed to be going, you head on further in. When you enter, your assumptions are slowly eased, as you believe it to be the Pharaoh's throne room. With the hieroglyphics all over the room and the fancy murals and carpet you draw your attention to the stone throne at the back of the room.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Sitting in the throne is at first what looks to be a normal human male, that is until you get to the head of the guy. Instead of a face of a homo-sapien he has the head of a falcon, which would make him stand out if you compared him to any regular person you know. Clothing wise he was not wearing any shirt, revealing a muscled-olive toned body wearing a gold necklace with a familiar jade scarab. He was wearing what looked to you to be a skirt, though a flash of memory from the Egyptian Wing tells you it's a shendyt, which is more of a kilt than anything. It appears to be made of fancy soft cotton, which you're sure feels super comfortable.";
		say "     Drawing your attention elsewhere for a moment you look above him first and notice another familiar item, a sun disk, that you sure you recall retrieving for Amuran, servant of Horus. Above it is a very fancy looking eye framed on the wall. Turning back to the man you notice he is holding a staff in his hand, with... something that cements an idea of who he is in your mind. It is a golden rod with a similar metallic ankh mounted at the tip, said item you recognize very clearly. Having finished your once over you walk over to the falcon-headed man and wait for him to speak.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'I am glad that you decided to follow my guidance here friend of my servant,' the olive-skinned male says with a soft smile in your direction. You joke and say that it was a pretty straightforward guide with the lights and everything. 'Yes, well, sometimes one has to be direct in order to get another's attention,' he says with a chuckle. 'I'm sure you have recognized me as Horus, from your interactions with Amuran which brings me to another topic, why I've brought you here,' the now-confirmed God says, hunching forward with steepled fingers. You nod, as you had wondered why all the effort was done to bring you up here.";
		say "     'When I regained the first of my items due to your assistance, I had sensed a growing darkness. At first I wasn't entirely sure where it was due to not having all my objects of power,' Horus says before standing up and starting to pace. 'However, when I got back the Ankh I finally was able to locate it and could feel how much of a threat it was to this area,' the God says, finally turning back to you. Nodding at what he has been saying, you ask what it has to do with you. 'Well, with how well you did in retrieving my items I was hoping that you could help me in this delicate matter,' the Sun deity says, with what you swear is a sheepish look.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     With a sigh you look around a bit. From how it sounds, it appears that the trouble brewing is going to be rather difficult to overcome. You're not entirely sure if you want to get involved at the moment. But at the same time you can understand that if nothing gets involved with it, it might proceed further and become even more of a problem, thus possibly hurting all of the city, which despite from what you've seen hasn't entirely recovered from the apocalypse. It was a tough decision to make, and one that you weren't sure you were able to make one about at all.";
		say "     Before you can even say anything however, Horus sends you a soft smile, and speaks up. 'Young one, I am not called the God of Kingship for nothing. I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to make so hastily,' The Sun Deity says before looking in the direction of one of the falcon mutants. 'I would never ask that of my subjects, which I consider all those who bathe in the light of day or in the wind of the sky,' he says firmly, giving a resolute tone. That actually causes you to smile at him in return. 'If wish to help me then simply speak with me more on the Darkness, otherwise you may spend as much time here as you wish,' Horus says, waving his hand as if to gesture to the entire palace. Nodding, you happily accept his offer.";

From what you saw when you took a much closer look at the entranceway, it had various tapestries hung all over the place, but in a decently put manner. However, each of the pieces of textile had the image of a person on it. What was unique though, was that some looked human a few with features like Horus, a lot of them actually looked like some of the mutants that you saw on the streets below, leaving you to wonder who they were. The Throne Room was a lot less decorated in the sense of objects, instead hieroglyphics were carved all over the place along with murals. Despite this though, it didn't make it any less wondrous.";

Horus is olive skinned for the most part, wearing an Egyptian-like kilt that appears to be made of the finest and softest cotton that could be found, assuredly looking comfortable. Beyond that, he appears to be wearing no other piece of clothing, opting for simply a golden necklace with a jade scarab attached to it. As for the problem of the above neck variety, the male has the head of a falcon, which definitely separates him from other humans.

'I'm doubting you know much about the concept of Gods as a reality rather than just a thought process for religion am I right?' he asks, tilting his head in your direction. You nod, admitting that much to the deity. 'Originally we all were mortals just like you who were granted power beyond our belief, some through circumstances of birth others through magic,' he starts, gesturing to some of the murals, one of them showing a woman resurrecting a man temporarily to conceive a child. Another showed a man appearing out of nowhere and seemingly helping out people as they progress in their lives.";
	say "     'However, that power is not without a consequence, it ebbs and flows with strength based on belief and the thought of us,' Horus says, adjusting his position. 'Now, belief is the strongest, but thoughts work just as well. For me I function off the belief of my followers and the fact that my myth is very prevalent in the world,' he says with a look towards one of the falcon-looking beings. You nod at all this information but ask him something, what does it have to do with the Ra, who as far as you remember from the Egyptian Wing, holds the title of God of the Sun.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Ah, that. Well, the consequence of our power being influenced by belief and thought is that if a large amount of people were to think something differently of us, it would change us,' Horus says with a sigh. 'Which comes to the current topic. Somewhere along the later years of the Ancient Egyptian era, a large amount of them got the belief that Horus and Ra were the same person, known as Ra-Horakhty,' he says, rubbing his forehead. 'This ended up influencing both Horus and Ra and merging them into one entity.' The deity then gestures to himself.";
	say "     With one last question before you leave the God be, you ask him why he chooses the name Horus over Ra or simply Horakhty? 'Ah, well, that choice was all mine and had to do with how a vast majority of my followers appeared to prefer it over the others,' Horus explains with a chuckle. That makes you smile before nodding at the explanation. Deciding that you've gained enough information you tell him that you'll let him return him to whatever he was doing. He chuckles and nods at you before turning his attention and voice towards one of the various falcon beings around you guys.";

	if HorusRelationship is 1:

'I'm glad that you've agreed to help me despite the dangers to you,' he says with happiness in his voice. Standing up promptly you get your first show of he God's power since you've arrived here as he waves his hands and a projection of an area with cracks that spew ash and magma. From the angle you can tell that it's an overview of the area rather than a view from the ground. But overall you are able to understand where this projection is looking at.";
		say "     'The darkness seems to have taken root in the ruins of what remains of the mortal's government area. However, I am unable to actually get a lock onto where it is,' Horus tells you with a sigh. You tilt your head at this, shouldn't he be able to easily find anything with his power? This in turn causes the deity to shake his own at you. 'Not really. I think whatever the problem is, it's constantly shifting its body. That usually prevents me from getting a good read on someone.' The Sun Deity shifts in his throne as he says this. 'I want you to go there and for now, get a closer look at what it is, don't get too in over your head,' Horus kindly says, concern in his voice. You promise him you won't, preparing yourself for what you have to do.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Before you can leave however, the Sun God stops you. 'I must impart you some last information about the enemy at hand,' he says as he waves his hand again causing the image to disappear. 'Whatever the darkness is, it appears to only target relatively strong people. As, no offense to my servants, whenever I sent any of them to go scout the area, any of the well-trained ones never came back,' Horus informs you, causing you to wonder what exactly this thing is. You nod and hope inwardly you're strong enough to attract its attention, despite the shudder that runs through your body as you think of that as you let him return to his business.";
		now Nightmare Mutation is active;
		now HorusRelationship is 2;
	else if HorusRelationship is 2:
		say "     Horus gives you a confused look, possibly wondering why you're still here. 'Young one, why haven't you gone to the place where the darkness is located? Does something have you concerned?' he asks, his face changing to one of worry. You assure him that you're alright and that you are going to head to the capitol area soon. He smiles at that, nodding before speaking. 'Please be quick, this enemy could be devastating for the city,' the Deity requests of you, before returning to what he was doing.";
	else if HorusRelationship is 3:
		say "     With a resolute look you pull the cloth out and unwrap it slightly, showing the wriggling piece of whatever it is to Horus. As soon as it catches the deity's eyes they widen in shock and he kind of backs up in his seat in horror. 'That's... worse than what I was thinking. I was hoping for a better situation than this,' he says, muttering the last sentence. You ask him, with a hopeful tone, if he knows what it is, describing what you had fought and what it had done. The terrifying scene was still front facing in your mind and probably will for a while. He shakes his head and lets out a sigh before speaking.";
		say "     'I don't know exactly what it is, as it appears to be of nanite origins. Which despite being a deity we aren't omniscient, no we get our knowledge like everyone else, just at an easier learning curve,' he says, groaning a few seconds later and rubbing his forehead. 'The reason I said it's worse than what I was thinking is because I can feel its intent, or emotions so to speak. And that thing appears to be ravenously hungry for food and power,' Horus explains, causing you to nod, understanding his earlier reaction with a better point of view.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Suddenly though the Sun Deity gets a look on his face that makes you think that he had an idea. 'I think we might be able to solve this issue, but there's one problem,' Horus says, sighing at the end. You raise a brow at him and ask what it is, surely it isn't too hard? He shakes his head and leans back into the throne, crossing his hands in his lap. 'If we had a knowledgeable doctor who could examine this sample, we might be able to find a way to beat it. But sadly, the last one I knew was millennia ago,' he says with another groan. Perhaps you could find someone that can look it over? You voice this to the God and he gives you a thankful look. 'I'd appreciate that, now I must explain the situation to my servants, I apologize,' he says, turning his attention towards the falcon beings.";

	say "     With a certain person in mind to help you two, you begin to speak. In no short length you explain to the deity that you have had the decency of meeting a pediatric doctor named Doctor Medea. As soon as you mention her job description, Horus looks at you with confusion. 'I don't know how someone trained in the way of helping someone giving birth would help us here,' he says rather confused about your suggestion. You roll your eyes at Horus and tell him that you really don't have a better idea. Plus, you guys might get lucky and she might have experience researching things. With a sigh he shrugs his shoulders before speaking. 'Well, we don't have much to lose,' the God says with a shake of his head.";
	say "     He turns to one of his servants and for the first time you notice that he switches languages. It's an old language, that much is for sure, but the bird-headed male definitely understands him. After a minute they turn and leave the room. 'I want you to approach this woman with a request to examine the material,' Horus says to you before turning in the direction of the other person returning quite quickly. In their hands is a petri dish, more than likely containing the wriggling sample of whatever you fought before. You accept it with a nod, before carefully putting it somewhere safe so that it wouldn't break open. 'When you get news, come let me know,' the Sun God says with a comforting smile, one that you return before you leave.";

Now you can finally finish the fight against the darkness encroaching upon us,' he says. You nod and say that you'll make sure to take care of it as soon as possible. Inwardly you hope that the cure works as you don't know what other solution there is. Turning around you let the deity get back to his work.";

A little bit of the cum has been cleaned up and some of the shattered cushions have been stacked up against the wall, but other than that it looks the same. However your goal isn't in this part of the building, but rather the secure looking door at the other end. That's where Doctor Medea resides, the only pediatric doctor that remains in this facility. Feeling around for where you put the petri dish and sensing that it's there you let out a breath of relief before steeling yourself and walking forward and knocking on the door.";
		say "     'Come in!' A familiar voice resonates from behind the door, resulting in you turning the handle and opening the door. Upon entering you can see that Medea looks a bit ruffled but still presentable. Sitting herself on her chair she turns your way and gives you her best professional look and speaks. 'So, what brings you to my office today?' she asks with a tilted head. Looking a little nervous you grasp a hold of the petri dish though the doctor seems to come to the wrong assumptions. '[if player is male]Did you get someone pregnant? [else if player is female]Did someone get you pregnant? [else]Do you need someone to talk to? [end if]I can help you, you know?' she says with a smile on her face, though the smile seems rather sultry. You shake your head rather profusely and say it's something else entirely, which seems to intrigue her nonetheless.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Rather quickly you pull out the petri dish and present it to her, causing her to look at it curiously. 'What's this supposed to be?' she asks, taking it from you and looking at the writhing mass from all angles. You quickly explain how you got it and the horrifying monster that it came from. There's a slightly disturbing inquisitive gaze on her face as she stares at it with the new information you've given her. Though you can see a slightly horrified look as well, so that eases the weirdness. 'So, what made you think to bring this to a Pediatrics Doctor of all things?' Medea asks, tilting her head at you rather questioningly.";
		say "     You admit that you didn't have many options as the person you're working with doesn't know many scientists or doctors anymore. However, you knew of her and that there was the smallest chance that she could know a way to learn of something from it, even if it was one in a million. With a sigh, she leans back, setting the dish on the counter. 'Well, you're in luck, I just so happen to actually have a degree in genetic engineering and research,' Medea says, causing you to give her a look of shock. The excitable doctor appears to have dropped all pretenses, adopting a rather serious persona, which you guess fits, given the situation.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'As for how I have these degrees when I'm a Pediatrics Doctor, well...' she says, trailing off at the end. 'About a couple years ago, before the nanites, I was a geneticist for children,' Medea says, causing you to look at her in confusion. 'I'm not surprised you don't know what it is. They're not particularly common, but their job is to examine children and understand what birth defects or possible other health developmental problems they can have and then treat it somehow,' Medea explains, clearly reminiscing about something. Having an idea of what it is you speak up, asking if something went wrong. The lizard-woman gives a self-deprecating smile and nods.";
		say "     'I ended up getting attached to one of the kids, a sweet little baby boy who I found out had Tay-Sachs, a genetic disorder that ended up never letting him reach school age,' Medea says, tears running down her face before promptly wiping them off.

'Well, when I first moved here a while back, I heard of a geneticist named Jeremiah, so I looked into his work and the sample shows traces of it,' the lizardwoman says. You quickly ask the doctor if he could have done this on purpose and she hurriedly shakes her head. 'No, he was a kind man, intent on solving many diseases. I can tell you where his research area was though,' she says. You thank her for her help, to which Medea just smiles and says it was no problem as you helped her in turn.

However, when the nanites hit, he began to experiment with the various infections however as the notes go on you see that there was an accident in the lab. In a fit of clumsiness he knocked over a shelf and spilled a whole lot of vials of nanites and it appeared to have corrupted his own nanites.";

Promptly she takes the vial and walks over to you, placing it into your hand. 'So, I'm hoping that this will work. It contains Jeremiah's original nanites. If you manage to defeat him again, pour this onto him and it MIGHT just revert his transformation, if the nanites are smart enough to remember his original form,' Medea says with a sigh.
