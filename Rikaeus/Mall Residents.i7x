[Room Declaration]
Southwest of Mall West Wing is Mall Lockerroom.
The description of Mall Lockerroom is "[MallLockerroomDesc]".

to say MallLockerroomDesc:
	say "     The lockerroom that you're standing in is rather big with simple dark blue walls. Bright red lockers fill the room in rows, some appearing to be open, others closed and locked. There is a variety of empty chip bags and empty water bottles littering the room, showing evidence that people live here. Of course, that's not the only thing that proves that there's life here as you can hardly miss the random sleeping bags placed all throughout the room. While the place is pretty messy, you figure it's a lot better than looking like a ghost town, much like most of the places you've seen before.";

	if LockerroomTrioRelationship is 0: [first time]
		say "     While wandering the mall you notice that an inconspicuous door with a sign 'Employees Only' standing open a little, just leaned-to. This door had always been closed (and presumably locked) in your visits to the place before all this chaos - which draws you closer in curiosity. The fact that sounds - multiple voices, murmuring and laughing - are coming from beyond does increase your interest further, and so you reach for it and pull the door open as soon as you reach it. On the other side, you are met with the sight of one of the mall's multiple employee locker rooms. Lockers are lined all along the wall on both sides - but those actually aren't what caches your attention right away.";
		say "     No, the most interesting thing to see in the room are a number of sleeping bags stretched out on the floor, and currently occupied by a mall-rat plus an anthro wolf and feline, sitting cross-legged on the fabric. That is an interesting trio of people right there. Seems that they've moved in and made camp in this room - as have many other refugees from the city that fled to the mall, taking up stores, rooms and sometimes even the hallways themselves as their new quarters. Although, it appears that there are more occupants as there are more sleeping bags lined up against the walls. Even so, the sounds that you heard must have come from these guys, as the trio is embroiled in a game of cards, with the mall-rat obviously losing. The whole scene makes you smile as it serves as proof that the entire world hasn't gone completely crazy yet, if these three can enjoy a simple card game. Not wanting to interrupt their friendly banter and play, you quietly close the door after watching for a little while and head on your way.";
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     It might be worth checking back here sometime later, maybe you can get to know the inhabitants or join them for a game or other interesting past-times...";
		now LockerroomTrioRelationship is 1; [met the trio once]
	else if LockerroomTrioRelationship is 1: [second time]
		say "     You decide to finally go back and check on the trio. When you enter the lockerroom you're kind of surprised to only see two of them, the wolf and the feline. Your entrance is noticed by one of the two, specifically the cat who waves you on over. Intrigued, you make walk closer, reaching the pair in seconds. Upon a closer look, you see that the feline's fur is a bluish gray color and that he has eyes that are quite vividly green. As for the wolf - he has tan fur and a gray muzzle, his eyes a simple brown. The cat chuckles and turns his head to face his roommate. 'Hey, Spike! Looks like we got someone new here,' he says happily. The canine rolls his eyes at his friend. 'I can clearly see that Tomas, I'm not blind,' Spike says exasperatedly. 'Hey, I don't know about that. I mean you did run into that wall that-' Tomas starts before being cut off with a hand to the mouth. Spike glares at his friend, a blush on his cheeks. 'I thought I told you never to speak of that again?' he growls.";
		say "     The bluish-gray cat just shakes his head with a laugh before removing the hand and turning his face to you. 'Alright, alrighty... Anyhow, who are you? As you've probably heard I'm Tomas and this is Spike,' he says with a smile. You tell the feline that you're just a survivor who wanted to see if the two of them and the mall-rat were there. Seeing the two give a confused look as to how you knew of them, you tell them that you saw them playing cards. That brings recognition to both of their eyes as the wolf lets out a chuckle. 'I remember that! I cleaned both you and Jeremy out real good,' Spike says to Tomas.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     This appears to make the feline rather embarrassed if the fidgeting was anything to go by. 'I know, I know, me and Jeremy suck at poker! You don't need to rub it in,' he pouts. You assume that Jeremy is the mall-rat that you saw, as there had been no other person there when you saw them playing poker. So, instead you end up asking the two where Jeremy is. 'Jeremy? Last I know he went to go try to get more supplies,' the feline says, looking at Spike. 'Yeah, I remember that too,' the wolf says nodding. Seconds later, out of nowhere, a lizard-morph you haven't seen before comes running into the room. She must be another occupant of the room, besides the guys you already have met. Panting a little, she quickly tells the two that Jeremy was caught stealing food. This prompts both to curse rather vocally. 'Shit! Not again, doesn't he learn!?' Spike shouts, running off. Only Tomas has the thought to turn to you before he does the same. 'I'm sorry for this rather short conversation but we do need to save our friend,' he says before darting out of the room, the lizard following behind.";
		say "     Your curiosity is spiked so you dash on after them. It looks like your chase takes you to the Mall Foyer where the Wolverine Guard station is. It's there that you spot Spike and Tomas arguing quite vehemently with the guards. To the left of the two arguing, you spot a familiar mall-rat being man-handled by a guard into lock up, resisting heavily with a large variety of swear words. You try to make your way over to assist or at the very least get a better listen in on the argument. However, it appears that the crowds are too thick with people, making it near impossible. By the time that you can get through, the two are gone, with no clue as to where they went. With a look towards where the rat is locked up at, you think about talking to him but decide against it. The look on his face says that if you were to talk to him, he'd probably snap and direct his anger at you as a scapegoat. So, instead you decide to go about your business, making a mental note to check in the lockerroom at a later time.";

		say "     Having been some time since you last checked on the trio you met there, you head on into the lockerroom. You're quite happy to see that all three of them are in the room, the mall-rat clearly having got out of lock up. The three seem to be having a meal, as all of them have a taco in hand. You hear the rat speak up in a joking tone as you approach. 'Hey Tomas, you must love tacos right?' he asks, snickering. Spike groans at the bad joke and the cat just rolls his eyes in exasperation. 'Jeremy, just because I'm Mexican doesn't mean I love tacos, even if these are good,' he says, muttering the last part. Soon enough, Spike notices you and gives you a smile. 'Hey if it isn't the newbie!' he says cheerfully. Tomas turns and sees you and smiles as well, patting the free spot by the three of them. You take a seat and take a real good look at the mall-rat and see that he has bright green hair and brown fur overall. 'Who's this?' the guy asks his friends. It's Spike who explains that you and them met when he got caught.";
		say "     That brings you to asking how they managed to get him out. That appears to cause an argument as the wolf and feline glare at the mall-rat who shrinks in on himself. 'The idiot is fucking lucky that Spike here has been best friends with Jenna since childhood,' Tomas says. Before the rat can bite out an acerbic response, you ask who's Jenna. 'Oh, Jen? As Tomas said, she's a childhood friend of mine. Nowadays she's the Head of Wolverine Security,' Spike says. That statement shocks you, as you hadn't expected the wolf to be friends with someone who leads a rather... rough bunch of people, you say as much to him. It makes the bluish-gray feline burst into laughter. 'Jenna's rather unique for a Wolverine, that's true. But all her fellow employees respect her, well except for [italic type]that[roman type] guy,' Tomas says, wrinkling his nose when he says the last part. However, before you can ask who he's talking about, Spike speaks up.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'You know, the only way I was able to get Jen to even agree to let you go was by saying you'd work at the store you stole from,' he says. The mall-rat doesn't stay cowed for long and puffs himself up in anger. 'You didn't have to help me! I could have dealt with it myself!' he yells. Spike raises his brows, disbelief in his eyes. 'Really? It didn't look like that when you were being man-handled by the guard,' Spike snarks to his friend. That comment ends up making Jeremy look down in embarrassment. Shortly after that Tomas seems to sigh and take pity on the guy. 'Look Jeremy, you know we love you right? It would hurt us to see you in harm's way,' the feline says softly, giving him a kiss on the cheek.";
		say "     Tomas['] gesture appears to relax the mall-rat, his posture slouchy. He turns to Spike and sees the wolf nodding with a smile, making him sigh. 'I know you two do, but sometimes I want to show that I can be independent,' he admits out loud. By the looks on the other two's faces you can tell they understand him. 'Look Jerry, if you want to prove to us you can be independent, then show us you'll take the job seriously,' Spike says. The mall-rat gains a determined glint in his eyes before nodding rapidly and then moving to lean on Spike, Tomas following motion. Seeing that the three are having an intimate moment, you get up to leave, heading out of the lockerroom. The last thought in your mind as you do this is a question on whether or not the three are more than just friends. You'll have to find that out later though.";
		now LockerroomTrioRelationship is 3; [met the trio three times]
	else if LockerroomTrioRelationship is 3: [fourth time]
		say "     When you head into the lockerroom you spot Spike and Tomas, instantly heading over, yelling a hello. They turn to you and smile and wave. 'Hey there! It's great to see you again,' the feline says, appearing to be holding a box. When you take a second look, you see that they're moving around various boxes into one of the corners of the lockerroom. You ask them what the boxes are for. 'Oh? These? It's my inventory,' Spike says. Inventory? Tomas nods and expands on what the wolf meant. 'You see, what my friend means, is that he's kind of a merchant.' The cat explains, ignoring the eye roll from the canine. 'I keep telling you I'm nothing that fancy Tomas,' Spike says, pretty adamant about it. This time it is the feline who rolls his eyes. 'Come on, you basically trade your wares to people for other items. That's basically a merchant,' the guy says. But before they can argue even further, someone else comes into the lockerroom. It is a buff female wolverine wearing the 'Wolverine Security' uniform carrying Jeremy by his shirt.";
		say "     Spike groans when he sees her, putting a box down and sighing. 'What did Jeremy do today Jen?' he asks, as if this was a regular occurence. Hearing the name Jen makes you instantly realize this must be Jenna, the leader of the Wolverines. When she speaks she seems to have a rather gruff voice. 'Caught the bastard trying to skip on his parole!' she practically snarled. Tomas facepalms and gives Jeremy a disappointed look which causes the mallrat to flinch away. 'Jeremy, I thought you were going to work today?' the feline asks. The guy doesn't respond which prompts Jenna to glare at him and speak in his stead. 'Go on, tell them. Explain to them that I caught you playing hooky and attempting to steal again. Tell them that I basically had to watch you the entire day to prevent you from leaving your job,' she says, sneering at him. It totally seems that the female wolverine doesn't like Jeremy much, that is until her eyes softens and she sets him down.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Jerry, I can't keep doing this for you. It took all the authority I had to prevent the other wolverines from pouncing on you the last time you stole.' She sighs, giving him a soft look. That response instantly had you take a second look at her, she couldn't possibly be a wolverine. Wolverines didn't take no shit from rule breakers, yet here's a wolverine being nice to one. 'I'm sorry Jen... I just can't help looking at how I don't contribute to our trio. It makes me feel like a burden,' he says, his ears flattening in shame. The looks of disappointment on the other two's faces disappear and concern takes its place. They pulled Jeremy into one big hug and each gave him a soft kiss on his cheeks. 'Jerry, you'll never be a burden to us, you know that right?' Spike asks, nuzzles his face to the mallrat's cheek, said guy leaning into it. While the three are clearly having a moment, Jenna turns, finally noticing you.";
		say "     'Ah, you must be the person that the three were talking about,' she says, an odd glint in her eyes. You nervously hold out your hand to her, jumping a bit when the wolverine actually grabs it and shakes it. 'Nice to meet ya, I'm Jenna, but you can call me Jen,' she says, her words surprisingly cheerful. 'The inseperable trio probably already told ya bout me but if you've forgotten, I'm the head of the Wolverine Security company. Have been ever since its inception,' the wolverine says, the glint still unidentifiable. You tell her that you do remember, but that it is still nice for a reminder. She barks out a laugh, shocking you with how boisterous it is. 'I like ya, I can tell me and you will get along just fine. That is, as long as you abide by the law,' Jenna says, the last bit said in a frightening tone that chills you to the bone. Once again you're surprised when she does a one-eighty after that scary tone, switching back to a sweet one.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Jenna stop scaring our friend,' Tomas says, shaking his head in exasperation. The trio appear to have seperated by now but are now instead holding hands. 'Yeah, he probably already knows not to break laws in front of wolverines,' Jeremy says, having recovered from his bout of self-depreciation. Jen rolls her eyes at the mallrat, as if he says that on a daily basis. 'For all we know he could also be nothing like Jerry here and a saint,' Spike jokes, dodging the mentioned person's half-hearted swat. 'Hey! I don't steal all the time,' he says, giving a fake-hurt look. That statement is met by a burst of laughter from both the cat and the wolf, clearly identifying it as a lie. You wait for the wolverine to snap at the mention of broken laws but she doesn't. Rather she just appears to be exasperated by him instead. You question her as to why that is and instead of Jenna replying, it's Spike. 'She's not ripping apart piece by piece because we make sure he always pays back or makes up for whatever he steals,' the wolf says.";
		say "     The wolverine nods at that, a toothy smile aimed at the mallrat. 'Yeah, in my books as long as what's been taken ends up paid for I don't mind. It's why I'm so adamant about him going to that job,' she says rather cheerfully. Jeremy just appears to mumble and groan about it. Via a clock on the wall nearby you see you've been here quite a while. So, you say your goodbyes and make your way out, Jenna deciding to leave with you. When you exit the room she pulls you aside. 'Can you please help me keep an eye on Jerry? I really want those three to stay together but if this continues...' she trails off. You finally decide to ask if the three are in a relationship and the wolverine nods. 'Yeah, I actually helped them get together,' Jenna says. Hearing that, you tell her that you'll keep an eye on him. She thanks you and leaves to wherever she's needed to be, leaving you by yourself.";

Upon peering around the corner and into the shop you see a familiar female wolverine talking to Nermine. The conversation the two are having is rather heated, at least on Jenna's part. Nermine is rather cool and collected, like the jackaless usually is. 'Nermine, you don't even have permission to set up shop here!' Jenna snarls, clearly on the last bit of her patience. All Nermine does is walk over to her register and open a drawer. Out of it she pulls a piece of paper that for some reason she turns towards your direction first. You can vaguely make out an official seal and formal wording before Nermine turns it to Jenna. 'The graceful constabulary will notice that Nermine does have permission to offer her wares here,' the jackaless says.";
	say "     Jenna takes one look at the paper before raging. 'This paper's over a hundred years old! The mall hasn't even been here that long!' she roars. Nermine however just calmly stands there and waits for Jenna to come down from her anger. When the female wolverine has, the jackaless then speaks up. 'If the wolverine lady would direct her attention to the bottom to the bottom of the humble storekeper's document, she will see that it says Nermine has permission to sell here,' she says simply. The other female takes a look at the paper and apparently sees that it is true as she slumps her shoulders. However, the bout of defeat doesn't stay long on her face as Jenna then stands up tall. 'Fine! I'll just keep an eye on you then, that way you can't do anything suspicious,' she says before storming off, not noticing that you're there. It appears though that Nermine has because the jackaless looks in your direction and smiles. Not wanting to stay any longer, you promptly walk away from the store.";

It looks like the female wolverine has acted upon her statement about guarding the jackaless's shop. When you briefly look into the store you can see Nermine just staring at Jenna with a smile, preparing something at her counter. After about a few minutes, Nermine apparently finishes and then takes it to her store guard. You are quite surprised to see that it appears to be just a cup of hot tea, though the female wolverine is confused at the cup. 'Is this poisoned or something?' she asks, looking at it in confusion. 'No, Nermine would never poison a guest of her store. Not unless that is what the customer wants,' the females jackaless says.";
	say "     Jenna looks at the cup a few more times before shrugging and deciding to take a drink. By the look on her face it appears that the tea is quite good. This is further evidenced by fact that she quickly drinks the entire thing. 'Thanks, I guess,' the female wolverine says. Nermine nods and is about to say something but a male wolverine rushes over to Jenna, panic in his face. 'Captain! There's been an incident in the East Wing! Somebody's been murdered!' he shouts. 'Murdered?! What?!' she says, shock on her face. Quickly after that, the female wolverine follows her subordinate, both of them running. Nermine however turns to you. 'It's always good to befriend the local constabulary, no?' the jackaless says with a smile before heading back into the shop. Befriending the constabulary? Murder? You might want to check that out sometime soon. ";

Covering the entirety of her head is a large metal bucket. From her struggles with it via her hands, you can tell the thing's pretty stuck. You are about to walk over there and offer to help but somebody else seems to move in her direction, an incubus to be specific. He has the succubus hold on to railing that's on the wall as he grabs a hold of the bucket and pulls hard. It takes some force but he manages to dislodge it from her head. Once she's free you can see that it was most likely her horns that got her stuck. Her friend, by the way they seem familiar with each other, asks how she got stuck.

He has a black coat of hair and brown eyes and its those eyes, as well as his hands, that tell you that he seems pretty nervous and worried. They dart from spot to spot while his hands fidget something fierce. Soon enough though, his eyes land on you and he seems to brighten up, as if you arriving is the best thing that could have happened to him. Quickly he rushes up to you, a bright, hopeful smile on his face. 'Ah, uh, c-can you be my friend?' the goat asks timidly. Well... that wasn't something you expected. Usually the people who come up to you want to screw you senseless. And it appears that the goat sees that your confusing and apologizes profusely. 'I'm sorry! It's just that I moved here from overseas like just before... well all this happened. So I don't know anybody here at all,' the goat says, ending his sentence with a sigh.";

You're sure that if you were in his situation that you'd feel the same. However, it does bring up a question, why hasn't he already made friends? You voice this question to him, causing him to look down at the floor. 'I... I was too shy!' he manages to shout out. Oh. But then what made him gain the courage to ask you? 'Well... I told myself I'd ask the next person that walks into the room, and it happened to be you,' he mutters. You shrug your shoulders, deciding to go with it. 'So, what do you say?' he asks, his eyes practically begging you to say. Mulling over it for a while, you figure why not. It's not like gaining a new friend will hurt you.";

The hug's not bad, considering it's rare nowadays that you get hugged simply for agreeing to be someone's friend. Half a minute later, after the young man is done repeating 'thank you' over and over again he moves backwards. 'I... uh figure I should introduce myself, I'm Scotty, nice to meet you friend,' he says, his smile filling you with warmth due to how genuine it is.";

You ask him how he was going to deal with the lack of courage with the interview? 'That? Well... originally I was gonna psyche myself up.

Then suddenly, the wolf breaks the kiss and pushes his stallion lover onto one of the many crates filling large parts of the room.

The wolf goes down on his buddy for a few minutes until the stallion eventually can't contain himself anymore and proceeds to slam his whole shaft down his partner's throat, bucking hard against the other man's muzzle. This interestingly doesn't seem to deter the wolf at all - he manages to deep-throat the large cock for about half a minute before he pushes off, gasping for air.

Then the wolf pulls off of his lover's cock and sets dutifully cleaning the remaining cum off of the stallion's proud manhood. Once the blunt-tipped dickhead is polished and shiny the stallion hops off the crate and pulls his underwear and pants back on. Afterwards, he pulls his still crouching canine friend up to his feet and kisses him again, with the two of them clearly swapping fluids back and forth. Once all the cum is spent between the two, they break the kiss and smile at each other. 'Damn, Cory you taste amazing as always,' the wolf says with a large grin.

The anthropomorphic canine currently has his muzzle to the bronco's balls, lapping at them eagerly. After soaking his boyfriend's balls for a while, Jeff presses his nose up to them and inhales deeply. 'Mmm, Cory you smell fucking amazing,' the wolf says with a toothy grin.

The sudden action forces the black horse to grip the crate, making it creak in protest. He doesn't stay this passive for long however, as Cory can't hold back his urges any longer and moves his hands to grip his boyfriend's white head-fur and slams him down the rest of the way onto his cock. 'Fuuuuuck!' Cory groans out as he starts to rapidly throat-fuck Jeff, the horse's heavy balls slapping against his boyfriend's chin.

However, what is much more interesting than the crates are the people in the room. There are an anthro white wolf and a black stallion-morph, busy grinding up against each other. The albino wolf's groping appears to be rather desperate, causing the horse to chuckle out loud, following up his teasing comment of, 'God Jeff, you're such a cock-hound,' followed by a firm grope of the wolf's ass. Said canine gives a wolfish grin, responding both with words and a firm squeeze of his lover's crotch. 'You know I am Cory,' he says with a chuckle.

The horse then pulls back to the tip, his tongue darting out and swirling around the tip of the cock. Unable to hold it in any longer, Jeff grabs his boyfriend by the ears and yanks his head down to the knot. To your utter surprise, the stallion manages to engulf the knot as well, locking it in his mouth. Having finally locked his knot, the wolf howls in pleasure and Cory's adam's apple bobbing.
