After all, it's where the hub of all activity is, so you may run into something interesting there. Once there you take look around, admiring the architecture of the buildings, musing on whether or not the Greeks got their designs from this city or vice versa. However, before you can contemplate this thought any further, somebody ends up walking right into you, sending you tumbling to the ground. 'Oh! I'm so sorry!' a soft yet gruff voice says as large arms reach down to help you up. Not wanting to really remain on the floor much longer you gladly accept the assistance. The hands belonging to the muscular body pat you down, getting rid of the dust that accumulated from you being on the stone tiles. Curious as to who barreled into you, you look up and inwardly gasp in surprise.";
	say "     Standing in front of you is none other than Kurt, the shark-morph that you've listened to both play and sing for people in the market. In hindsight you should've recognized the voice but to be fair you were rather scatter brained from being knocked to the ground. The male in front of you however doesn't miss a beat as he holds out a hand. 'The name's Kurt. I apologize for running into you. I should've been looking where I was going,' he says, bowing his head sorrowfully. You shake yours at him and tell him that you actually know of him, having listened to him play at the market and that you shouldn't have been distracted. The shark-morph tilts his head at you in a bit of curiosity, though you have no clue as to why but he then suddenly gets a toothy grin on his face.";

	say "     'I know how to make it up to you! How about I take you out to lunch sometime soon?' he asks you, his eyes giving you a look that make you feel like he's challenging you to accept. You muse that it wouldn't necessarily hurt to take Kurt's invitation. For one, it's free food, and it'll also let you get to know the man before you. You smile back at him and nod, agreeing to a... lunch date with the shark-morph. You don't know how it's entirely possible but his grin gets toothier and he pats you heavily on the back. 'Perfect! If you can give me at least six hours I'll be ready. Anytime after that meet me in the market!' he says before heading off towards the residential district where you assume he lives. You on the other hand feel as if you're free to do what you want as you don't really need to prepare.";

It also helps you that the male is very noticeable, at least to you, with his clean-cut, button up shirt and comfy looking pair of jeans. He obviously wanted to be fancy for this occasion, so who are you to deny him. Instead, you wander on over and give him a smile which he matches with a toothy one. 'Hey there, just in time! Thankfully the restaurants are open all day,' he says, before holding out his arm all gentlemanly like for you to hold. Raising a brow but deciding to oblige the guy you accept it, and he begins to lead you on your way.";
	say "     It doesn't take you two long before you reach a rather fancy eatery, and to be honest you're kind of glad it is not a fish place. As that would make you feel partially awkward. Instead it appears to be an expensive bar and grill. Kurt hailed down the person standing at the front of the place, to get you two a booth. The woman appears to notice him, and you swear would have stars in her eyes if it was possible, but the shark-morph just asks for a seat as calmly as possible. She was put out at first but quickly shrugged it off before leading you guys to your area. Upon sitting down the male smiles at you and crosses his arms, staring at you in curiosity, causing you to tilt your head at him.";

You raise your brows at him but decide to answer him honestly, since he appears to be wanting a real answer. So, you tell him that you don't see why you should, since he's just like any other person, even if he does have a nice voice and music-playing skills. By then a waiter comes by to take your orders, to which you quickly give, and when you turn to look at your... lunch partner, he appears very intrigued by you. 'The fact that you think that of me makes you very interesting to me, [']cause it's hard to make friends here when everyone just sees you as a celebrity,' the shark says, a sigh soon escaping his lips afterwards. You nod having a vague understanding of what he means. A few minutes later your food comes by and you dig in, enjoying the taste of Atlantean cuisine.";
	say "     After you finish your food the shark-morph nods to himself as if confirming something. 'You know what, whenever you're free come visit me at my abode. My house is to the east when you enter the residential area,' Kurt says to you, giving you a saucy smile. After saying that he gets up and puts the money on the table for the bill. As he walks away you take a good loo at him, and wonder if you really want to visit him at his home before quickly shrugging your shoulders and deciding that you'll think about it later. You then get up and make your own way out of the restaurant, heading out to do what you wanted to do afterwards.";

Seeing people entering and leaving the entrance is entertaining for a little bit, the people watching and all, but you get bored after a while. It's when you spot Kurt heading that way with his guitar strapped to his back that you perk up. Interested, you make your way towards him, tapping him on the shoulder and causing him to turn when you do so. 'Huh? Oh! Hey there!' He says, looking happy to see you. Chuckling you greet him as well, asking him what he's doing heading out of the city with his instrument.";
	say "     'Oh? This? I have a gig outside the city at some club,' he says, causing you to look surprised. People in town know of Atlantis? You honestly thought it was pretty isolated, only the beach-goers knowing about it. Kurt shakes his head at that before speaking. 'Not exactly, sure most of the people who are aware of the city are the people from the beach, but there [italic type]are[roman type] people in town who know of us by either word of mouth from us or by having lived at the beach, the club has one of those people,' the shark explains. You let out an 'aah' before suddenly Kurt turns to you with an intrigued look. 'Hey! How about you join me for this gig? You could watch me perform!' He says eagerly. You chuckle at his enthusiasm and say you wouldn't mind at all, which gets him to give you a smile.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Kurt wraps an arm around your waist and leads you towards the gate of Atlantis, where he nods to the usual two there, Alana and Triton. The two of you dive out of the open gate to allow yourselves some momentum when you start swimming to the surface. Thankfully it doesn't take long before you guys break water, your heads coming up from below. You guys start making your way to the beach, and when you reach the sandy shores, you finally ask Kurt about where he's taking you. 'Oh, well, a friend of mine is the one who got me the gig and they live at the club, The Palomino,' the shark says.";
	say "     You perk up at hearing the mention of that particular name, saying you've been there before. 'Oh! You have? Then you may know my friend, Brooke. I haven't really been able to visit them much since the nanites hit but they said that the club would be glad to have me.' Kurt said with a grin. You nod at that though you do wonder what he gets out of it. 'Oh, well, I get to spread my music outside of Atlantis!' He says matter-of-factly. Well... you guess that makes sense? To be fair the utopia doesn't hurt for food or water so he doesn't need either of those. So, recognition might be the best for the shark.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     After about half an hour you guys manage to reach your intended destination, The Palomino. It's easy enough to get in, and when you do, your shark friend suddenly has an armful of otter. 'Kurt! It's been forever!' The cream colored male says with a smile. The predator just chuckles and sets the guy down, taking a good look at him. 'Yeah it has, you look great, and a lot more coordinated,' he says, his tone tinged with humor. That just causes Brooke to blush and nod happily before twirling, as if presenting himself to everyone. 'Yeah, it's great!' He says before turning towards you.";
	say "     '[if HP of Brooke is 5]Oh! Hey there, it's nice to see you again[else if HP of Brooke > 1]O-oh, hey there. I didn't expect to see you here with Kurt! Maybe you can have some fun with me later[else if HP of Brooke is 1]Oh! Hey it's you! Didn't know you were friends with Kurt why didn't you tell me[else]Oh! Hey! If you haven't realized by know I'm Brooke, nice to meet you,[end if]!' The otter says this all with a smile. You wave it off saying that you're here with the other male to watch him do his gig. As soon as you mention that, the more petite one perks up and nods eagerly. 'Oh yeah, that! We're all ready for you inside if you want to get started right now and I see you've brought your guitar,' Brooke says, looking over Kurt. 'Yeah, I'm definitely all set!' The shark says with a smirk.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The otter leads you two to the dancefloor where there's a lot of people waiting. From there he takes you up to a stage where there are a few speakers and cords. Kurt walks over to them and hooks them up to his guitar before strumming the strings to test it. Smiling once he sees that everything's all right, he turns to face the crowd. You on the other hand scoot back to the backside of the stage. Your shark friend begins to play a song of his own, his voice drifting out into the crowd. Speaking of them, you can tell they love it as everyone starts dancing. You start moving as well, doing a dance in your spot, enjoying the music.";
	say "     This goes on for about an hour as Kurt goes through quite a few songs, and the length of the show is worth it as he appears to be getting a large amount of fans from it. Though you do have a bit of concern for him and hope they don't go too crazy over him as the shark does deserve a bit of normalcy when it comes to other people in his life. When your friend finishes his last tune, the crowd cheers and whistles, causing him to chuckle and brush the back of his head sheepishly. Deciding that he needs to be saved from his current shyness, you walk up there and shout to everyone, asking them that it was a great show wasn't it? This gets them to yell in agreement, so you turn to Kurt and see him staring at you weirdly for a few seconds.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     All of a sudden though, the shark's lips are on yours and he's kissing you rather heatedly and for what you don't know. But you enjoy the gesture nonetheless, so you return it. This garners you some wolf-whistles from the crowd which you just ignore as you continue to make out with Kurt. Though it doesn't last forever as your friend soon pulls away with a slight smile. 'Ah, I think we should wrap up here, we'll talk about this when we get back to my place.' He says, getting a nod from you in return. So, the shark turns to the crowd and thanks them for coming to the show before promptly bowing to everyone, getting another set of cheers and whistles.";
	say "     After that he leads you down to where Brooke is who is just chuckling at you two. 'That was an interesting end to the show, not that any of us minded it.' He says, causing Kurt to get embarrassed. Though the otter doesn't hold that topic for long before turning to your shark friend. 'That was great! I'm sure everyone would love to have you here again, Harold said he wouldn't mind it either,' he said, gesturing over to the unicorn bartender who lazily waved at them when they looked his way. Your shark friend smiles at this and nods happily. 'I'd love to come back here sometime!' He says, clearly enjoying the idea. 'Great! You know how to contact me, now be safe out there,' Brook says, seeing the two of you guys off.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You guys then leave the Palomino, making your way back to Atlantis. On the way there, Kurt slips his hand into yours, so that the two of you are holding hands. It's a little sweet but enjoyable nonetheless. It also comes in handy when you guys reach the beach and dive into the waters below, as your shark friend is able to pull you along, making the swim to the underwater city much faster than it was upwards. Minutes later, you guys arrive at the gates where the guards let you in and Kurt pulls you aside to a nearby stand. The stand holds towels meant for people to use to dry off if they want to, your shark friend hands you one of them and takes one for himself. You both dry yourselves off and then make your way for his place.";
	say "     When you get there, the both of you sit down. 'So... about the kiss.' The shark says, trailing off. You nod, wondering what it was about, though not entirely minding. 'Well, through the time we've spent together... I've developed feelings for you. I, uh, like you.' Kurt manages to stutter out. You chuckle at his nervousness, as it's kind of adorable and you can tell by it that he's never really asked anyone out, that you say as much. 'Yeah, I've always been the one asked out due to my... popularity. and the relationships never went well,' he says, with a wince. Your face makes the same expression, imagining how it went. 'But... if you do like me then, we can go further than... what we've been doing.' You nod and tell him you'll think about it. He smiles at that before thanking you for joining him on his trip and then seeing you out of his house.";

	say "     Your musician friend stands at a tall six foot four, which you guess makes sense for a shark-morph, though you expected him to be much taller for a great white shark. Beyond his height he has subtle bulging muscles that while they aren't the steroid crazy that you've seen many others out there with, it does say that he could probably do considerable damage to you. Outfit-wise the male is wearing just a simple pair of palm tree swim trunks and a black wife beater rather than anything fancy. Though you do know the reason for this, as you did ask him during your little lunch date earlier, so you draw your eyes upwards and notice Kurt's rather striking green eyes before taking another once-over glance.

'When I finally had it in my hands my parents were kind enough to sign me up for lessons at school and it started going uphill from there,' the male says, his strumming turning into a little bit of song.";
	say "     'Soon enough I got good at it, and then we get to when I came to Atlantis, I was down and wanted a bit of my old life so I played some music as I had my old guitar on me,' Kurt says, the song filling the air.

Sure it's not what I thought what but hey, I get to play my music,' the shark says with a toothy smile.

You respond in kind by raising a hand to his bulge, and when it touches you realize you can feel two hardening lengths. Though to be completely honest you should have expected this, as your friend is a shark, who have two dicks. 'Why don't you take both of them out to have a better look, help you get more interested,' he says, his grin now a smirk as he takes his own hand and moves it to yours to guide them to the button of his pants.";

While to others they might be odd, a few thoughts later make you realize that if he leaves the city often he wouldn't want to constantly have soaking underwear. Ignoring them for now you pull those down as well, letting them pool with the shorts and revealing his two large cocks, which emanate a masculine musk that cause you to let out a soft moan. Once more raising a brow in particular interest, Kurt directs his hands to your head before pulling you close to his dicks, bringing you right to the source of the pheromone-intense smell. Brought into a frenzy, you begin licking at both of his lengths, alternating back and forth in intense desire.";

By now though, you decide to focus on one of his lengths while you masturbate the other with your hands. You move your mouth to the left one and take it into your lips, swirling your tongue around, idle hands moving to the right dick to massage it. The taste of pre blooms into your mouth, making you moan loudly, almost in sync with your shark friend, which spurs you on to take him further into your mouth. This appears to trigger something in Kurt as he grabs a hold of your hair and begins to thrust in and out of your throat, fucking your face as thoroughly as he can.";
	say "     'Mmm, fuck you're great at this, I'm already so close!' He growled, watching intensely as you take one of his cocks like a champ and as the other slides against your cheek. Sure enough you can feel the large dicks tensing as he gets nearer to his orgasm. As a last ditch interest in making him go wild you take a finger and position it at his hole before pushing it in roughly. That appears to set the male off as he lets out a loud roar before you feel hot salty liquid spill onto your tongue and warmth pool and splash against your cheek and head. You gladly slurp down the cum, enjoying the taste of the shark's seed, making sure to collect the amount that coated your outsides into your mouth. Once Kurt's climax tapers off, you pull off and give him a sperm-filled smile that makes him pull you up into a kiss.";

	say "     After finishing the kiss he gives you a toothy grin. 'That was great! Didn't know you were so good at giving head. We may have to do this more often,' Kurt says to you, proceeding to pull up his speedos and shorts. You nod and swallow down the remaining cum you had left, telling him you'd be more than happy to take care of his problem any time. You then get up and dust off your knees before stretching your legs a bit, having gotten a bit sore on the floor. When you look at your friend he's still looking at you with interest but has gone back to his guitar. You may as well go back to what you were doing before though.";
