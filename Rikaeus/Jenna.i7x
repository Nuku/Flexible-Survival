I mean I saw those but how did they help?' Jenna asks. Simple, while originally it'd be rather difficult to tell what the murder weapon is by the cuts alone, you realized something. Upon closer inspection you figured out that the cuts were made by a professional grade knife. This time it's the owner of the restaurant that speaks up. 'Yeah, but a professional grade knife isn't something uncommon to find at my restaurant,' Cane says, a confused look on his face. You shake your head and explain that while that is true, not many of the employees handle those knives. The canine murmurs something about that being true, as the knives can be rather dangerous.

Thankfully though he also shies away from it so you won't have a sneezing canine on your hands. You proceed to tell them that the next piece of evidence was gathered by talking to Cane. 'Wait? Me? What did I do?' he asks, utterly confused. Gesturing to the fur, you ask him who in the room have the piece of evidence that he's oh so allergic to on them? The dog's eyes widen, showing that he realizes exactly what you're going for. 'That'd be... Tawnya, Gordon, and Barry,' the canine says, looking at them in concern. You nod and say that what Cane is talking about, is the cologne or perfume on the piece of fur, to which is something that the dog cannot wear because he is allergic to it. This explanation causes Jenna to narrow her eyes at the three remaining suspects. Once more, you move onward with your case.";

Well, I showed you I have no fur,' she says, possibly overwhelmed by the entire situation. Nodding, you then turn to everyone else. You tell them that the piece of testimony given to you by Tawnya was helpful, believe it or not as it cut down on how many suspects you had. 'What do you mean?' Jenna asks, trying to get more information. Simply put you ask them, if the lizard girl doesn't have fur then what does that mean?

Holding the piece of fur out in the open you proceed to ask Jenna who here has brown fur, that she can see. 'Uh, the bear and the dog,' she says, confused as to where you're going with this. You then tell her to have her subordinates strip the monkey. 'Wha-WHAT?!' Gordon shouts as the female wolverine does just that and he's manhandled by the guards. Once stripped almost everyone not employed by Cane gasps when they see that on the monkey's ass is a patch of brown fur. 'So Gordon actually does have brown fur?!' Jenna shouts. You nod and say that it's pretty damn suspicious to dye your fur from your original color, a color that pertains to a murder suspect. You then move on from that, having explained all you could.";

They used to date,' she says, causing the attention to be immediately drawn to the monkey. [if GordonMotive is 3]'B-but I told you I would've murdered Kevin!' the male shouts. You shake your head, saying that makes less sense because murders are usually committed by people you know, and usually love. As far as you knew, Gordon did not know Kevin. [end if]The monkey appears to panic at the attention being focused on him. You explain firmly that with him being the victim's ex, who in fact dumped him for someone else, he'd have the most motive out of everyone. Jenna turns to the monkey and glares at him, clearing rearing up to attack him.";

You slowly walk up to Gordon, gesturing for Jenna to walk in front of you. Out loud to everyone, you say that the killer of Tyler, is none other than the monkey. Instantly everyone gasps, staring at him in utter shock. Suddenly though he gets desperate and whips out a knife stained with blood, but due to you having Jenna in front of you, the monkey's quickly stopped by being tackled to the floor. However, that's not all that happens, no Gordon starts shouting at everyone. 'Of course I killed him! We had been dating for years and he goes and leaves me! And when I confront Tyler, the guy says he's not really dating Kevin, that the guy's blackmailing him! What a load of crock!' the monkey yells. Quickly though he's handcuffed by Jenna's subordinates before being thrown back into his cell. 'I have just the perfect punishment,' Jenna says, a determined look on her face before she leaves.";
		say "     When Jenna returns, to your utter surprise it's none other than Nermine. The jackaless let her eyes roam over the situation before turning to the female wolverine. 'Nermine would like to know why the gracious constabulary brought Nermine here,' she says, her tone surprisingly nice for someone who was dragged here without being told why. 'Well, I am in need of your services,' Jenna says, her earlier reluctance to deal with the woman gone. Nermine raises a brow at the woman, clearly intrigued. 'Oh? What does the constabulary need from Nermine?' the jackaless asks, curiosity very much present in her tone. The female wolverine directs her companion's attention to the monkey in the cell. 'This little shit murdered someone in the mall, I wanted to let you deal with him,' Jenna says. It appears that the magical shopkeeper doesn't care for killers, as she narrows her eyes at Gordon. 'Nermine would be glad to deal with such a serious offender,' she says, walking up to the cell.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     To nobody's surprise, when Nermine touches the door, it clicks open. She walks in and everyone almost panics when Gordon lunges at her. But the jackaless is unfazed as suddenly the monkey is frozen in place. 'Nermine doesn't think attacking Nermine is a bright idea monkey,' she says before grabbing him by the hand. As the woman is taking him out of lockup and probably to her store, she stops and turns toward you. 'Perhaps you would like to peruse Nermine's wares later. Nermine just might have something for customer,' the jackaless says, casting a brief look at her captive before leaving with Gordon. Once she's gone, Jenna turns to you and smiles. 'Well, you've done it! You've solved the mystery,' she says, congratulating you. The female wolverine then turns to the ex-suspects and tells them that they'll get their stuff back and situated, before leading all of you out of lockup.";

'Please hurry, we need to get this solved before people in the mall start panicking about their safety,' Jenna says. You understand that very well, if it isn't solved, then the mall residents may be concerned that the killer will strike again.

Simple things like helping them carry their laundry, or if they need meals,' she happily says. That's... a lot different than her subordinates. The woman laughs at you and shakes her head fondly. 'I know they're a rough bunch but they mean well.' The wolverine smiles. You nod before taking a step back to end the conversation.";

A very angry female wolverine stands there, hands on her hips as she is yelling at another mustelid like her, this one a somewhat larger and muscular male. He is wearing a similar uniform and is bristling with aggression too, but at the same time seems on the defensive, just taking the verbal abuse. Beyond the woman, a shivering male labrador in ripped clothing is being comforted by a mall rat. 'I have had it up to fucking here with you, you piece of donkey shit,' she roars, a crowd clearly forming around them. The guy snarls at her but doesn't say anything, showing that the female has the power here, interestingly enough. 'Your ass is lucky that we're short-staffed as is or I'd have fired and locked you up,' the female wolverine goes on to say in an angry tone.";

'Boys, this worthless piece of crap is to be relegated to parking lot duty. He can cool his heels with the other rapists roaming the streets,' she orders with a firm look to the mustelids that appear to be her subordinates. The males nod at her and grab the angry offender and drag him out of the mall. The woman turns around and helps the mall rat comfort the near-rape victim and leads him away. This leaves you standing around in the midst of the very mixed crowd of countless different species as it slowly dissolves, and you overhear some murmurs of people to one another.
