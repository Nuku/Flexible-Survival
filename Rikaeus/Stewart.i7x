Suddenly though a gryphon approaches you with a smile. 'Hey there, you look confused,' he says in a joyful tone. You give an assent to that statement and ask how to get up there. 'Well, you could just grow wings or perhaps you could find someone with them that could take you up there. I can't cause I'm in a hurry,' he says, apologizing before leaving.

With a shrug of your shoulders you decide to oblige them. Taking a couple steps back you start off into a run before launching yourself off the edge. Once airborne you are spinning in the air, wondering why the fuck you jumped off a cluster of clouds hundreds of feet in the air. Thankfully you do not go splat on the pavement, instead landing in the pool, causing an eruption of water to spray all the students at the pool.

His feathers are of a pure white shade, but the backside of his wings are covered in fur, rather than avian coverings. The fur is of an orange and brown striped pattern that stands out rather boldly. His feet are clawed just like a winged creature's should be. From his backside you can see feathers that spread out into a tail. Clothing-wise he is wearing a white t-shirt with an American flag on it and cargo shorts. The male is currently lounging on the white fluffy clouds, enjoying the sun. When he notices you looking at him Stewart smiles at you and waves his left arm.";

He is gazing over multiple different books of many kinds of subjects and appears to be taking a large swig of coffee from a cup on the table every few minutes. From the muttering under his breath you can tell that he's trying to study. Appearance-wise, the guy's arms are currently in their human form, rather than winged arms he has human ones, that match his olive-skinned tone. He's wearing a button up shirt as well as a pair of dress pants. When he notices you looking at him, he gives you a weary smile and waves.";
	else if Stewart is in Stewart's Room:
		say "The harpy boy is laying spread out on his bed, reading what looks to be fantasy novel. You guess that college students do need breaks from studying sometimes too. His arms aren't transformed, which makes sense as otherwise he'd be unable to hold the book. At the moment he is only wearing a pair of cargo shorts, revealing his human-like chest and his perky nipples. It doesn't take him long to realize you're staring at him, which prompts him to smile at you before returning his attention to his book.";

You look new around here,' the guy says rather cheerfully. You admit that this is your first time actually visiting this place and are rather intrigued as to how everyone is standing on clouds. 'Oh, that. Well from what I know, apparently there's supposed to be a magical place around here that basically solidifies the clouds.' He chuckles. You tilt your head at that answer, not understanding exactly what he means. 'I can sympathize with your confusion, I only know of that information by secondhand. Anyways I'm Stewart, if you ever want to talk with me I'm usually here in the morning but move to the library mid day,' the guy informs you before saying that he hopes to see you again.";

He notices you rather quickly which prompts a question for him. 'Hey, you wouldn't happen to know how to derive a multi-variable function?' he asks rather wearily. Before you can answer, he lets out a sigh followed a verbal apology. 'I'm so sorry, it's just that I have like five different exams coming up within the next week and it's driving me crazy. If you can't tell, I'm currently trying to study for calculus.' The male groans. A thought passes by in your head that perhaps you could help him study to ease the already huge mental burden the guy has.";
		say "     You can tell how stressed he is by two things. One, the bags under his eyes which inform you that he's sleep deprived. Lastly, the five or so coffee cups that have been drained of their caffeine filled contents. 'Anyways, I'm Stewart, a guy harpy if you can't tell by my legs. Before you ask, I can freely transform my arms back and forth,' he explains, showing you by setting down his book before doing so and then changing back.

Vaguely, you understand what he's talking about. If you had paid five thousand dollars out of pocket to get an education then nothing would stop you from getting your money's worth.

Chemistry, Calculus, Anatomy of Animals and Humans, Forensic Science, and oddly enough Italian are the subjects that he is studying.

That prompts a confused look on his face, but he answers nonetheless. 'Uh, well I'm having the most trouble with Calculus. Derivatives just aren't my forte.' He sighs. You nod before writing out a problem for him to do and handing it to him, telling him to solve it. While not really understanding, Stewart still does the problem and hands it to you. Quite quickly you notice his mistakes and point them out before kindly explaining what went wrong. It takes a couple of these problems before he finally gets it. When he does he laughs out loud and hugs you, thanking you greatly.";
				say "     With a smirk you tell him that you aren't done just yet before moving onto the next subject, Chemistry. This entire process continues for each and every subject with you successfully guiding the boy through each of his issues. For Chem it was the atomic numbers, for Forensic Science it turned out to be bullet wounds, and for Italian it was conjugation. However, upon reaching anatomy it became heated. While describing the different looks and anatomy of various infection's dicks you notice that Stewart is slowly forming a bulge in his pants, clearly becoming horny from the descriptions of cocks. With a huge smirk on your face, you climb under the table, very thankful that it is up against the wall.";

				say "     'W-what are you doing?' he stutters out. You quickly hush him and unbutton his dress pants. To your shock, he appears to go commando as you are quickly hit in the face with his above average dick, which leaves a trail of precum on your cheek. When you look up you see that Stewart is trying to not moan just from the cool air hitting his cock. You decide to give the harpy boy a hand, or in this case a mouth, as you swallow the tip of his manhood. This forces him to let out a strangled moan, which thankfully for him isn't too loud. Swirling your tongue around the head of his dick you moan as well, savoring the taste of your study partner's fluids. Briefly you pull off and lick a trail from his heavy balls to the tip before taking his prick back into your mouth.";
				say "     This time around you decide to deepthroat his manhood, taking him all the way to the root. You hear Steward moan, but it sounds to be muffled. Looking up with his schlong still in your throat, you realize why. The harpy boy has currently stuffed his mouth with his fist and is biting down on it. Shortly after you look at him though, his breath hitches, possibly from seeing you stare at him while he's balls deep in your gullet. You try to convey your wishes for him to fuck your face. It takes a while but you manage to belay your desires to him as he gains a blissful look and removes his fist from his mouth before taking both of his hands and placing them on your head.";

When the sounds of balls slapping against your chin and a dick going in and out of your mouth fill the room you wonder why nobody has noticed you two. But you quickly realize that they probably have but just don't care. So, instead you relish the feeling of the delicious cock entering and leaving your gullet rapidly, moaning whenever you taste his precum. [if Player is not neuter]You begin to masturbate yourself rather determinedly, trying to reach your own orgasm, the gesture making you start to pant as well.

However, he has just enough cognitive functions to pull back and let the cum pool in your mouth.

[end if]While the two of you would probably love to enjoy your post-coital bliss, you are in a public place so you promptly clean up and slide back into the chair next to him. 'Ah-uh that was nice....' he trails off, blushing rather hard. 'Um, if you want to help me later or something, you can see me in my room, I'm only there late at night though,' Stewart says.

You do this for each and every subject, though it does get a little hilarious when you reach the anatomy book which seems to be updated with penises from different infections and you notice the cum stains.

Quite quickly you move the kiss from being chaste to rough, pushing your mouth harshly against the harpy boy's. By now you can feel Stewart's manhood at full mast, straining in his pants and up against your own tush. To mess with the well endowed male, you grind your ass up against his manhood.

Taking that as proof that he is enjoying this, you continue to toy with his chest, switching it up between pulling and licking. When you've decided that you've done enough, you move down further. The harpy boy lets out a grunt of disappointment when you completely ignore his rock hard dick. Instead you ease his shorts off of him, his cock springing out and standing tall.

However, due to you being face first into his crotch, you can tell when he's getting close. Whenever he does, you stop and let him calm down, as you don't want him to cum just yet, only when your tongue is deep in his hole do you want it to happen. So, instead, Stewart is whining whenever you deny orgasm. Upon a brief look at his face you can see that its flushed red and he's panting heavily.";

Deciding to take it a step forward, you push your tongue into his pucker, piercing it swiftly and making him shout in pleasure. You begin to fuck Stewart's hole on your fleshy organ moving it in and out at a rapid pace. The earlier actions you took during the foreplay appear to have made the harpy boy's orgasm not that hard to reach.";

A few minutes later, Stewart comes to the end of his orgasmic bliss, his body now limp and spread out on his bed. 'God fucking damnit that was fucking amazing,' he swears, panting clear in his tone. You pull your face out of his ass and move up next to him. With a devious smirk you start to feed him his own cum, something that he gladly does.

	say "     Rather than say anything you climb on top of Stewart and position yourself in a 69 position. The male quickly realizes what you want as you begin to suck at the outline of his cock in his shorts. The harpy boy soon copies what you're doing, his mouth now against whatever clothing you're wearing down there. It appears that this is enough to turn on your friend as you are soon mouthing a fully hard clothed erection. However, you don't want him to cum in his trousers, so instead you pull back to unbutton his pants and then yank them off him. They land in a pile at the end of the bed, but your focus is on his cock. Though, you're not so focused that you don't feel Stewart yanking your clothes off.";
	say "     You catch the tip of his dick in your mouth and suck, making two things happen, one, your friend groaning, and two, a spurt of precum pooling in your mouth. You match the harpy boy's sounds when he swallows your prick into his own oral cavity. Once you get over the shivers of pleasure though, you start to slurp at the cock, the two of you happily sucking each other's manhoods. After a bit though you decide to focus your attention on your partner's balls, taking his prick out of your mouth and replacing it with Stewart's virile sack. You swirl your tongue around the orb in your mouth, savoring the sweaty taste that lingers from an obviously long day at college.";

	say "     By this point in time you're humping your dick into Stewart's throat. Surprisingly the harpy boy takes the skull fucking with a fervor, allowing his mouth to be held firmly against your balls. You redirect your attention his own sack, nuzzling it happily, inhaling that musky scent of his. The manly smell makes you moan and groan, grinding your nose into the underside. Sadly though, you have to refocus on the male's cock as you don't want to cum before he does. So, you swallow the manhood whole, your face pressed against the guy's belly. The two of you are lost in bliss, getting closer and closer to each other's peaks. It's not much longer before you reach your orgasm.";
	say "     When you do, you thrust all the way into Stewart's gullet one last time, dumping your cum into his stomach. At the same time bursts of creamy sperm flood your mouth, something that you eagerly drink up, enjoying the delicious taste. After both of you are spent, the harpy boy and you collapse onto the bed, side-by-side. The male repositions himself so he can cuddle up to your chest, inhaling your scent and sighing. The two of you lay like that for thirty minutes before you sit up, deciding you've spent enough time with the male. You thank him for the time, which he waves you off saying you were perfect before he returns his attention to his book.";

	say "     You decide against speaking and instead straddle the harpy boy's lap, grinding your ass against his clothed crotch. 'That sounds like a brilliant idea,' he murmurs, trailing his hands on your body, slowly taking off your clothes. When he manages to get them off, he tosses them in a pile on the floor, leaving your bare ass against his slowly hardening erection that's hidden behind his shorts. Not wanting to get straight to it, Stewart pulls you into a rough kiss, quickly pushing his tongue into your mouth. Both of you groan into the liplock, slowly losing yourselves to it. While this is happening, you are inhaling his musky male scent[if Player is female], something that makes your pussy wet[else if Player is male and Cunt Count of Player < 1], something that makes your dick begin to throb[end if].";
	say "     A couple of minutes into the make-out session you feel the harpy boy begin to ease his own clothing off, quickly tossing his shorts on top of the pile your own clothes are in. Now his hard dick is hotdogging your cheeks, leaking precum onto your backside. Stewart looks you in the eyes before giving you a soft smile. 'Are you ready for this?' he asks you, clearly caring for your well being. With a moan you let out a tone of assent, very eager for your coupling to begin. That response makes the harpy boy's smile widen even further before he kisses you roughly once more. Following that he grabs a hold of your hips and positions your ass so that the tip of his cock is against your pucker.";

	say "     Slowly Stewart inches his cock into your hole, the stretching makes you moan as you are filled with his manhood. It doesn't take long for the harpy boy to bottom out, his balls now resting against your cheeks. Eager to get started, you grind your ass against his crotch, enjoying the sounds of his moans. Having been encouraged, the male begins to thrust in and out of your hole, his balls slapping wetly against your ass. [if Player is male]Thankfully your partner manages to successfully find your sweet spot, making you leak even more precum from your cock. [end if]Both of you go at you rut for a while, both of you slowly edging towards your peaks. As the harpy boy approaches his orgasm his thrusts get wilder and wilder.";
	say "     When Stewart finally reaches it, he slams into you one last time loosing his load into your hole. You moan at the feeling of being filled with his sperm, enjoying it thoroughly. [if Player is female]The sensation sets you off, making you moan loudly in pleasure, causing you to spill your juices from your pussy. [else if Player is male]The sensation sets you off, making you roar in pleasure as you spray your cum all over the two of you. [end if]Both of you let out sighs of joy, slumping onto the bed. The harpy boy cuddles up to you, letting his dick slip out of your ass. The two of you remain like that for an hour or so before you figure you should get going. When you get up, he smiles at you and thanks you for the fun.[mimpregchance]";
