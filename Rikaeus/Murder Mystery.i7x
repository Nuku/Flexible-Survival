Wolverine Guard Station is a room.
Wolverine Guard Station is east of the Mall Foyer.
Description of Wolverine Guard Station is "[WolverineGuardStationDesc]".

to say WolverineGuardStationDesc:
	say "     The guard station is situated within a coffee shop. There are tiny little tables where big wolverines are sat at, working on paperwork their boss more than likely has assigned them. The shop counter has a wolverine sitting there with a lot more work than the others. Although judging by the fact that said male is also the receptionist, he surely must have more patience than the others. All in though, the place seems pretty homey and looks to be where the wolverines have also set up home as you can see a door with a sign that says sleeping quarters.";

Description of Wolverine Lockup is "[WolverineLockupDesc]".

to say WolverineLockupDesc:
	say "     The place where they store their criminals seems to be located within a commandeered bank that they have connected to the station. You can tell this by the fact that on one side of the room is a massive vault door that is wide open, showing various security deposit boxes. However, the vault isn't where the suspects are stored, no, you see that they're held within the old cells that held money and other things in the bank. Overall, you think it's a pretty decent setup, and unlikely to fail unless the wolverines decide to hold someone much stronger than them and the bars.";

In the fountain that many residents of the mall have passed by was blood stained water and a red furred feline-morph. Surrounding the scene are many of the Wolverine Guards with Jenna shouting orders for them to secure the scene. She soon spots you and waves you over, a concerned look on her face. When you make your way there you get a closer look at the feline. The sight nearly makes you retch. There are vicious slashes all over the body that appear to have been made by a really sharp object if the cuts say anything. When you reach Jenna she sighs and turns to you. 'I can't believe this has happened,' the female wolverine says with a frown. You admit to her that you can't believe it either. She utters a sound of frustration before turning to you.";
	say "     'Would... would you help me with this investigation?' Jenna asks you tentatively. That... surprises you, mostly because you didn't expect to be asked to help with a murder case. You say that much to her, which she nods at. 'Yeah, normally before the whole infection shebang I wouldn't have asked. But... my... workers so to say, don't know that much about investigating murder. They'd much rather charge in,' the female wolverine explains. Well, that does make sense but what could you do? 'I don't know, investigate the scene for anything we've overlooked, maybe interrogate the suspects,' Jenna says. Suspects? 'Yeah, we have four suspects. But first I'll let you know about the victim,' the woman says before barking an order to one of her subordinates. He comes running over with a clipboard that he hands to you to look at.";

He's a cat-morph with red fur, as you can see and was currently dating a male jaguar-morph named Kevin Javine,' she says as you look at the picture. So the victim had a boyfriend? Where was he at the time of the murder you wonder at loud. However, it appears that's a no go as Jenna shakes her head at you. 'Kevin's not a suspect, apparently the guy was all the way at the high rise district during the time of the murder,' she says with a sigh. The woman then tells you to flip the page, which you do so. You're met with the sight of a green scaled, female lizard-morph who has dark blue eyes. 'That's Tawnya Lisord, one of our four suspects. She's about twenty-five years old,' the female wolverine explains. You ask her as to how this suspect knew the victim. She gives you a toothy smile, making you feel like you've done something right. 'Good thought there, well you need to know that the four suspects and the victim all worked together under the supervising of the next suspect,' she says.";
	say "     You turn the page to see the next suspect and find your eyes met with a picture of a brown furred wolf-morph. In the picture he's giving a wolfish smile which makes his green eyes stand out. 'This is Cane Ein, he's twenty-three years old and runs the Doggy Bowl restaurant out in the food court,' she explains. You nod once more and turn the page to find yourself face to face with a picture of a smiling male bear-morph with brown eyes. 'This is Barry Baire, twenty-eight years old. He does all the heavy lifting for Cane,' Jenna says before gesturing for you to turn the page. It appears to be the last page as you are met with the photograph of a black-furred monkey-morph with hazel eyes. 'This is Gordon Nanas, he's twenty-six years old and is Cane's head chef,' she says to you. After she finishes she tells you that you'll want to inspect the body.

Jenna says, intrigued. You nod and show her the tuft of fur you found in the victim's hand as well as mention how the cuts appear to have been made with a professional knife. 'Hmm... well in a restaurant you're bound to find those kinds of knives and two of the suspects have brown fur so...' she trails off. You nod and say that you'd like to question the suspects.

The guard looks weirdly at you before shrugging his shoulders and leaving to probably guard the door. Once you guys are alone, the bear starts shedding himself of his clothes, soon completely in the nude. You admire his body, the buff yet chubby looks of Barry, as well as what will be a big cock, if its soft state says anything. 'Hurry up and strip too, I gotta prepare you,' the guy cheerfully asks of you. Prepare? 'Mhm, I only do anal or blowjobs, but I want your ass right now.' The guy rumbles, the sound sending shivers up your spine. You shrug your shoulders and do as he asks, ridding yourself of your vestments and leaving you as naked as the day you were born. The bear then requests that you get up on the table, your ass facing him. Seeing no reason to ignore what he asks, you do so.";

You groan as his tongue, which it must be as you're pretty sure fingers can't bend that way, begins to explore your insides. The sensation continues for a bit, making you moan and wiggle on the table, ass in the bear's face as he rims you. Soon though, he pulls back, making you whine. 'Mmm well aren't you tasty,' Barry says, before placing two fingers at your asshole. He slowly pushes them in and begins to scissor at your entrance, causing you wince. 'Aw, don't be like that my little teddy bear. I have to get you ready.' The big bear rumbles, causing heat to pool in the cheeks on your face. After he stretches you for a while he pulls back his fingers. 'Alright, now come here and sit on my lap,' Barry tells you. You get up and see that he's sitting in his chair, legs wide open and cock slowly hardening.";

The big guy wraps his arms around you and nuzzles your face with his muzzle, littering kisses on you, as he slowly pushes his dick into you. It appears that Barry's preparation did some good as the big prick doesn't cause as much pain as you thought it would. Inch by inch, his manhood buries itself into you. Once he's balls deep into you, he maneuvers your face so that it's facing his, with his muzzle no less, before kissing you softly. When he sees the confusion on your face the guy chuckles at you. 'You're probably wondering why I'm so soft with you, I'm like that with all my lovers. After all, I'm a big teddy bear after all,' he says. Shortly after he finishes speaking he begins to pull out, quickly thrusting back in once only his cockhead is left in.";
			say "     Just as Barry said, the fucking is nice and loving with him kissing you softly, his tongue practically caressing yours the entire time. It's during this intimate time that you get rather familiar with his fur and once more confirm that your evidence couldn't point to him. Where the fur you found was extremely soft, the bear's fur was neither soft nor rough... it was just right. You slowly lose yourself in the love-making, for that was the only thing that the two of you were doing could be. You surrender yourself to the loving kisses, the hugs, and the nuzzles, all of it making you feel happy and peaceful. Sadly though, all things must come to an end and the bear soon climaxes, releasing his load into your ass, the warmth of it filling you up.";

During this time, you wonder if possibly the bear is single before shaking your head, you have a murder you need to solve. Perhaps after the mystery is solved? The two of you then get up and slowly get dressed. Once you two are fully clothed, the bear pulls you into one last kiss before speaking. 'I loved our time together, perhaps you could find me after all this clears up?' he asks you. You tell him with a smile that you'll think about it before asking the guard to come in. The wolverine tells you that it was a good thing you called him when you did, as it was time for the suspects['] lunch.

To be honest you believe that as the bear appears way too amicable to ever despise someone to the degree that murder would need. Although killing someone doesn't exactly require you to hate that person. After all, a person could whack another by accident. 'Though if you ask me, there is a chance that Cane has a motive. But I wouldn't ever want to think anything bad about him,' Barry says. That catches your attention and you question him as to why the dog would have a motive. 'Well... I don't want to say cause he gave me this job when I had none but... him and Tyler were arguing something fierce a few days ago,' he says. You keep that in mind and tell the guard that you're done before the wolverine escorts you two back to the lockup.";

'We... had been dating for two years and I was going to... well, propose to him.' The big guy tells you, fingering something in his pocket. Ouch, that had to hurt and to be completely honest, it does give him a motive... 'But, if I had to kill anyone it would've been Kevin, not Tyler,' Barry says. After he finishes speaking, he asks the wolverine if he could go back to his cell. As the guard takes the two of you back, you feel rather bad about bringing it up.";
