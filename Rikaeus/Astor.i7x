Section 1 - First meeting

after going to Azure Dragon Culinary Tastes while Loyalty of Astor is 0:
	say "     Opening the doors to the restaurant you're met with the most wonderful smells of herbs, spices, and various meats, vegetables, and fruits. All of them mixing together to fill your nose and body with a desire to eat here. Looking around you can see it looks to be modeled after a diner, which is surprisingly modern for the ancient city you're in but you respect it. The walls are litered with different posters of many different chefs from all around the world as well as different awards from many culinary competitions, showing that whoever cooks here is a prized chef. As you walk closer towards the counter where food is being served, you hear a happy cheerful voice speak out to you.";
	say "     'What can I get for you?' The voice says with a happy and prideful tone in it, causing you to look in its direction. Your eyes are met with an azure scaled dragon wearing a chef's apron and a pair of black slacks to go with it. In his hands is a spatula that he seems to hold with a certain finesse that screams professional. You tell him that you wanted to take a look, as it's your first time here, which causes him to smile at you. 'Ah! A brand new customer! Well then, if you want something to eat then take a seat and I'll be happy to serve you up some grub! The name's Astor, a lot of the people here know me as one of the Four Lords.' The dragon says before returning his attention to the grill.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'The food I sell here is pretty special, it'll help keep you strong, though only for a while.' He says, as he flips some burgers before turning his attention to some stirfry on another stove. You ask if there's anything special in it that makes it like that. 'Well, you could say my magic? But honestly, it's just mostly because of how I cook my stuff. It only lasts for a little bit because the body eventually filters the food out.' Astor says with a shrug of his shoulders as he serves the burger he was working on and rings a bell, causing a waitress nearby to grab it and serve it to a customer.";
	say "     You make an aaahing noise and ask him how long the effects last. 'Well, for about a day. As that's how long most food stays in your body anyways. You also can't mix effects of the food, it doesn't quite work like that.' The dragon says, shuffling the stir fry in the pan. You nod and say that you'll definitely have to try some when you can. 'Perfect! I'm always here as I sleep in between moments when there's not many people here. As I don't need much sleep. Also, as currency I accept fish, two of them per meal.' Astor says, serving the food and ringing the bell again, causing another waitress to come and serve it. You nod and thank him for the information before letting him return to work.";
	now Loyalty of Astor is 1;
	now PlayerMet of Astor is true;

to say AstorDesc:
	say "     Taking a look at the cook you see him hard at work cooking up the meals of the various customers of his restaurant. Moving your eyes to glance at his clothes you notice that his apron isn't a plain white one, no it says 'Kiss the Dragon Cook' which makes you chuckle. Besides that he seems to be wearing a regular t-shirt under that as well as a pair of black slacks. Body wise he has two large azue scaled wings that are held close to him, probably so that he doesn't knock anything over when he cooks. He also seems pretty well built under the apron and shirt, which makes you give an appreciative whistle. While you're admiring him Astor seems to notice this and raises a brow at you and chuckles.";

You nod, wanting to get his opinion[if loyalty of Sheng is 5], especially of your Master[end if]. Shrugging his shoulders he works on some of the food orders he has in front of himself before continuing to talk. 'Well, they're not bad people first things first.' He says, stirring a pot of stew to his left. You nod, waiting for him to continue. 'Sheng can be a bit strict with his personality but he softens up when he gets to know you.' The dragon says with a shrug of his shoulders. [if loyalty of Sheng is 5]You nod eagerly, causing him to glance at you and notice the collar. 'Oh... you must be his pet he's talking about, well, it's nice to meet you. He seems to really care for you.' Astor says with a smile.[end if]";
	say "     'Serafino... he's kinda special, not in a bad way, but I swear he's the reason for most of the nudity and public sex complaints we get from the citizens.' Astor says with a roll of his eyes as he turns to flip a burger. You raise a particularly interested look at that. 'Ah, well... he likes being very public about his relations and let's leave it at that.' He says with a general air of, let's move on. 'Kuo I think is the most calm of all of us, but that's to be expected considering he runs a dojo. But it's also doubly to be expected when it doubles as a place of sex.' Astor says with a drawl as he peters off that statement.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You take a double take as he says that last bit, giving him a blank look. 'Well, if you lose or win you can have sex with the opponent. Of course it's all willing so nobody gets hurt really.' He says. Astor goes to serve the food he's been cooking before humming and thinking outloud. 'Overall I wouldn't give them up for anything. Cause they're my friends and have been for a really long time.' He says with a smile. You smile back at that statement, glad that the dragon has such good friends. Seeing that you've reached the end of the topic you let him focus back on his work.";

Thankfully the dragon serves it right in front of you soon after and tells you to dig in to which you eagerly do. The burger is nice and juicy, filling your mouth with a rich taste. The condiments and toppings compliment with a nice perfection that makes you moan in delight. If you were to look at Astor you would see him smirking. It's no surprise that about a minute later the burger is gone and your plate is empty, leaving you rather sad. The dragon grabs your plate and puts it in the sink and thanks you for your patronage.";
