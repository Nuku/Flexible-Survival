What really hits you is the fact that the city appears to be so peaceful in such a hectic world, as if the apocalypse changed nothing for them. It really lives up to the legends of being a utopia. Looking around you notice to your north is the Royal Palace of the city, with stairs leading right up to it. To the south is the residential area of Atlantis, where the various citizens live.

Though to be completely fair what else would there be in such a place. You guess it's just rather surreal to see it in its current location of all things. Nevertheless, the public garden is rather gorgeous in comparison to the water just sitting within the edges of your vision. There's diverse swathes of flowers and trees as well as large open patches of grass for people to probably lay and possibly have picnics. However, noticeably a big portion of the flowers in the back appear to be the same kind, a bunch of purple pom-pom flowers with snaking leaves. They all surround a statue of a beautiful woman wearing what looks to be priestess robes. Beyond all that, it appears to be a pretty average looking park complete with the arch to your east that leads back into the residential areas.";

You see hundreds of what look to be mermaids and mermen swimming around outside the bubble, having fun and playing around. Out of the corner of the eye you see some of them dive towards what looks to be an enormous golden gate. The gate opens up when they reach it and to your utter surprise, the mermen and mermaids['] tails vanish and are replaced with legs. Upon closer examination you also notice they don't stay naked for long, putting on clothing that is handed to them by the guards. Intrigued by the whole thing, as you swore you saw that merman head in this direction, you swim down towards the gates.";

You direct your attention to where the sound came from and are shocked to find a familiar looking face staring at you. It's the merman you saw staring at you when you got the trident! 'Yes King Poseidon!' 'Yes Father!' the mermaid and merman say respectively, causing you to raise a brow at the male. Poseidon nods and heads off, not before throwing you an interested look.

You look around in awe before redirecting your attention to the man in front of you. You are able to take a closer look at him and see that he has long bright orange hair that goes down to just below his shoulder blades. You're also able to see that his weapon is not a spear but a trident, one that looks oddly familiar to you. The female on the other hand has vibrant red hair and dark brown eyes that look a bit serious to you. Her weapon however is still a spear. 'I'm not exactly sure why father has an interest in you but I do hope you enjoy your stay,' he says to you. You blurt out that you had been following him ever since you had acquired a trident from fighting feral sea dragons.";

You swear that you hear Alana chuckling behind you as the prince blushes. You ask him why but it appears that what you said has temporarily put him out of commission. Instead it is the mermaid that answers your question. 'It's... probably better if you go see King Poseidon himself. Easier for him to explain,' she says, sighing. By the time the woman finishes, Triton has recovered and manages to say one last thing before you're on your way.

You tilt your head curiously at them wondering what they're talking about. However, before you can voice your questions, the two step apart and gesture for you to continue on in. Shrugging your shoulders, you continue on into the palace. You soon come to a gorgeous throne room with a sapphire throne whose design could simply pass as a dining chair if the back and armrests weren't so high.

'Well, simply put, it's because you passed my test,' he says, shrugging his shoulders as if it explained everything. You don't recall taking any kind of exam so you vocally request for him to explain. 'The fake trident, getting it was a trial to see if someone was eligible to be my spouse,' he tells you, making your mouth fall open in shock.

If it turns out well, then perhaps marriage,' the buff male tells you. Well... you guess that was kind of obvious, causing you to wonder out loud when the first date will be. 'Oh, that, don't worry.

Out of curiosity, you inch nearer to them and listen in on the conversation that the three of them are having. 'Jasmine, Tyra, do you think that little Jerry could play with Jemma and Zach?' the mermaid asks the other two.

'This isn't so much an event, as something that's always on. It's a way to give back to the community and feed those who can't eat due to responsibilities they have or because of... well you know.

Apparently they were having a day of long training, so they needed all the food they could get,' is her response, something that makes you simply nod at the answer.

The buff male hums before speaking up, answering your question. 'Well, those legends were true to a degree. Atlantis was a utopian city and still is, but it did not sink. No, rather my father decided to move the city after the Greek Era ended, as he was sure that the many kingdoms would want to attack, despite his strength,' Triton tells you, leaning against the wall by the gate. You nod once more, understanding what he's talking about. Seeing this, the man continues. 'Every century or so he relocated the city to prevent humans from finding us as they were a rather persistent species,' the prince adds on. That confuses you a bit, so you mention the current times, where there are people who used to be human visiting.";
	say "     'Ah, that. Well, my father figured that with the human world going down whirlpool, so to speak, that it'd be best to open Atlantis again for an... asylum,' he says. You nod, though you wonder out loud as to why he would care about the mortals. 'Well... he's always had a soft spot for you guys,' is his response to you. Shrugging, you figure that it's best for you to end the conversation, as you don't have anything else to talk about. You turn away from him as the male goes back to guarding the gates to the city.";

to say TritonTalk2:
	say "     'Ohohoh, you want to know more about the amazing race of mermaids and mermen?' he asks, flexing his muscles. To the right of him you can hear his female guard partner groaning. 'You do that every time someone asks Triton!' she complains, the sound of her voice making you think she's rolling her eyes. The merman prince ignores her and continues to speak to you. 'Well, simply put, you could say the mermaids and mermen are a creation of my father, if you consider him trying to fix a curse of one of his many siblings. Although, I'm a creation of my father and my mother, may she rest in peace,' he tells you, though the last bit is probably just to let you know his mother has passed.";
	say "     'Nevertheless, we're both aquatic and land based as a species, mostly for the sake of convenience since my father doesn't like to look like a merman twenty-four seven,' he says, shrugging his shoulders. You nod at that, as if you could change between certain forms you would rather not have a tail instead of legs all day everyday. He then follows up by explaining that because they change on the spot that they have to have a change of clothes so they're not running around nude. 'Despite how cool that'd be, it's frowned upon in public,' he says with a sigh. Suddenly a hand comes and hits him on the head. 'You're such a pervert Triton,' Alana says, rolling her eyes. That just causes the male to wiggle his brows at her. 'You know you like it,' he says suggestively. Once again the mermaid hits him. 'Ow! Abuse! I call abuse!' he shouts loudly at her. Seeing that this won't go away anytime soon, you head on your way.";

Her dark red hair falls down to the small of her back, something that you'd suggest to her would be detrimental to fighting if you weren't sure it'd get you a punch in the face. Of course, she doesn't look to be a violent person to begin with, but it'd be best not to say to a warrior that their hair is a problem.

I mean he does his work but he is a pervert,' Alana says, muttering the last part. Upon looking over to the prince you assume that this is a regular argument as he's just sticking his tongue out childishly at her, something that she doesn't respond to. 'Although I guess I wouldn't say he's truly spoiled. King Poseidon did make him work for everything,' she says. Once again you direct your attention to the buff male and see him nodding along. 'Yeah the old man had me prove myself to him that I wouldn't rely on his power or wealth. Was a pain in the ass to do,' he says, agreeing with her. From that you feel like that's all that is going to be told to you for now, so you leave her to her work.";

to say AlanaTalk2:
	say "     You ask the mermaid what her job at the gate consists of, something that she offers no resistance against on answering. 'Me and the brat over there guard the only entrance to Atlantis, which is this magical gate that King Poseidon made thousands of years ago,' she says, gesturing to the golden thing behind her. You ask her what's so special about it something that she replies to rather quickly. 'It's what generates the bubble you're in right now. Without it certain species or beings wouldn't be able to be in the city,' Alana says. You mention that to get down here requires to be able to breathe underwater in the first place. That prompts a surprising chuckle from her as she answers you. 'Only recently did it. After all, Atlantis wasn't here for that long. It was in other places before. Places that didn't require gills or something else to get to,' is her response to her. You nod, figuring that you understand it.";
	say "     You then ask her what would happen if the gate was destroyed. She raises a brow as if sizing you up on whether or not you'd do such a thing before shrugging. 'If that did happen then water would come rushing in. The buildings wouldn't be destroyed as they're reinforced but people would be hurt,' Alana says to you. That actually makes sense, since the water wouldn't be displaced anymore. However before you can head off on your own, Triton makes a side comment. 'Even so, it's very unlikely for that to happen as the gate is extremely strong,' he says, swinging his trident at it for emphasis as it doesn't leave a mark. After he does so you decide to let them return to work as you've gotten all the information you could get.";
