to say StudyingDormStudents:
	say "     Wandering the halls you come upon the dorm's common area where you find a group of five students all studying. From the sounds of it, they appear to be studying for math. One of them, a leopard-morph speaks up. 'Hey do any of you recall the rules for derivatives?' he asks, scanning his textbook. Another one, a twink-like bear-morph chimed in with his response. 'Nope, I think I'll just wing it for the upcoming exam,' he says, leaning back in the chair. The third one of their group, a female wolf scoffs and rolls her eyes. 'Just because you're sleeping with the professor doesn't mean that he's going to give you a passing grade. That gets a snort from the bear. 'Methinks it does,' he says, waggling his eyebrows. This just causes the last of them, a female horse to slap him on the back of his head.";
	say "     'We all know the Professor definitely won't give you a passing grade just because you're fucking him. If anything he's going to expect you get a high grade,' she says, giving him a stern look. This causes the male to sigh and get back to work, proving to you that her statement is probably correct. 'Ugh, I know, the Professor will probably say that he wants the best for me,' he groans, cementing your thoughts in place. With all of them now eagerly studying and talking about topics that you're unsure about, you continue onto what you were doing previously, looking around the dorms. ";
to say PublicDormFucking:
	say "     On your way through the dorms you can hear the sounds of moans and groans. Out of curiosity you edge closer towards where they're coming from but as you reach the source of everything you realize two things. One, the voices are male, and two the door is wide open. So, you ask yourself a question.";
	say "     [bold type]Do you peep on in the obvious public sex?[roman type][line break]";
	say "     [line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - You're really curious, so of course.";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - No, you'd rather not at the moment.";
	if player consents:
		say "     Your interest getting the better of you, you edge close and peer on into the room. When you can see what's in there you can see a naked male wolf-morph and an equally naked, to your surprise human who is spread out on his stomach on the bed. The wolf on the other hand is stroking is hard-on with one hand while fingering the male's hole with the other. 'Mmm fuck, you're still tight as ever babe,' the wolf mutters, adding another finger to his partner's ass. 'I bet you can't wait till you take my knot,' the canine teases his boyfriend. 'Of course I can't... it'll feel so fucking good.' The human moans this out loud, pushing back against the digits.";
		say "     Appearing to be unable to wait any longer, the wolf-morph sits up on his knees and positions his hard cock at the hole of his partner before pushing in. This causes the human to gasp out in both pain and pleasure as the tip of his lover's dick pops into his ass. From your spot you can clearly see the canine's shaft slowing going in, inch by inch, spreading his boyfriend wide who appears to be enjoying it thoroughly by fact that his tongue is lolled out and he's moaning loudly. Once the wolf is fully sheathed, he leans over the back of his partner and pulls him into a kiss, the two practically trading spit.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     After a minute of kissing, the wolf begins to pump his hips back and forth, fucking his lover as rough as he could while trying to maintain the kiss. That ends up resulting in the sound of his furry balls slapping against the human's cheeks. With a free hand he grabs ahold of his partner's own cock, beginning to jerk it, something that raises your approval of the male as it appears he cares about his boyfriend's desires. The two go at it like that for quite some time, amazing you with how much stamina they have, but you can tell that the wolf is fast approaching his climax as his knot was starting to form.";
		say "     Sure enough a minute later the human lets out a yelp as his boyfriend manages to lock his knot into him, shooting his seed deep into his ass, claiming him as his bitch. 'Fuck, take my cum babe, take it all,' the wolf mutters, speeding up his masturbation of his lover's own cock. The entire sensation is too much for the male and he groans before he cums as well, spraying his load all over the bed sheets. Rope after rope of jizz stains the cloth but it soon peters off, unlike his partner who you can tell is still going due to the white liquid leaking out of his hole. The one tied turns so that he's facing his lover and begins to cuddle with him. This sight makes you decide to head off, not wanting to watch in on a much more intimate scene than you already have. So, instead you head off on your own, making sure to quietly shut the door behind you.";
	else:
		say "     You shake your head and turn around, moving onward with what you were doing, not entirely interested in looking in on something intimate for two people. Even if those two people are doing it with the door wide open it's not your business.";

to say CoupleDormFight:
	say "     'Why were you out with him late at night!?' You hear a male voice shout as you walk past an open door. Sneaking so that you aren't seen you peer on in and see two male dogs arguing with each other. 'I was just going out for drinks with him, you don't need to be so jealous,' the other says, looking somewhat betrayed. 'Then why did you return so late?' his boyfriend asks, suspicion lining his tone. 'Because, the frat boys ended up wrecking the on campus bar,' is the reply that came back. However, it is soon after met with a rough kiss as the two shove each other against a wall and begin making out. From how everyone walking by is ignoring this, you feel like you can safely believe that this is a common occurrence, so you shrug your shoulders and continue on with your journey.";

to say MaleDormSlut1:
	say "     When you walk through the dorm building you swear you notice sexual sounds and all male by the tone of it. However, you're unsure if you want to continue going forward, so you ask you a question.";
	say "     [bold type]Do you go forward despite the sounds you hear?[roman type][line break]";
	say "     [line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - You're really curious, so of course.";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - No, you'd rather not at the moment.";
	if player consents:
		say "     'Mmm, fuck the dorm slut is tight as always,' a voice moans to your back right. Turning around you spot a group of three males: a lizard, a wolf, and a jock bunny, surrounding a twink-ish male fox. Out of the four of them, only the vulpine is as naked as can be, the others are currently still wearing their clothing. Though, you can tell that the voice you heard from earlier was the bunny, as he was currently balls deep into the bare-bodied guy below him. At the other end of him was the lizard who was happily fucking the fox's mouth, balls slapping against his chin. It didn't take long for the lapine to release his load, and instead of in his hole the male ends up spraying it all over the vulpine's back.";
		say "     Taking the bunny's place is the wolf, while the lizard is still content to take purchase in the fox's mouth. 'Now remember, don't knot with him. We don't want to be stuck here for an hour or two,' the one at the front says. The canine rolled his eyes before slamming into the vulpine rather roughly. 'I know I know. This isn't my first rodeo with the slut.' You turn your attention to the guy getting fucked and notice he's pretty into it, moaning and groaning loudly as they all fuck him, minus the lapine who is simply sitting on a chair, watching it all. You realize that the fox notices you out of the corner of his eyes but doesn't say anything.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Not long after that, the lizard pulls out and lets out a gasp of pleasure before shooting his cum all over the male's face, the fox happily licking it up and cleaning the guy's cock off. Following that, the wolf let out a howl and backed out, spilling his seed and adding it to the bunny's earlier mix. Once he's done, the three get up and get cleaned up before heading off, leaving the vulpine to clean himself up. Before you can leave however, he wanders over to right where you are and gives you a smile. 'Hey there, I saw you watching, did you enjoy the show?' he asks you, a wide smile aimed in your direction. You raise a brow at him which just causes him to chuckle. 'Well, my name is Justin, and as you heard earlier, I'm the dorm slut[if cocks of player > 0]. Perhaps we can have fun sometime?'[else].'[end if] the newly named cock-hound offers, winking in your direction. He then sighs and heads off, telling you that he's going to his room. Shrugging your shoulders, you get back to what you were doing.";
		now JustinRelationship is 1;
	else:
		say "     You shake your head and continue onward as you aren't interested in what's happening at the moment.";

to say MaleDormSlut2:
	say "     When you walk through the dorm building you swear you notice sexual sounds and all male by the tone of it. However, you're unsure if you want to continue going forward, so you ask you a question.";

	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - No, you'd rather not at the moment.";
	if player consents:
		say "     You come upon a familiar sight. It is Justin, the dorm slut being fucked by the trio from before. Just like last he is currently being fucked by the bunny who is clearly enjoying it just like the other time. At the other end of him was the lizard who was happily fucking the cock hound's mouth, balls slapping against his chin. By now though, your... new friend appears to have noticed you but doesn't say anything again, content to deepthroat the cock in his mouth. It didn't take long for the lapine to release his load, and instead of in his hole the male ends up spraying it all over the vulpine's back.";
		say "     Taking the bunny's place is the wolf, while the lizard is still content to take purchase in the Justin's mouth. 'Now remember, don't knot with him. I really don't want to be here forever,' the one at the front says. The canine rolls his eyes before slamming into the vulpine rather roughly. 'You don't need to mention that every time, it was one time!' You turn your attention to the guy getting fucked and notice he's pretty into it, moaning and groaning loudly as they all fuck him, minus the lapine who is simply sitting on a chair, watching it all just like before.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Not long after that, the lizard pulls out and lets out a gasp of pleasure before shooting his cum all over the male's face, Justin happily licking it up and cleaning the guy's cock off. Following that, the wolf let out a howl and backed out, spilling his seed and adding it to the bunny's earlier mix. Once he's done, the three get up and get cleaned up before heading off, leaving the vulpine to clean himself up. Before you can leave however, he wanders over to right where you are and gives you a smile. 'Hey there, I saw you watching again! Did you enjoy the show again?' the fox asks you, a sultry look on his face. Justin then looks at his state of attire and smiles at you before heading off to his room again.";
	else:
		say "     You shake your head and go on your merry way, not interested in what you may be hearing.";

to say FratPartyShameWalk:
	say "     On your way into the male dorms you hear what you equate to the groans of the damned. Quickly turning around you see countless males shambling on in, mumbling about the bright lights of the entrance hallway. Judging by their state of attire and the fact that all of them are wearing the same shirt you assume that they're all college frat members returning from a party. 'I really shouldn't have drank that much,' one of them groans, running a hand down their face. 'Shut up, we all shouldn't have drank that much,' another says, sniping back at his friend. They manage to slowly make their way to their rooms, despite the pain they're in.";
	if SatyrFratRichardRelationship is 4:
		say "     As they head into their room you hear chuckling behind you. You turn and see Richard, who's smirking at all of the wasted frat boys. 'They're all lightweights compared to us satyrs, don'tchya think?' he asks, leaning against a wall. You laugh and nod your head, remembering the amount that the goat-men drank at the satyr party. When you manage to get your giggles under lock and key you ask him if this is a common sight. 'Mhm, because of the nanites managing to protect people from alcohol poisoning they drink themselves silly but, they still suffer the consequences. I used to be like that but thanks to the change in species... I'm more or less immune,' Richard tells you. He then looks at a nearby clock before telling you he should head off to study. You wave him goodbye.";
	say "     Noticing that everyone has left you make your way back to what you were doing, exploring the dorms.";

Male Dorm Events ends here.
