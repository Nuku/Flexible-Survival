A low-toned voice emanates from them. When you finally see them, you're intrigued, at the very least because of his appearance and the worry on his face. What's before you is obviously a college student that has to be in art classes with the 'Art is Life' shirt and the paint splatters all over his clothes. Beyond that he appears to be a male panda, [if scalevalue of Player < 4]and bigger than you in just about everything. [else if scalevalue of Player is 4]and the same size as you interestingly enough.

'Could you possibly help me with something?' he asks, a slight bit of desperation to his tone. You wonder as to what he possibly needs from you that could be so urgent, after all he just met you. Saying as much, you're sure that if the panda could blush, he would. 'Ah, well I have an assignment due real soon and you're the perfect help for it...' the male says, trailing off. You raise a brow at him causing him to look even more embarrassed. 'Oh I'm so sorry! I'm asking this question without introducing myself! The name's Jake!' he says with a smile, holding out his hand.";

	say "     Taking a look at the panda's paw before mentally shrugging and accepting it, you shake his hand. His smile widens a bit before he rubs the back of his head with his free hand. Suddenly though he looks as if he's had an idea. 'Hey! Before I ask you to help, how about I show you what I do?' Jake asks you. Now that's an interesting proposition, asking him what he means. 'Well, I want to show you my gallery, it'll help you understand what I do,' the panda says. You nod, what he's asking makes sense, him basically giving you an idea of what you're getting yourself into is a fair offer. So with a shrug you nod your head. He smiles at you and bounces lightly on the pads of his feet.";
	say "     'That's great! The campus lets me display my works in the hall on Creative Street so if you could meet me on the street itself that'd be great.' Jake nods as he says this. 'It's in the northwestern part of the campus if you don't know where it is. Also, I may be a while so if I'm not there when you show up don't worry.' He continues, giving you instructions on how to get there. You give your thanks to the panda for the information and he smiles at you widely. 'No, thank you! If you agree I can finally finish my assignment!' he says cheerfully. You two say your goodbyes before he departs, probably to finish what he was doing here.";

'That's great, I can show you to the art gallery. It's not far from here,' he tells you, leading the way. As you walk through the art covered street he points out different pieces of art on the buildings, who painted them, and the inspiration behind them. The entire exchange is rather nice so it's rather surprising when you quickly arrive at the hall that Jake was talking about.";
	say "     'Here it is, the Tenvale Art Gallery. Now, my art isn't the only one that's usually on show here, as they rotate who gets the hall based on whose assignment is due next,' he says, pulling out a set of keys and putting one of them in the door. Once it's unlocked he heads on in, holding the way open for you. You nod your head in thanks and head on in. 'If you can, flick the light switch to your left,' he requests from behind you. Looking for what he mentioned you spot it in the darkened room and flip it, bringing light to the gallery. When you turn towards the center of the room you spot the panda in a showman-esque pose with his arms spread wide practically presenting the place to you. 'So, what do you think?' he asks, looking rather hopeful.";

	say "     What you see is rather magnificent to say the least. It appears that Jake is diversified in what he does for art as you let your eyes roam the gallery hall. You see many paintings adorning the walls but not only that you see sculptures, pottery, and he even seems to have dabbled in photography, though not as much as the others. Wandering from painting to portrait you can sense a bit of emotion in each one, a little bit of what the panda must have been feeling when he was making them. While you can't say you completely understand every bit of meaning behind them you do at least enjoy them.";
	say "     You say as much to the panda who lets out a big smile and you're sure that if he could he'd be blushing. 'Thanks! I worked really hard on all of them, some of them I put all nighters into them to get some progress done,' he says with a sheepish chuckle. You raise a brow at him, not really having realized how dedicated he was to his art before. Nevertheless you ask him about the request he had for you. He looks shocked, as if he forgot about it then nods excitedly. 'Yes! That, let me go to my temporary workspace here. So I can get my assignment papers,' Jake says, rushing off. You wait there for a bit, before that time becomes a couple of minutes.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Soon after that the panda comes back with an exasperated, almost angry look. When he approaches, you ask him what's wrong, prompting the guy to sigh. 'One of those stupid anime girls stole my art supplies again,' Jake grumbles, causing you to ask if this is a common occurrence. He rolls his eyes and then nods. 'Yeah, every once and a while a specific one of them wants to try her hand at drawing [']kawaii['] art.' His eyes seem to twitch at this as he says it. 'Like, why does she have to steal my stuff, the college has free art supplies. I worked hard for mine.' He groans before turning to you.";
	say "     'Hey, could you possibly go retrieve my stuff from them? Usually when they take it they hang out around Lecture Street, something about how it's nice and quiet for drawing or something,' he asks kindly, even bowing a little bit. You mull it over a bit before shrugging, as it's not like you won't happen upon them while exploring the campus. 'Thanks! Now I need to head back to my workspace so I can clean up after their mess. When you have my stuff, return to the street this place is on when you can,' Jake says before heading off, assumingly to where he was before. You shrug and head back out of the building and out onto the street.";

However, you do think for a minute on the problem before coming up with a possible solution that would save both you your modesty, if you even had it in this era, and Jake his dignity. So, walking up to the panda you pat him on the shoulder and speak up suggesting that you offer to at a later date guide him outside the campus to find a candidate for his painting.

You chuckle and pat his back, happy to at least make someone's day bright. Though you do ask him how you'll get ahold of him. The panda pulls back and nods. 'Oh yeah, you can come to my room. I'm there most of the time. It's on the second floor of the dorms on the east side,' Jake explains, smiling wide. You nod and say you should probably let him return to work as the people at the gallery might be wondering what he's doing.

Because of how old my father was, he ended up dying due to them so I lost him and I was alone and all I had was my studies and my art,' Jake says with a sigh before his expression changes into a smile. 'A day later the new Dean approached me. He talked with me about my situation and asked if wallowing in despair is how my parents would want me to act,' your friend says, chuckling at the last bit. The male glances towards his art workspace and he gains a blissful look on his face. 'He then told me if I wanted to remember my family then perhaps a change in career was in mind for me, especially since the nanites took care of most if not all diseases,' Jake explains.";

'I immediately was thankful for the suggestion because I thoroughly enjoyed my art classes,' Jake says before getting up. The panda's situation sure was rough but it looks like he's in a good place now though, at least according to what you know. 'So, that's the story as to why I'm so into art hopefully I didn't bring your spirits down too much,' the male says with a chuckle.

You raise a brow and bring about a question, saying don't they usually have models for that? The panda instantly looks at the ground and mumbles something, causing you to ask him to speak louder. 'I said, they wanted us to draw someone from outside the class and I thought you fit the profile,' your friend says. You 'ah' and nod your head, understanding his original reaction to you. Patting him on the shoulder you smile at him before saying that you'll definitely help him find someone worthy of a painting. He returns the facial expression and gives his gratitude.
