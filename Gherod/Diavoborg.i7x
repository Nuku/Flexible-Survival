Your advantage is that you can see anyone coming from miles away, but that is simultaneously your problem, as they can also see you from a considerable distance. While there's plenty of tall grass, it isn't by far an ideal way of concealing yourself from possible dangers, so you're left pretty much out in the open. Nonetheless, this fact actually somewhat helps you in the upcoming event. Far, very far in the distance, you see a monstrous shape, looking small to your eyes now, but seemingly huge when you come closer.";
		say "     Whatever you are looking at, from this far, you can't quite make any distinguishments regarding its shape or nature, but it seems to be some sort of beast, and a [italic type]very[roman type] big one. You should know by now what very big beasts can do to puny little preys if they ever get their strong, gigantic clawed paws on them, so you should make a decision based on that, and possibly in how much courage and bravery you've got... and even how kinky you are. Would you like to [bold type]investigate? There are enough conditions to do it safely[roman type]. Or you can always just [bold type]leave and note this area out of your future wandering[roman type], if you prefer.";

			Linebreak;
			say "     Your decision is to investigate, and for that, you should get ready for some stealthy crouching using the grass as your only cover while you direct your efforts towards approaching the beast. As you are practically squatting through the entire way, your thighs soon get sore after such a workout, only to minimize the chances of you being detected. Though you can't help but have second thoughts as you realize how actually enormous the creature is. Its color could have fooled you, but everything else points at the fact that this magnificent, grand beast is... a Behemoth. There is no need to panic, however, as it seems very peaceful for now... Just keep a safe distance as you observe the plains dweller.";
			say "     It is incredible, a red furred counterpart of the horned four-legged beasts often avoided around these parts even by the most experienced survivalists, for they are massive, mighty and powerful, nearly unbeatable in an unfortunate encounter with one of its kind. You really don't want to end up being its food - or something worse... right? - and if you want to get even closer, you'll have to crawl now, as the grass barely hides you with your current method of travel. With that said, you lie your body on the ground and proceed to push it forward using both your arms and legs, just to cut a little bit more of distance between you and it...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You're not quite sure of what it is doing, but right now, it seems entertained with something near the tree in your sight, sniffing around and pushing it with its paw. It's actually menacing seeing those sharp claws that could probably severe you in one blow if they had the chance to hit, and something tells you this behemoth is not like the others, and the first reason being the shape of its tail. The spikes around it and at the tip remind you of a scorpion tail, instead of the scattered ones usually seen in these beasts. And the obvious visual characteristic, its red fur, is also a blatant sign that there are plenty of differences to take into account regarding this creature that you don't know of, yet.";
			say "     Suddenly, you have to stop, as it makes a move that, yet again, is quite unusual. The red behemoth effortlessly gets up, standing on its back legs and leaning against the trunk of the tree, leaning its enormous head over the foliage, and with another paw, it reaches for one of the fruits that would otherwise be too high for it to reach (it is a very tall tree, and you see very few of these). Then, it takes the fruit out and sits down, grabbing it through the stalk and biting it whole, gulping it down within seconds. And while all this happened, you could confirm that at least some of it is male, as its enormous dong dangled before your eyes, bouncing around while it was standing up.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The beast does this a few more times, and you keep seeing its gigantic junk hanging beneath that monstrous frame, with its sack that is more comparable to a couple of basketballs accompanying its movements. Now that is a hole destroyer, and that's without mentioning how incredibly muscular these creatures are and how hard they fuck. Sadly, you don't have enough information to conclude if this is an average size for someone of their kind, as this is the first red-colored behemoth you see since ever, and it's possible that you won't be seeing any other... for a long time, at least. Either way, the four-legged gigantic beast ceases to give you a show once the tree runs out of fruits. Did it really just eat [italic type]all[roman type] of them in a span of what, a couple of minutes?!";
			say "     Now it seems to be walking away, to wander off to some other place within the plains. It's probably best to let it go for now, and perhaps in the future you will be able to learn something more about it.";

Speaking of which, you happen to stumble across that same tree where you last saw the peculiar behemoth beast, a four-legged beast of magnificent proportions, with slight differences compared to the usual forest green behemoth that often roams the farthest region of the plains. It was interesting to see how resourceful it was - and how well-endowed - when it was reaching for all the fruits in this tree. You can't help but wonder if you'll ever see it again, and discover the reason behind this odd mutation[if intelligence of Player > 16]... Well, [italic type]certainly it must have had something to do with the nanites and the way they reacted in this specific beast, or a mutation set that is not entirely originary from the behemoth strain[roman type]... almost surely[end if].";
		say "     Although, while spending some time thinking to yourself and glancing around the area, you notice some marks on the ground that you could almost for sure never fail to notice. It's footprints, and very large ones, which can only mean a monstrous creature was here just recently. Following the tracks could, perhaps, lead you to it... But it may also lead you to a normal behemoth, and that might be problematic. This particular area of the plains isn't covered by a lot of grass, so you will be left visible, denying you any chance of preemptively retreating. This means that if you decide to [bold type]follow the tracks[roman type], you will have to commit to this action until the very end and deal with any consequences of this decision, but it may be worth your time, as there is a chance that these footprints belong to the red behemoth.";

Fortunately, it seems distracted enough to not notice your presence, but what is it doing, exactly? Your curiosity gets the best of you immediately, though this area where the beast led you actually has a little more to take cover from view than the one behind, which means you're in luck. Same strategy as before, you seek a hiding place that provides you with a good view of what is happening, and take it, concealing yourself within the tall grass.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     The first thing you notice is that the beast seems to be... the right word would be grunting a little, not out of annoyance, but something similar to a moan, just way more beastlike and definitely scarier. It is an exciting find, however, but it is even more interesting to see what is the situation causing such a thing. The view widens your eyes, as a fully erect, four and a half foot long of an gigantic dick right beneath the enormous frame of the beast is brightly presented to your gaze for entertainment, and as the creature's back legs are slightly spread, you can also see that the beast shares the hermaphroditism from its cousin species, with a leaking vulva just behind the basketball-sized testicles hanging in there.";
					say "     What's more relevant, however, is that said massive shaft is getting grinded on some other creature underneath the beast, screeching like mad in what seems to be an enduring protest. A closer look reveals that it is one of the bald eagles, a rather large avian man, but tiny in comparison to the towering behemoth that is pinning him down. There's not much he can do against a giant and heavy meatlog almost as big as him, pressing against his body and keeping him on the ground, slowly getting more and more covered in the beast's precum. Looks like the red behemoth is finding himself in need of a satisfying release, and what's better to achieve that than finding another creature, willing or not, to satisfy its primal desires?";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     You observe them for a while, the behemoth just going faster and faster as if it was fucking some hole, in desperate need of pleasure and nearly dragging the bald eagle across the ground with every thrust. Eventually, he begins to cooperate, wrapping his arms and legs slightly around the girthy beasthood, a gesture that the monstrous creature greatly appreciates, with its grunting intensifying as the enormous balls bounce back and forth, hitting the eagle's legs, smashing the ground, and making a dusty mess all over the area that makes it hard for you to see. Although the prolonged grunt that follows in the next moments is quite suggestive of what's happening.";
					say "     With the beast raising its head, its huge cock hardens and throbs to its maximum, only to deliver a massive load of cum right on top of the poor bald eagle, who is helpless to the whole situation, forced to accept a bath of behemoth cum right off the tap. It keeps going for quite a while until it starts to subside, and once the dust settles down, you see a huge pool of jizz around the creature, still pinned down under the monster's dick. You can even smell the musk from here, a very enticing one that nearly makes you think it would be a good idea to get closer, except that wouldn't be safe for you, at all. However, the beast ends up getting drowsy and falling asleep shortly after... With the avian man still underneath.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Looks like someone is going to have a heavy naptime, both for different reasons, but that also means there is nothing left for you to see. It might be a good idea, however, to take note of this area the next time you want to look for the exquisite behemoth, so you can avoid unnecessary risks.";

It also ends up being quite fun to watch it in action, so you can't really complain. Given the opportunity, there is now a chance to head over the area where you last saw it, in hopes of finding another trail, or even the beast itself. Although you should keep in your mind that it's always somewhat risky to do this, so you should [bold type]keep your guard up[roman type] and give a good thinking about proceeding with this quest.";

It is still a creature with needs, and that shows with a certain type of behavior such as this. Nevertheless, observing the beast still proves to be quite an entertaining task if your intention is to know more about it, as long as you keep out of its way and don't look like an easy prey. Achieving that should be possible if you keep low and use any spots to conceal yourself in case of any event.";

All you've go to do now is to pay attention, keep your senses to their maximum performance, raise your guard and glance around carefully as you slowly make your way through the tall grass. There should be some tracks on the ground eventually, if the beast has been here recently... Though it takes you a significant amount of time to find tracks, and once you do, they don't seem to make sense. The footprints seem to intertwine and are spread around in circles, leading nowhere in specific, at least on the first impression.";

However, as you were so busy directing all your attention towards trying to solve this [']puzzling['] trail, you only notice the earth shaking beneath your feet a while after, with an overtaking shadow following up...

Instead of resolving That Red Cave:
	say "     After having encountered that one peculiar behemoth person who could actually talk and act with the intelligence of a normal person (which is, by the way, an extremely odd situation, given the fact most behemoths are not talkative at all, grunting and fucking everything that moves... or worse, given their size) and experienced a few events together, he (yes, [']he['], as it was established already that he is an actual person, or something like that) has let you know that he lives in a cave close to the mountains, accessible through the Dry Plains... of all places. Traveling through such a vast area only to arrive at the only visible rocky region from here is, indeed, a chore, but you have gone through worse. In fact, things look particularly calm, you haven't been ambushed by any sex-crazed creature so far.";
	say "     Just how, exactly, would it happen? A sentient behemoth with a scorpion tail and a spicy fur color, with a personality as big as him, and so almighty and powerful as he is? Would he be the only one who happened to have this condition? Or is there something he is not telling you? Many questions could surge in your mind if you thought well about them, as they easily drift around when walking through a long, long area full of uninteresting things to see, mainly grass and ground. There is also the possibility that he lied to you and there is actually no cave, which would be immensely frustrating and disappointing, but one should not be judged so lightly. After all, you barely know this... beast.";

Your feet actually hurt... but you have to ignore the pain, or most of it, if you want to make it until the end.";

Now that you think of it, he never mentioned how his cave looked, or the appearance of the entrance, or even its remote location. You are simply looking for it because he said it existed! No details whatsoever were given on where to head to when looking for this specific place. And why would you spend your time doing this? Perhaps you are thinking it would be worth gaining the friendship of a large, powerful and very unique beast? Well, maybe it is, but that remains to be seen.

Then suddenly, an enormous creature jumps out of nowhere towards you, pinning you down under its heavy, clawed paw, and proceeds to give you a very, very large and wet lick on the face. It is the red behemoth. 'Look who's here! I thought you'd have been eaten by now! Glad to see my tasty snack found its way to my trap!' Your eyes widen in realization, then revolt takes over as you discover that you have been tri-... He speaks again before you can finish that thought. 'I'm just kidding. It would have been a genious move on my part... which also surprises me that it would have worked, somehow... But that wasn't my intention. I just wanted to say hi.' he says, giving you another lick as you attempt to process what is happening. 'You look tired. Wanna head inside?' he asks with a wide smile, open enough so you can see his gaping throat from where you are, and you blink for a moment... 'Not inside ME, you dork. I mean my lair. Home. Whatever you want to call it. I'm not going to eat you!'";
	say "     Since he is making the invitation, perhaps you should take it. You did not come all the way here to leave with no results, after all your effort. You nod at the big beast, and so he helps you up and pushes you gently to walk in front of him. 'It's not too far. Just keep going forward, then turn around that corner over there, and we'll be close.' he tells you, as you both make your way towards your next destination.";

The only exception is his tail, which while retaining the usual nine foot long size, its spikes are longer and stretch forward, the ones towards the center arching downwards, resembling scythes, and are venomous.

	say "     'For sure! I was needing one badly, in fact...' he says, giving you enough room to make an approach close enough to his sizable parts. The animalistic scent intensifies the closer you get, and it is truly amazing to see how big and heavy they look from this angle. He is currently standing on all fours, as per normal, and in order to provide you a good reach, he stretches his back legs and brings the rest of his body forward, in this way lowering his balls to ground level and allowing you to effectively touch them. 'Hope you can get all angles like that.' he says, and indeed, you are able to move around his marvelous gonads without getting squashed. After letting him know that everything's good, you get to work by putting your hands on his furred balls, surprised by the soft feeling of all teh fur once your palms lay on their surface.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     He lets out a soft huff, caused by the first impact of your initial rubbing, running your hands all over the roundness of his balls, which bounce around heavily, as full as they seem. On the other side, you see your beastly friend growing a boner, and a very large one by the looks of it. It starts thickening at first, then as the veins pop out, it begins to raise tentatively, expanding with each throb as it continues to grow, further encouraged by your so much appreciated massage. What is impressive is that, even for something that big, he is still a grower. You observe his huge cock increasing in size as it hardens, leaving its former size to shame as it hits a whole four and half feet long, primed to its fullest.";
	say "     It is not only his masculine equipment that seems to like the attention you are giving his balls. Behind the sack, right above you, his engorged labia and a constant stream of watery secretion are proof of his general appreciation, although you end up catching a few drops from his inevitable arousal. 'You are really good at this...!' he compliments your efforts, as you apply pressure on all the right spots, not too roughly, but not that softly either. He seems to like a good firm rub all across his gonads, one that actually manages to reach every bit and corner of his sack, a task that would be difficult for someone with large paws such as his 'It's so difficult for me to reach over there...' - he comments, as you make a move towards the meaty back of his sack, usually stretched due to his low hangers and right above them - 'Y-yeah, right there...!' You suppose you should just comply, since he is loving it so much.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     But your persistent movements leave the red behemoth very, very horny. So much in fact, that he begins to ever so slightly hump the ground, his vast cock grinding against the smooth rocky surface where he's leaning against, and you feel all the momentum concentrated in his big testes. Heavy bouncing from back and forth ends up taking your hands along, forcing you to adopt a more solid position in order to keep the rubbing going. 'Fuck... yes...' he grunts in a beast-like manner, letting his primal needs take priority over anything else. You don't think he really is paying attention to your efforts anymore, as his movements get more wild and intense, at some point becoming so fast and rough that it seemed as if he was pounding a tight hole.";
	say "     From this point forward, everything that comes out of him is moans and grunts, no words or anything that would suggest his human background, only pure lust in the air. As he continues to do this, you are more trying to hold yourself onto his balls rather than actually rubbing them, but you keep trying to do your best. This lasts until you feel those enormous balls raising, and one final prolonged grunt as Diavoborg hits the point of no return. You definitely feel everything in his sack shaking and trembling as his cum starts getting pumped out, one glance over his cock showing you the deluge he's causing in that area. A whole lot of spunk delivered upon the surface in its thickest form, white and creamy simply forming a puddle that soon reaches you, as he continues to shoot like the huge creature that he is.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     His orgasm seems to last for a while, until it subsides. Eventually, he comes to the realization of what happened, then lets out a chuckle. 'Fuck, you're really good at that. I guess I got a bit carried away...' he says, looking a bit embarassed at the enormous mess he has made. 'Well, I guess I have to clean this... Uh... Thanks! This was amazing...!'";
	say "     It seems like he really enjoyed the attention you gave him, although he can't help but feel a little shy. Perhaps that's just his personality.";
