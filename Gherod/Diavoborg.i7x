Clearly, he is not the first thing you see, which means that this beast person is very cautious. Once you find yourself within his proximity, you will most likely be noticed and engaged upon immediately. If you want to [bold type]know more about him and follow him about more discreetly[roman type], you might want to continue seeking him under a [bold type]smaller frame[roman type]...

Perhaps it caught something (or someone), as you see their focus is turned towards the floor, and it will not pay attention to you unless you get too close, an action that is ill-advised unless you want to send trouble your way. There is more to explore that does not necessarily require you to pass through this creature, as the plains are wide enough for many of you, giant-sized people and mutated beasts, to co-exist.";

Then, one moves forward, and the other flinches for brief moments, but allows it. They smell each other like dogs taking others['] scents, and you would think this is all just to perform greetings... until one of them positions behind the other and begins to mount them.

Their grunts are very audible as the top behemoth continues to thrust, pulling out and pushing in a steady sequence, only picking up the pace as time goes by. What was before a slow initiation turns into a rough session of hard fucking, their pounding making the ground around them shake.";

The grunt diminishes quickly, and becomes something more prolonged and low, associated with a brief dizziness. Then, it's only moans, as the beast collapses.

The spikes around it and at the tip remind you of a scorpion tail, instead of the scattered ones usually seen in these beasts.

Then, it takes the fruit out and sits down, grabbing it through the stalk and biting it whole, gulping it down within seconds.

Sadly, you don't have enough information to conclude if this is an average size for someone of their kind, as this is the first red-colored behemoth you see since ever, and it's possible that you won't be seeing any other... for a long time, at least.

A closer look reveals that it is one of the bald eagles, a rather large avian man, but tiny in comparison to the towering behemoth that is pinning him down. There's not much he can do against a giant and heavy meatlog almost as big as him, pressing against his body and keeping him on the ground, slowly getting more and more covered in the beast's precum.

Although the prolonged grunt that follows in the next moments is quite suggestive of what's happening.";

It keeps going for quite a while until it starts to subside, and once the dust settles down, you see a huge pool of jizz around the creature, still pinned down under the monster's dick. You can even smell the musk from here, a very enticing one that nearly makes you think it would be a good idea to get closer, except that wouldn't be safe for you, at all. However, the beast ends up getting drowsy and falling asleep shortly after... With the avian man still underneath.";

Traveling through such a vast area only to arrive at the only visible rocky region from here is, indeed, a chore, but you have gone through worse. In fact, things look particularly calm, you haven't been ambushed by any sex-crazed creature so far.";

Many questions could surge in your mind if you thought well about them, as they easily drift around when walking through a long, long area full of uninteresting things to see, mainly grass and ground.

How did you find your way here?!' he asks, loudly, gnarling at you with his sharp teeth quite visible only to intimidate you. 'You'd better explain yourself now...' - the red behemoth makes a threat, as his huge wet tongue slips on top of you, not just licking you all over in one go, but actually coming back to get an even deeper feeling about you, as if... he is [bold type]tasting[roman type] you! - '...

You shouldn't have ventured here.' he says, and gives you another very wet lick across your entire body.

I know who you are! Damn, I almost ate you!' The behemoth lets out a laughter as he finds the fact that he mistook you with a tiny and edible prey is very amusing. Not only that, you also hear his stomach growling. 'Well I probably should have eaten you up, to be honest! Because with that tiny size of yours, I don't think we can do half the things we would be able to if you were big like me! What happened to you?!'";

Well, I guess I can still eat you, then.' - he says, but immediately follows up with something else - 'Hah! Just kidding! I'm not going to do that unless... You ask me to. But anyway... Wanna head inside? You'll surely be safer in my cave than out here, all puny and vulnerable. You're still cute, though... Which doesn't really help you, either.' Since he is making the invitation, perhaps you should take it. You did not come all the way here to leave with no results, after all your effort.

The only exception is his tail, which while retaining the usual nine foot long size, its spikes are longer and stretch forward, the ones towards the center arching downwards, resembling scythes, and are venomous.

He is currently standing on all fours, as per normal, and in order to provide you a good reach, he stretches his back legs and brings the rest of his body forward, in this way lowering his balls to ground level and allowing you to effectively touch them. 'Hope you can get all angles like that.' he says, and indeed, you are able to move around his marvelous gonads without getting squashed.
