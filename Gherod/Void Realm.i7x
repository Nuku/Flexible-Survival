Version 3 of Void Realm by Gherod begins here.

"Adds the Void Realm to the game."

[Version 1 - Adds the Void Realm virtual hunting ground with 3 encounters (Void Serpent, Dark Tyrant, Peculiar Summoner)]
[Version 2 - Added the Tentacle Abomination encounter]
[Version 3 - Extended Void Fireflies event. Added Odd Treasure and Mirrors event. Peculiar Summoner now drops a drink ingredient on defeat.]

[  ENCOUNTERS  ]
[Note: All losses with encounters in the Void must be bad ends (including fleeing), unless they're part of a quest or any specific context where losing and surviving has a justified reason. They must all be integrated within the Void Realm navigation system using trackers and in conformity with the other encounters, or event-based through the "Go Beyond the Veil" navigation option.]
[Currently, all 3 encounters can be found while navigating through the Core Line, with the Dark Tyrant being activated through a special event.]

[Void Serpent - A non-unique encounter. Significant threat, weakened by Abyssal Edge, scared away by sharp black tusk]
[Dark Tyrant - A special encounter. Almost impossible to beat, unless weakened by Abyssal Edge, can become ally (TBA), can be defeated permanently]
[Peculiar Summoner - an unique encounter. Not the biggest threat, cannot be weakened, easy to avoid and checks are fixed]
[Tentacle Abomination - a non-unique encounter. Mild threat, weakened by Ancient Tome, easy to avoid]
[   Tracker for this one goes up to 4 due to the order its tracker is handled through the moves]

[  COMPANIONS  ]
[Note: All text change provided by the existence of a companion must be in ITALIC, so the player can more easily see what changes. This only applies to singular paragraphs or short sections, and following long scenes (such as Xaedihr's sex scene in Tendril Plants) may be written in ROMAN as per normal.]
[Currently, 1 companion provides special scenes while in the Void.]

[Xaedihr - Provides very useful help in surviving through the Void, softening some penalties and sometimes is able to save the player's life. Has special scenes. Can learn Invoke Dream spells to allow the player to experience bad ending scenes within the safety of a harmless dream]

[  NPCs  ]
[Note: Some NPCs outside of the Void are, in some way, related to this Realm, or provide some service related to this content.]
[Currently there are 2 NPCs with implemented interactions.]

[Xaedihr - Can enchant Abyssal Edge's Weapon Damage with Null Essence. Can enchant his own Weapon Damage with Null Essence.]
[Toron - Can restore Abyssal Remnant to Abyssal Edge with Null Essence.]
[      - Can create drinks with the following items:]
[        . Null Essence;                            ]
[        . sharp black tusk;                        ]
[        . loose tentacle;                          ]

It is another ransacked shop with nothing left, only broken glass scattered around the windows and a complete absence of sound, which worsens the more you proceed forward. There is nothing else around but destruction and abandonment, consequences brought by the apocalypse, but besides this, something seems to be really disturbing you, and you find yourself helplessly unable to explain what it is, exactly. It's just something you feel... A shiver, sudden loss of thoughts, an instant discomfort rapidly growing inside as if a nightmare was chasing after you. The sense of danger, maybe there is a creature approaching...?! Though there is nothing. Paranoia slowly begins to take over your mind, and a cold drop of sweat follows after.";
		say "     Reality seems pointless, the air around you is heavy, your body refuses to move, and then you can't breathe. But at the same time, there you are, alive, your heart beating, your senses in overdrive, but your brain seems incapable of understanding its surroundings. There is a hiss echoing through, and that is when you see a gigantic scaly body of a snake, passing right by you and through the buildings like a slowly moving train, seemingly endless. Your heart stops at that moment, facing the imminent danger, and it is a feeling you cannot control. You feel powerless, disarmed and tiny, as the serpent makes its way unhindered by any obstacles that prove to be nothing for its titanic dimensions.";

A very black sort of shiny rock, it seems, though it seems to slightly change its color when you touch it. Possibly a chemical reaction to your skin or from the pressure when you hold it in your hands, however that only makes this object more mysterious.";

It will consume your mind the more time you spend in there. This was just a glimpse of what it can do... Even experienced sorcerers choose to stay away.' He explains, walking to your side in the process. 'But if you must, then I recommend that you take me with you. This [italic type]Null Essence[roman type] that you've got has tremendously useful properties, and I find myself helplessly drawn to it.'

Inside, it is pitch black, but there is an ominous sound coming out of it, like a low frequency rum that makes your insides reverberate. It's almost as if it was breaking your perception of reality right at where you stand. There is no mistaking it, this is the place you were seeking.";

Only go in if you know what you are doing.";
		say "     Having a [bold type]strong psyche[roman type] may be advantageous, but if the contrary is true and you possess a [bold type]weak psyche[roman type] instead, you're most certainly doomed, as you will lose your mind to the void at an alarming rate. Additionally, if you are a particularly [bold type]kinky[roman type] individual, the Void Realm may provide you with a [italic type]vastly different[roman type] experience, but nonetheless, this place will use that against you in the most effective ways.";

Thought to be a [']he['] due to its enormous male appendage, the gigantic body of pitch black goo gives you a [']toothy smile['], with an arrangement of razor sharp teeth that reminds you of a shark's maw. As a long reaching tongue comes out, there is a constant stream of gooey drool being a clear suggestion of how much this monster hungers. He assumes the shape of a freaky shredded humanoid monster with its dark slimey form, enough to overpower anything and anyone in his path.

Hunger is evident in the way these monsters trick and feed on their prey, and it clearly intends on taking you, too.

With his long tongue wrapped around you, he hides his teeth back in the goo and pulls to towards what would be his lips, enveloping you in the black goo as his tongue keeps working all over you.

It is as if the Dark Tyrant felt some sort of affection for you, so much that he wants to make you feel good before he takes you inside him.

The Tyrant's dick is bigger than you, thicker than you, and very, very solid, despite it still being made of goo. He puts you underneath it, pressing your body against the underline of his shaft, bringing you down and up through it as his massive erection rubs across you entirely, only to make you feel his entire appendage throbbing on top of you.

Although what happens next is much, much worse, as you find yourself sinking in that stuff when he pushes your head past the slit.

With a finger, he presses against your soles, and completely shoves you inside his rod, having achieved so much hardness that you thought it would be impossible to reach for something made of slime as he is. Inside, however, it feels like wobbly flesh, constricting and pulsing all around you like a living heartbeat, warm goo throbbing all over your body as you keep sinking, deeper and deeper, until you are finally dropped in what seems to be his balls, or rather, a huge sack of more goo.";

You feel the Tyrant caress his sack with you inside, everything rumbling and bouncing around you as you are kept sealed tightly inside his nuts.

CreateNullEssences is an action applying to nothing.
Understand "GetNE" as CreateNullEssences.

Carry out CreateNullEssences:
	ItemGain null essence by 100 silently;
	ItemGain sharp black tusk by 1 silently;
	say "     100 null essences added to your inventory.";
	say "     Have a tusk, too.";
