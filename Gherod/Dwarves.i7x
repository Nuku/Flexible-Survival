A little further ahead, there is - or was - what seems to be an entrance to a tunnel right through the rocky walls. It has collapsed, though you hear a lot of agitation coming from there, namely a short burly man shouting and hitting on the debris with his stone hammer. You can't quite understand what he's saying from here, you're standing too far to be able to hear him decently, but whatever it is, it looks like the man is having an argument with the rubble, or maybe someone is on the other side?

His voice is deep and mature, one that you'd expect from a middle aged man. 'Come on! We're the same, here! Why would you keep me away?!' You hear nothing in response, only the impact force of his hammer hitting the rocks, but it doesn't seem to help him open any entrance. 'We could have lots of fun fucking each other all day, it's no fair to keep all the fun for yourselves!' The man seems to slow down the hitting and the shouting, seemingly giving up on trying to get across the collapsed tunnel. He might not be the only dwarf around here, judging by his words.";

'Hah... you know what, I don't need you dorks! I've found myself someone to fuck out here!' he says, readjusting his leather belt and throwing his hammer over his shoulder in a display of strength, supporting the weight with his body as he walks towards you.

You suppose this is the work of the dwarf, who was finally able to remove the obstacles in order to make it to the other side. There's a chance that you might find something interesting if you decide to investigate, but beware that you're very likely to be trespassing dwarven territory.

You proceed with caution, paying attention to any strange sound that might be heard at this point, as you carefully step through the rubble and move what's still blocking you with your hands. There's all kinds of stuff used to block the entrance, from metal scraps to wooden broken crates, and you have to watch out not to get injured by any of the rusty blades menacingly pointed at you.

Several more steps and you start seeing light in what seems to be a larger room, one enough for you to actually stand up straight and freely explore. It's actually a relief once your feet land on solid floor, some kind of stone mosaic covering the area. It seems to be some kind of basement, with walls made of stone and only a few torches scattered around the walls. There are a few ornaments on the floor near them, so dusty that you can't actually see their natural colors, and boxes with all sorts of trinkets and other things, suggesting that this might serve as some sort of antique storage.

It gives you the feeling of some kind of old ruins, excavated and built in a large scale, even more so for dwarves. There are some large doors along the massive corridor, but none of them are open and you don't think there's any way to force them. You've got no choice but to walk forward and hope to find something worth coming here.";

Seems like you just stepped into an armory, or at least some place where the dwarves store their old equipment. Any of this would be too heavy or bothersome for you to take, and the armor is not even usable... You figure it should be better to investigate this room a little more, having a look at every bit and corner, and you do manage to find an adjacent chamber with something covered with a large blanket.

What are you doing here?' asks the roaming dwarf you've encountered before in a sarcastic tone, as if mocking your demise.

'I could use a release, actually... And seeing you here so helpless can't be by chance, right? How about I make use of your holes in exchange for your freedom, eh? Sounds like a good deal to you? It does to me.'

Giving your best to satisfy the horny dwarf, you open your mouth and kiss the length of his manhood as he slides it back to meet your lips with his glistening tip, the sweet surface caressing your taste buds as your tongue wraps around the glans. The dwarf lets out a pleasure grunt as he feels you working his cock, pushing it into your mouth as he takes hold of your head. He's actually gentle about it at first, but he makes you deepthroat his dick to the very last inch. 'That's it... That's a good [boygirl]. Like sucking this cock, don't you? Bet you longed for it...'";

The dwarf spreads your legs so he can get between them, [if player is not naked]and you feel him taking off your lower gear to expose your ass[else]and you feel him giving the back of your bare thighs a nice squeeze[end if] before spreading your cheeks and sliding a finger above your pucker.

Your hole stretches around his tongue, which is going deep and back out repeatedly, giving you blissful sensations as he truly puts an effort into eating your ass out. With a hasty retreat, he pulls his tongue out and kisses your pucker goodbye, standing up with his cock in hand. 'Alright, that's enough for you. Better put that tasty ass to use elsewhere now, yeah?' he says as you're already feeling the warm tip of his prick kissing your anus, and it's not long until he starts pushing.";

There's almost no pain on your side, and eventually it all starts feeling too good.

Still underground, but it's very wide and well illuminated, despite that. Their constructions don't spread in width, but more in depth.

This specific edifice has an [']U['] shape, so it is possible that the ceremony is being held in a cloister on the backside of the building. That means you will have to get past the entrance and all the knights keeping guard by the frontside of the place.

Past the way between the tunnel leading back to the surface and the first signs of civilization, you eventually enter the city.

Do they keep their women in the kitchens like the sexist pricks back in our society from some time ago? Or perhaps... Men mine and women cook? I can't say which one I'd prefer.'
