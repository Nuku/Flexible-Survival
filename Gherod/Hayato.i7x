Soot and smoke filled the air, burning the eyes and making it hard to spot the creatures before they were upon you. My attempt to flee was cut off when an oni broke through the wall of a building. It reveled in the destruction and began to attack and rape the people around it. We tried to get away, but it caught up to us easily, swatting us to the ground with bone-breaking blows from its hand or club. I fell to the street hard, head striking the slick pavement and all became blackness. When I awoke, I found I had landed in a pool of the ogre's cum and had been transformed into a monster like it because of it.'";
	say "     He pauses again, looking down on his strong, meaty hands with their clawed nails and bright red skin. He balls them up into fists before taking a deep breath and relaxing. 'I was thankfully overlooked by the monster. I would not want my first to have been that horrible creature. The others it had attacked were gone, their clothes torn to shreds and demon cum everywhere. I realize now they have probably become more like it, but unable to contend with the dark urges and lusts which took them over.' He shifts uncomfortably on the floor and presses a hand to his tiger-skin loincloth. 'Thankfully, I am menacing enough in appearance that most of them give me a wide berth and do not trouble me.'";
	say "     Despite his fearsome face and gruff voice, there's a sadness to them as well. As you grow used to his appearance and his voice, it becomes a little easier to read the true emotions beneath them. 'You should perhaps go now. I thank you for the company; it is good to speak to someone again. But now I need to meditate.' You consider trying to talk to him longer, but decide to leave as he's requested.

His heartbeat can be felt almost humping against your palm, a strong and powerful one, as you give him a few gentle rubs across those large pectorals. He lets out a very faint, nearly inaudible moan, as you brush your fingertips across one of his red nipples, his need for stimulation building as his unsatiated arousal grows.

It twitches and unleashes a healthy gush of precum, which you lap up eagerly.

The oni's transformed manhood is a thick pillar of red flesh, hard and throbbing with need. While shaped like a man's cock, it is considerably larger and thicker with throbbing veins. It is a little over a foot in length and leaks precum steadily. Like the rest of him, it is a bright red in color, only darkening to a near-black shade of red at the glans. Below it hangs his ponderous ballsack, containing his large, firm testicles.

			say "     'Show some respect to your better and ride that cock like I know you want it, you slut,' Hayato growls as he reaches around to pump at the demon ogre's drooling erection. Between being fucked by Hayato and that hand stroking him off, the oni's struggles cease quickly and his hips press all the harder against Hayato's, welcoming each thrust from the increasingly dominant oni.";
			say "     This release of Hayato's inner oni leads to quite the powerful release from the big guy, his oversized balls pulsating as they unleash blast after blast of thick semen into his foe. When this causes the oni between you to cum as well (his load barely half what Hayato can produce), Hayato mocks him again for being a weak slut before grabbing your around the waist and pulling you into a forceful kiss. His tongue delves into your mouth even as he floods his foe's ass with his hot load. Once the victorious oni's done and pulled his cock free, the oni beneath him is left too worn out from his struggles and the buggering and passes out.";

There's the remains of sandwich fixing, open packets of drink mix and the plastic wrapper for a picnic basket. You're strangely disappointed at having missed them, but relieved as well. Certainly Hayato's seeming much more confident for having gone face to face with his infection. You gather up the remaining supplies you can salvage from the mess and head back to the bunker together.";

That felt so good to take charge like that and take what I wanted.' He gives your ass a firm squeeze and grinds his crotch against your side, throbbing with growing need. 'How about we do things my way on occasion?' he asks with a lustful growl. From the look on your face you clearly have no objection with this train of thought.";
