Section 1 - Creature Responses

to say Wyvern Patriarch Wins:
	if HP of Player > 0: [player submitted]
		say "     As you recall the big wyvern saying that he would show you mercy if you submitted, you do so, falling to your knees and begging him to not murder you. He looks down at you in disbelief as you plead for your life or something similar. 'Murder?! What kind of basic creature do you think I am?! No, never! I wouldn't dirty my talons for such a savage and deplorable act. But you do need to be taught a lesson!' As you look up at the massive beast, he prepares a thick volley of goop, which lands directly on top of you, pinning you down under that thick substance and denying you any movement. 'Now, let's just properly keep you still while I consider what to do with you. A worthy punishment, perhaps, but since you were so eager to oblige, I might actually amuse myself instead.' The grand wyvern considers his next actions as you remain helplessly stuck in his goop, awaiting your fate...";
	else: [player fought]
		say "     You attempted to fight back, but to no avail. The wyvern is obviously much stronger than you, so eventually, one last strike brings you down as you collapse on the ground, looking up at the massive beast as he prepares a thick volley of goop. Too weak to even attempt to dodge it, he lands his attack right on top of you, pinning you down under the thick substance and unable to move. 'Would you just stop moving, imbecile! I must administer your punishment as it is duly deserved! Now, how can such a large and almighty being like me use to truly remind you of your place?' The grand wyvern considers his next actions as you remain helplessly stuck in his goop, awaiting your fate...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     To your shock, the large beast places himself just above you, that large body of his soon almost completely obscuring your view as you find yourself almost between the wyvern's legs. Then, as you look up to his face, which is staring right back at you with a grin, the winged wyrm's cock begins to show itself, a massive red dong that continues to extend itself towards a nearly unimaginable size. He takes no hesitation to begin to shove it in the goop that surrounds you, replacing most of it with the presence and weight of his titanic dick. Luckily, you are still able to withstand the sheer force of the wyvern's giant shaft without being utterly crushed by it, so big that whenever the beast thrusts forward, your vision is completely obscured by it. 'Since you love to get your hands on my sons' parts, I shall give you something truly noteworthy to sate your cravings.'";
	say "     Even as you push against it, his heavy cock battles your strength with ease and keeps you stuck between itself and the goop, only throbbing harder at every movement you make. Everytime you touch its warm body, it seems to pulsate as if yearning for more. Knowing that you will not make it out of here until the massive wyvern is fully satisfied, you think that, perhaps, the best move would be to submit to him and oblige his orders, which seem evident. 'Or is that too much for you to handle, I wonder? You've got a real wyvern here and you cannot even bring yourself to pleasure him properly?! Get to work, fool! I'm not letting you go until I find myself satisfied with your performance.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You give it a kiss and try to wrap your legs and arms around the very girthy shaft, giving it your best attempt at further pleasing the wyvern, and he keeps grinding it against you, steadily. Its size only leaves you able to stretch your limbs, barely even hugging the massive meat as you feel it rubbing against your entire body. The only thing that gives you enough room for movement is his precum mixing with the goop all around you, making it more slimy, slippery, gel-like and less sticky, actually serving as a good lubricant. His grunts make your entire body vibrate with their deep grumbling, but is a sign of good appreciation for what you are doing. 'Well, you're not half-bad after all... At least when you're trying.'";
	say "     Despite the wyvern's sarcastic remarks, you can tell you are doing a decent job at stimulating him, the huge cock now giving out more throbbing than before, so you pick up the pace. He does not stop you, encouraging you, even. 'Such enthusiastic moves... One who'd look and see you could say you're actually enjoying this.' He teases you, but your sole objective is to get him off so you can escape, a task that seems to take longer than you would expect. 'You'd better not be rushing it, I do like to take my time...' As it seems to be useless to get any faster than this, that with the resistance the goop around you offers against your movements, you only rub and work it with your entire body just enough to keep him happy.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     He definitely does not seem to be joking when he says he likes taking his time, as you have kept your arms and legs wrapped around his massive dong for quite a while now, ending up soaked in both his precum and the goop. 'Hope you're not getting tired now! I was actually growing closer... Though I'm still wondering if I should risk drowning you in my load. Yet, you do seem to be a resilient individual, so that shouldn't be a problem for you, right?' Your ordeal does not last for much longer, even as he talks, as it seems you have been edging him for a while now. His cock remains unbelievably solid, but soon begins to throb dramatically, making your whole body shake along with it. 'Oh, you've made it... Here you go...!' Then, the massive wyvern pulls back enough to aim his dick's head at you...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     This massive surge of cum hits you right on the face, the first gush being enough to blind you and make you choke for several moments before he thrusts forward, firing the rest of his massive load right into the mixture of precum and goop, then enveloping you in a huge mixture and mess of thick juices. As both substances seem to merge with one another, the whole thing comes down as just creamy liquid, making a puddle around you without actually submerging your body in the stuff. For like a whole minute, his spurts are so huge and heavy you can even hear more of his load falling onto the ground in loud splashes, all this happening while the wyvern just roars in ecstasy, having successfully humiliated you and being quite proud of that.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	if vorelevel is 3: [CV scene]
		say "     But even after his orgasm, the massive wyvern does not seem satisfied, grunting about as he persistently continues to rub his cock on your body, his meat refusing to soften. He does not seem annoyed, however, only more increasingly horny, which begins to worry you. 'You know what... I'm not entirely satisfied yet. I don't think your punishment strikes me as complete. You enjoyed this too much.' He then looks down at you, mischief evident in his reptilian muzzle, and slides his manhood all the way down until its tip is facing your feet. You blink as you attempt to understand what he wants, and then, he thrusts forward to bring that mostly flat head over your soles.";
		say "     Then, his slit begins to widen as he pokes your feet with it, pressing against them as you still struggle to free yourself from the messy trap he got you in. 'I've got just the thing for a mischievous imbecile like you... Just fitting.' Suddenly, one of your feet happen to slide into the gaping orifice, and then, his cock begins to throb, gushing out this slippery precum all over you, once more. Your other foot also sinks into his cock by the time you look back at it, and it is then that you realize the large wyvern's intention. You try to pull it out, but it is too late, as he still has complete hold of you. Another throb and your ankles are caught in it. 'There is no escaping me, fool! You belong to me!' The pull his cock has on you is so great that, with each additional throb, you feel yourself being dragged deeper inside it...!";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Now, it has managed to pull you up to your knees, and the large creature's hungry giant cock continues to swallow you, inch by inch. Your body slowly slides in deeper, threatening to fully disappear into the girthy and vast shaft that yearns for you. No amount of thrashing can stop you from being down to your chest and beyond, its slit having slurped you in a way that only leaves your head out, its fleshy walls constricting you from all around you and moving in an almost peristaltic fashion... You cannot stop the inevitable. The last thing you feel before you are fully enveloped in warm and moist flesh is the slit itself closing in around your face and head, leaving you in complete darkness as you are forced to travel through the giant shaft.";
		say "     Your ordeal is yet far from ending, it is more like a beginning. With his prey - so, you - captured and slowly being pulled towards the beast's internal gonads, the wyvern feels content enough to set off and fly around with you still inside him. Eventually, you are dropped inside his cum factories, almost purposefully of the right size to accomodate your arrival. Thick jizz sloshes around you and quickly overwhelms you as you have no other choice but to let some of it in your mouth. This space is tight, moist and very hot, rapidly making you sweat while you are in here, trapped inside the wyvern's orbs as he flies around, as if to continue to torment you for his own personal enjoyment.";
		say "     'Well, and if you think I've never done this before, think twice! I'll keep you in there until you've had time to regret having messed with me and my sons! Your own personal jail for your petty crimes against my kind! I hope you enjoy it, ant.' You spend the next moments feeling the whole world around you bounce around, cum washing you for hours, stuck in these tight and warm confinements for who knows how long. Eventually, it is just too much for you to endure, so your senses decide that the wyvern definitely had his way, his much wanted victory, and black out from the physical ordeal.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		follow the turnpass rule;
		follow the turnpass rule;
		say "     You do not know how long it has been, but eventually, you open your eyes and find yourself in the ground, covered in cum, bruised and weakened, waiting for your own strength to return. It takes a while until you manage to catch your breath and clean yourself of the substantial mess this large wyvern has made, then set off to search for your stuff. Luckily, he has delivered you in about the same place as where you met him...";
	else:
		say "     Satisfied with his revenge, the wyvern looks down at you in contempt and proceeds to take off, his giant dong flapping around before it recedes back to its scaled confinements... 'I am satisfied. For now. So be sure to behave in my absence. If I ever see you again, you can bet I'll have my way with you, and I may not be so gentle. Farewell, ant.' He then takes flight, the sheer force of his wings swooping the air almost blowing you away as he rises up, to leave this area. Still soaked in a mixture of sticky liquids, you take only a while to be able to get up and search for your stuff in order to get out of here.";

		say "     With your lewd display of skill, quite literally, the big wyvern's movements become more and more sluggish, as he seems increasingly distracted by what he sees. 'Who... Who fights like this?! S-showing off their... Their indecency! Instead of fighting properly!' By further teasing him, you manage to incite his confused wrath as he launches a volley of goop towards you, something he does not seem to do too frequently, but he does a terrible job at aiming. Most of it fails completely, with only a little bit of it sticking to your leg by pure chance. You do catch a glimpse of what seems to be his cock - and what a massive thing that is - protruding right from between his legs in an embarassing, but grand, erection. It seems you did manage to turn him on...";
		say "     'Grr! I... Why are you...?! T-this is impossible!' It would seem the large wyvern is stuck in an incredulous state as he observes you walking towards him. Something in his mind must be making him stay instead of attempting to flee, confused about how he came to be in such a situation, where he does not know if he has truly lost the fight or is just too distracted with fantasies previously unknown to him. One thing is certain, that massive cock of his stands proudly erect, throbbing and leaking, right before you, showing the effectiveness of your tactics.";

	else:
		say "     You have seen to be able to deal some damage to the large wyvern, who roars in agony as you prove to be a quite more challenging foe than he thought you would be. 'How can such a puny vermin like you face the likes of me with such incomprehensible competency?!' Out of rage, he launches a volley of goop towards you, something he does not seem to do too frequently, and you barely manage to dodge it all with only a little drop of the stuff sticking to your leg. 'AAAARGH! You're insufferable! Know that this is not our last meeting. I shall take my revenge on you, sooner or later, and you'll have no way to avoid what's coming for you! I shall not give way to your petty strugglings the next time I lay my eyes on you, creature!'";
		say "     Unable to completely subdue the large wyvern, you can only watch him take flight to flee. Would you have it another way, you would take advantage of him and his sizeable body, if you so wished, but alas, it seems this confrontation was not enough to weaken the winged wyrm for that purpose. Were you even expecting to be able to physically overpower him? Perhaps there are other ways to convince a hothead to stand down, unless you genuinely enjoyed kicking his ass instead. One could also say it was for mere survival necessity, but nonetheless, an incredible achievement.";
