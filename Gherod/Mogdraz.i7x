He's wearing a leather set, complete with a spiky harness adorning his jacked torso, a leather jockstrap suitable for his enormous size, a pair of crotch revealing leather pants and black boots, adorned with a few chains here and there, and to accessorize, some piercings on his left eyebrow and ear, giving him quite an edgy look.

We are extradimensional to you, as you may have already realized. My kind comes from the hot depths of Hell, forged like titans from the hottest volcanoes, and we were made remarkably close to dragons, with the ability to bend fire at will. Of course, we were also made extremely attractive, in my opinion... But of course, charm isn't always the only outcome out of our image.

My kind is not [']infectious['] per se, as you call it, as any direct interaction with them doesn't force your body towards any change.

But any other part that is split from us, which would be the equivalent of splitting part of you from your immunity system, becomes vulnerable to the infection, and the nanites adapt into the closest strain possible to the part's former owner in order to provide a significant change.'";

Obviously I've made my homework before I established a business in this chaotic place. Imagine if my demons and I were vulnerable to this apocalypse? But I know you want to know how I know all of this, rather than why... I do have my ways to gather all the information I seek. Spy imps, informants, irrefusable deals... There's always a way.

And once we had the rebellion, in which I had to leave, I simply offered Xaedihr a chance to escape, if he wanted.

They could have several uses, but unfortunately, what little information we have on them is not enough to seek this route. This is why my contact appears to demand secrecy, because they think they are in possession of a method to grow these trees without tainting any living creature. If that fell in the wrong hands, you can imagine the dimension this blight would gain.' But why wouldn't Mogdraz simply order a consistent harvest from the Dry Plains, you ask.

	say "     As you both walk away from the Club, Mogdraz turns to you. 'In fact, I have to, yet again and very sadly, say that we cannot have any of those fun times today, the ones I suggested. It looks like things went a little awry, regarding yesterday's matter, and I have to stick close in case anyone gets into some kind of trouble. Though, this does not mean I dare to waste your time for absolutely nothing! Fancy a good meal, by any chance?' he asks you, and in fact, free food is never a bad thing to have, so you nod and wait for whatever he has to say. 'So, some of my lackeys have a secret spot they have arranged to meet, rest and... drag any fortunate passerby for a good time, if you catch my meaning.'";
	say "     You ask if he did not really mean [']unfortunate['], and he laughs at the question. 'Would that be unfortunate to you, having a bunch of big, horny and handsome demons all over you? They're not brutes, and can actually be competent lovers, so I doubt that you'd find that unpleasant. You deviant.' he teases you, chuckling to himself. Whether that is true or not, you both know the answer. 'Anyway, this spot is in a quite well hidden section within the District, and is also one of the outposts we use to cruise information with the Club in relative safety. We can't exactly have scout imps flying into an underground area, correct? So we have also established an outside base, close by. Toron manages it on his own, as his room connects directly to this hideout.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     This is quite clever, and you can imagine that their illusion spells are quite effective at keeping their location safe. 'The initiative was, actually, indeed, from one of my lackeys. I suppose they aren't all himbos, though most of them are... So, shall we get going?' With a nod, you let him know that you can go to this place. 'Indeed, we shall head there immediately. It's... just around the block.' Both you and Mogdraz start walking into an alley linked to the Crimson Street, but to the northern side, just next to the Club. These areas are a bit more unfamiliar to you, and usually, nothing goes on around here, which makes it a perfect spot for a shelter, actually.";
	say "     Like the Demon Lord said, just around the block you find several makeshift walls and roadblocks, making it look like some sort of bandit camp. Naturally, the spell is not hiding it from you, though you imagine that this looks quite like an ordinary abandoned place to any outsiders who have no access to any of the Hellfire facilities. Inside, several Hellfire Demons seem to be hanging out, quite calmly, and this base extends further into the building which seems like it was previously some sort of coffee shop. This comes to show that the Hellfire Club's internal network seems to be way more complex than it shows at first glance, and you cannot help but commend Mogdraz for such an impressive establishment. 'I, uh... have done my best, of course, to maximize efficiency and comfort for my kind. At first, we did not know how safe this world would be for us.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'And we still don't know... What will happen when the other humans arrive? I haven't the faintest clue on how to act once the military comes and retakes the city...' Mogdraz makes a fair point. After all, demons and magical creature were not a thing, or at least as much of a thing, before the nanites. Their decline and disappearance from the ancient times to the modern world has made them become mere myths, which would now return as a daily reality. 'Maybe we'll have to retreat entirely, if we don't manage to adapt to a more lively Red Light District... Though I don't suppose your entire world is ready to accept the existence of extradimensional demons with powerful magic abilities without wanting to bring us into immediate scientific experimentation. I don't think any of my lackeys would like to be a lab rat...'";
	say "     During your conversation, the Demon Lord orders someone to bring food and a drink over to you, as he leads you to a place inside the building to take a seat with him. One of the red devilesses comes with a plate of warm steak and fries, quite decently made. Mogdraz thanks her as she takes her leave to do something else. 'I hope that isn't too bad. I've no idea about what kind of food humans like to eat, most of the times. You seem to eat several different things, it just gets too complicated to tell what is edible from what isn't.' You let him know that what he has offered you is a quite common dish, though you have to know which meat this is, as you are having some trouble identifying it... 'Uh... I haven't the faintest idea. Maybe just eat it if it tastes okay? I don't know...'";

Demons feed from life force, after all.' Right, he manages a business in which many of his clients are, or were previously, humans. 'However, who doesn't just drink a glass of some good beverage for its taste alone? We do the same thing and process whatever we consume the same way you mortals do, apart from some natural differences, I'd assume.

The Demon Lord's eyes widen, and then he frowns an eyebrow as his voice raises to intimidating decibels. 'And what might you want, you preposterous imp?! Are you offering yourself as dessert?!' he asks, and demands an immediate answer from the tiny demon. 'Eeek! N-no need to be so angry, boss! I-I... I merely come to deliver a message!' Impatient, the Demon Lord crosses his arms and gives the imp a very fierce look. 'Speak. At. Once.' he says, each word with a clear pause and pronounciation.";

Y-your request has been planted successfully! Wait, no, not [']request['], it was another word... P-Plan? No, no... Or was it not [']planted['] that he meant?' You begin to feel very sorry for the imp as Mogdraz raises his hand, slowly, as the tiny devil speaks, then the last thing you see before it is sent flying out through the window is a swipe of his hand, ending in an explosive thud that leaves a bit of smoke hanging in the air. The imp screeches as he disappears out of view.";

But very well, I will not assign [italic type]it[roman type] to permanent living sex toy duty.'";

	say "     It is quite obvious that Mogdraz does not appreciate imps that much... You can kind of see why.";
	say "     After this incident, you and Mogdraz get up and begin to leave, as he offers to accompany you back to the Crimson Street. 'Sadly, I cannot linger for much longer. I must meet Toron and see if everything has been arranged as I requested. But of course, once I've taken care of this matter, we could arrange some more meetings like this? And we definitely need to do the fun ones! It's unfortunate that I got stuck with issues like these... but I promise, I'll make it up for you.' You are left to wonder what the Demon Lord means by this, but supposedly, it is something good.";
	say "     So, you stand up and begin to walk away from the area, through the other demons outside as they salute their boss on your way out. 'I hope you've, at least, enjoyed your meal? I could procure something better, if you have any particular tastes. They always make fine gifts, as well!'

The air around you heats up as he presses his body against yours, very tenderly, grabbing your hand with his, with all your fingers intertwining.

Much the same happens to the devil, whose erection threatens to tear through his dark leather pants and keeps on throbbing against you. Yet, you continue to make out with each other, your minds connected and sharing the pleasure among the both of you, something you have never experienced the same way as you do with him.";

With this, you learn that the Demon Lord loves having his balls played with, once you get your hands on them and fondle them gently, nearly making the devil moan as a few generous drops of precum come dribbling down his shaft.";
			say "     With such a wonderful piece of meat, you cannot resist it for much longer. Your mind keeps screaming at you to take it and lay your lips on that throbbing penis, and soon, you are gobbling up on the by now rock hard demonic cock with veins pulsing as blood flows through the whole cavernous body, only making that dick feel and look even bigger. All Mogdraz does is stand there, feeling your warm mouth overtaking his meatlog, almost crying out of pleasure as his so desired love interest kisses, licks and sucks his cock, having built up so much lust that not even he can confidently withstand. There are copious amounts of precum coating your lips and mouth by now, so much that you feel obliged to swallow some of it, and it tastes so sweet that you definitely do not mind gulping down some more.";

Though, the fact Mogdraz comes at a loss of words while observing you worshipping his sizable cock, as you work around every bit and corner of the long and thick piece of crimson meat, and how it just won't stop leaking... is simply exhilarating. You keep a good a hold of his massive pair of testes and you can almost feel the cum sloshing inside them, as they have gotten so full only during this short period of time. A little squeeze also causes him to leak even more, enough to look like an average load of a normal human. 'P-please, it is already difficult enough to hold it in and not embarass myself too soon...!' He lets out another moan right as he finishes saying that, feeling your hand squeezing his balls again as you work on his monstrous demon cock. 'Y-you...!' Yes, you cannot help but show a hint of a mischievous smile on the corner of your mouth, that he clearly notices.";
			say "     'So that's how you want to play it...' he says...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You think you may have unleashed the beast, as you look up and see him grinning. 'If you want it that badly... Allow me to provide.' And just like that, his hands get a good grip of your whole skull, and he makes you look at him. Your eyes are locked onto each others, once more, and he begins to slide his member deeper in your mouth. 'Hands on the balls, now. You'll want to feel them unload, trust me.' he orders, and that really is one devilish grin that sends you heart skipping a beat. Nothing else comes to warn you of what follows next, and that is your throat being wrecked over by a massive demonic cock that comes ramming right down through it as you are held in place.";
			say "     Either you regret provoking him or not is up to you, but it definitely will not be enough to stop the fury of a horny Demon Lord who decides to fuck your face as if you were his personal fleshlight. 'You want to be naughty, again...?' he teases you, chuckling as he fills your mouth with so much cock you feel your jaw will break at any given point, and continues to thrust into you like a battering ram. And very soon, you being to feel his balls rise right under your hands, his whole manhood shaking with antecipation, building up for that powerful first shot... 'Well, guess what that's earned you...' Mogdraz really makes his deep voice sound menacing and intimidating as his load comes very, very close to burst through...";

I do have something that could use some tugging...' he says, but before you have time to think that he's talking about his dick - which could be true, nonetheless - he pulls you gently and lets you sit by his right side on the velvet red sofa. Then, you feel his powerful arm embracing you as he reaches over for a kiss. Quite unexpectedly so, you barely have time to process that a big demon guy is making out with you right here, out in the open for everyone to see, the entire scene making your heart beat at an incredible rate.";
	say "     He pulls his lips from yours for a while, taking a moment to stroke your cheek, bringing his hand to your face from around your shoulder. His muscular leg is bumping against yours, and [if scalevalue of player < 4]as there is a considerable size difference between you and him, you feel completely overtaken by the large devil's heat against your skin[else]you feel his heat against your body[end if], a sign of desire and arousal pulsing through him as much as an obvious erection is forming underneath his dark jockstrap. Taking you for another kiss, your tongues mingle together for brief moments before he lets you take a breath, whispering in a deep and velvety tone 'You can touch me... Don't be shy.' With this said, he actually encourages you by bringing your hand over to his hairy pecs, adorned by a black leather harness, from where you can start moving your touch lower...";

'Might as well take these off...' he says, sliding down the piece of underwear as his monstrous cock is slowly released from underneath its confinements. The fine piece of meat is still hardening before your eyes, getting bigger and thicker by the second. He looks down at you, caressing your ear affectionately, and asks you 'Get a good grip around it... And stroke it for me, will you?' You can't help but feel aroused at this point, looking at his member that is by now fully engorged and ready for action, with your fingers at just a mere few inches from touching. With his request given, you move your hand over his shaft, then wrap your fingers around it, ripping a soft moan out from the sexy devil's mouth. 'Mmh... Fuck... That feels really good...'";

'You're a little tease, aren't you...? That's alright... I like it when you take your time...' While he continues to rub the back of his hand across your cheek and the same side of your head and neck, you're rubbing his cock instead, and figure it's probably for the best if you feel up his great sized balls, too. Sliding your index finger underneath his entire sack, you bring the rest of your palm to cup one of his gonads, which is already enough to fill a hand.

His dick throbs really hard as you're doing this, unable to hide the great pleasure he is experiencing from your caressing. Though enough is enough, and soon your hand is back to his throbbing rod, stroking it with ample movements. With such a considerable length, you actually have to work with your arm much more than with an average dick if you want to fully please Mogdraz with a well-made handjob. Eventually, you want to be using both hands - as there is plenty of dick for that - so the big demon leans back and lets you work. Eyeing you with interest, he compliments your dedication. 'As devoted to the task as you are... Mmh... Might have to consider a full-time job... just so you can keep pleasing me like this...'";
	say "     His sweet words are tempting to drag into reality, but you don't let them bring your focus down. Instead, you're giving his entire manhood enough rubbing and friction to keep pulsing with desire, and precum lubricating the tip and leaking down to his shaft. The stuff ends up in your fingers, though all the better to help your hands slide up and down easier. He's breathing deeper and at a faster rate, patting your head in the meanwhile, making you think for a second that he's pushing it towards his dick, but he's respectful about it. He simply rubs the back of your head as a sign if affection, observing your movements and smiling at you, though not without biting his lower lip. Excited and as horny as you've got him, you stop your hands for a tad bit, only to see him jerking his hips to continue to feel that sweet pleasure. 'Damn... You're getting me...'";

With this much teasing from your side, and his load building up at an alarming rate inside his balls - you even think they have grown a bit during this time - he has grown desperate for a release. Perhaps you should think about giving it to him, and there's not a better way than sliding one of your hands back to his balls as the other keeps stroking the enormous cock. 'Yess... Oh, that will make me cum, for sure... Fuck...' he moans, his breathing intensifying as you, too, pick up the pace and start stroking him faster. With the combined efforts of both your hands, Mogdraz is soon brought to the edge as he warns 'I'm close...!' You fully commit to your actions, making sure you never stop until he's shooting.";

He's cumming for basically a full minute, coating his muscular body and your hands in his creamy hot seed. His balls surely are competent cum factories, to be able to put out so much each time he comes. 'Hell... this was phenomenal... You're good with your hands! Better than most... I wish I could keep you.' he says, stroking your chin and planting a kiss on your lips. 'Right, I've got to ask Tor'on to clean this up. I'm sure anyone eager enough would lick all this cum off, but he has a way with cleaning that just leaves things absolutely pristine. Great employee.' he tells you, laughing at the mess you made him do.";

You liked its taste?' he asks, jesting, but he gestures at you to come closer, and on your knees. With his large hand, he caress your cheek and nearly takes you for an embrace with his powerful legs, letting you position yourself in front of his growing bulge, still covered by the dark jockstrap he's wearing. 'Feel free to unwrap it whenever you're ready. Or you can just admire the view for a while. I'll allow.'

His monstrous cock enlarges before your eyes and it's not even free yet, as you're still taking a grip of the underwear's elastic band and pulling it down. The big demon helps you, lifting himself just enough for it to slide down his ass and allowing you to finally pull his manhood out, only now able to grow to its hardest state. His musk is at its strongest here, too, hot and intoxicatingly arousing, a strong masculine scent like you very rarely feel.

You must love his cock, worship it, make him feel like he's having the damn best blowjob he ever had, fully devoting yourself to please him with the best of your abilities. This comes with taking your time to feel every inch of the huge beast of a cock that he has, and using your hands to provide him additional warmth and friction. Starting by rubbing along his shaft, your tongue follows the long way that goes from the base of his shaft to the tip, with a bit of teasing around the glans, which leaves the big devil biting his underlip.";

You can only maybe suck on them partially, though this is enough to make Mogdraz let out a moan. 'You really made me wait for it, huh... Fuck, that feels so good...' The red devil never dismisses the chance of getting his balls worked on, and as full as they are, you're predicting a very large load once you're done. But for now, you haven't even gotten started on sucking his dick for real. There's still a lot of manhood to enjoy, from his balls to the tip of his cock, before you wrap your lips around his shaft.";

Spreading your lips around the by now glistening wet tip, you allow his crimson rod to enter your mouth. Though it's far from easy, you have to really open wide in order to have a remote chance at sucking him off. He enjoys seeing you struggle with his size, and you can definitely feel his dick throbbing in your grasp as he observes you. 'Reminds me of our first time. You could barely get the tip.' he mocks you, giving out a chuckle, but you don't let this discourage you, and he knows that you won't be. Leaking as he is, the marvelous taste of his precum is the most prominent feeling, one that simply keeps you hooked up.";
	say "     By rubbing the rest of his shaft, you provide a thorough sensation that doesn't disappoint, while you suck as deep as you're able. Mogdraz is often careful as to not push your limits too much, but you know he really wants to drill your mouth with that beast of a dick, if he could. He grabs your head and often pushes you, just a little more, truly enjoying the feeling of his meat going deeper, even if for just a tiny bit, with just the right amount of force. 'You do so much better than most sluts who... fuckin['] beg to suck my cock... Oh, if I could keep you...' he tells you, which you take as a compliment, and proceed to suck on his dick even more hungrily, a bit of sloppiness inevitable as you attempt to take more in you, all the while you're stroking his shaft for maximum stimulation.";

	say "     While you're down there worshipping his cock, the demon boss holds your head gently as you work him towards the edge, encouraging your sucking. There's even a hint of movement on his hips as he's getting closer, and to reinforce that, you fondle his sizable gonads while his meat throbs in your mouth. Then, as you're taking a pause, you begin to lick an especially sensitive spot just around the glans of his penis while stroking the rest of his shaft with your free hand. 'Ohh, fuck... that's it... keep going, yess...!' he exclaims, and you just know you'll get an enormous faceful of cum if you have to keep doing this until he gets there, though you can't really help it. The way he's looking at you, so lustful, biting his underlip, eyes struggling to keep open, his powerful hand caressing the back of your head... it's impossible to resist.";

You actually have to hold your breath and close your eyes as your face, neck and chest get completely covered in the stuff, and Mogdraz only stops cumming after it has been like a minute or so, panting deep with his head leaned backwards in absolute bliss. Only then he takes a look at you, as his dick gives some final throbbings. 'I really, really should stop you from leaving. Looking as good as you do with so much of my cum on you... I feel like I can get hard again in just a few.' he says, directing some of his load into your mouth. It's actually one of the best things you've ever tasted...";

'Don't worry, he'll get you all pristine looking in a pinch.' says Mogdraz to you, as a comfort, though those odd tingling sensations around your body whenever he asks you to close your eyes and let him work leaves you somewhat disturbed.
