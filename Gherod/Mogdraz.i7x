He's wearing a leather set, complete with a spiky harness adorning his jacked torso, a leather jockstrap suitable for his enormous size, a pair of crotch revealing leather pants and black boots, adorned with a few chains here and there, and to accessorize, some piercings on his left eyebrow and ear, giving him quite an edgy look.

We are extradimensional to you, as you may have already realized. My kind comes from the hot depths of Hell, forged like titans from the hottest volcanoes, and we were made remarkably close to dragons, with the ability to bend fire at will. Of course, we were also made extremely attractive, in my opinion... But of course, charm isn't always the only outcome out of our image. We were created to strike fear into mortals, make them bow before us and obey... Now, well, that took quite a turn, didn't it?'";

My kind is not [']infectious['] per se, as you call it, as any direct interaction with them doesn't force your body towards any change.

But any other part that is split from us, which would be the equivalent of splitting part of you from your immunity system, becomes vulnerable to the infection, and the nanites adapt into the closest strain possible to the part's former owner in order to provide a significant change.'";

Obviously I've made my homework before I established a business in this chaotic place. Imagine if my demons and I were vulnerable to this apocalypse? But I know you want to know how I know all of this, rather than why... I do have my ways to gather all the information I seek. Spy imps, informants, irrefusable deals... There's always a way.

But it doesn't take a genious to realize I do some side work, right?' It looks like he is going to explain something, but then dives into a silence, breaking it only a few seconds later.

This is why my contact appears to demand secrecy, because they think they are in possession of a method to grow these trees without tainting any living creature. If that fell in the wrong hands, you can imagine the dimension this blight would gain.' But why wouldn't Mogdraz simply order a consistent harvest from the Dry Plains, you ask.

	say "     As you both walk away from the Club, Mogdraz turns to you. 'In fact, I have to, yet again and very sadly, say that we cannot have any of those fun times today, the ones I suggested. It looks like things went a little awry, regarding yesterday's matter, and I have to stick close in case anyone gets into some kind of trouble. Though, this does not mean I dare to waste your time for absolutely nothing! Fancy a good meal, by any chance?' he asks you, and in fact, free food is never a bad thing to have, so you nod and wait for whatever he has to say. 'So, some of my lackeys have a secret spot they have arranged to meet, rest and... drag any fortunate passerby for a good time, if you catch my meaning.'";
	say "     You ask if he did not really mean [']unfortunate['], and he laughs at the question. 'Would that be unfortunate to you, having a bunch of big, horny and handsome demons all over you? They're not brutes, and can actually be competent lovers, so I doubt that you'd find that unpleasant. You deviant.' he teases you, chuckling to himself. Whether that is true or not, you both know the answer. 'Anyway, this spot is in a quite well hidden section within the District, and is also one of the outposts we use to cruise information with the Club in relative safety. We can't exactly have scout imps flying into an underground area, correct? So we have also established an outside base, close by. Toron manages it on his own, as his room connects directly to this hideout.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     This is quite clever, and you can imagine that their illusion spells are quite effective at keeping their location safe. 'The initiative was, actually, indeed, from one of my lackeys. I suppose they aren't all himbos, though most of them are... So, shall we get going?' With a nod, you let him know that you can go to this place. 'Indeed, we shall head there immediately. It's... just around the block.' Both you and Mogdraz start walking into an alley linked to the Crimson Street, but to the northern side, just next to the Club. These areas are a bit more unfamiliar to you, and usually, nothing goes on around here, which makes it a perfect spot for a shelter, actually.";
	say "     Like the Demon Lord said, just around the block you find several makeshift walls and roadblocks, making it look like some sort of bandit camp. Naturally, the spell is not hiding it from you, though you imagine that this looks quite like an ordinary abandoned place to any outsiders who have no access to any of the Hellfire facilities. Inside, several Hellfire Demons seem to be hanging out, quite calmly, and this base extends further into the building which seems like it was previously some sort of coffee shop. This comes to show that the Hellfire Club's internal network seems to be way more complex than it shows at first glance, and you cannot help but commend Mogdraz for such an impressive establishment. 'I, uh... have done my best, of course, to maximize efficiency and comfort for my kind. At first, we did not know how safe this world would be for us.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'And we still don't know... What will happen when the other humans arrive? I haven't the faintest clue on how to act once the military comes and retakes the city...' Mogdraz makes a fair point. After all, demons and magical creature were not a thing, or at least as much of a thing, before the nanites. Their decline and disappearance from the ancient times to the modern world has made them become mere myths, which would now return as a daily reality. 'Maybe we'll have to retreat entirely, if we don't manage to adapt to a more lively Red Light District... Though I don't suppose your entire world is ready to accept the existence of extradimensional demons with powerful magic abilities without wanting to bring us into immediate scientific experimentation. I don't think any of my lackeys would like to be a lab rat...'";
	say "     During your conversation, the Demon Lord orders someone to bring food and a drink over to you, as he leads you to a place inside the building to take a seat with him. One of the red devilesses comes with a plate of warm steak and fries, quite decently made. Mogdraz thanks her as she takes her leave to do something else. 'I hope that isn't too bad. I've no idea about what kind of food humans like to eat, most of the times. You seem to eat several different things, it just gets too complicated to tell what is edible from what isn't.' You let him know that what he has offered you is a quite common dish, though you have to know which meat this is, as you are having some trouble identifying it... 'Uh... I haven't the faintest idea. Maybe just eat it if it tastes okay? I don't know...'";

Demons feed from life force, after all.' Right, he manages a business in which many of his clients are, or were previously, humans. 'However, who doesn't just drink a glass of some good beverage for its taste alone?

The Demon Lord's eyes widen, and then he frowns an eyebrow as his voice raises to intimidating decibels. 'And what might you want, you preposterous imp?! Are you offering yourself as dessert?!' he asks, and demands an immediate answer from the tiny demon. 'Eeek! N-no need to be so angry, boss! I-I... I merely come to deliver a message!' Impatient, the Demon Lord crosses his arms and gives the imp a very fierce look. 'Speak. At. Once,' he says, each word with a clear pause and pronounciation.";

Y-your request has been planted successfully! Wait, no, not [']request['], it was another word... P-Plan? No, no... Or was it not [']planted['] that he meant?' You begin to feel very sorry for the imp as Mogdraz raises his hand, slowly, as the tiny devil speaks, then the last thing you see before it is sent flying out through the window is a swipe of his hand, ending in an explosive thud that leaves a bit of smoke hanging in the air. The imp screeches as he disappears out of view.";

But very well, I will not assign [italic type]it[roman type] to permanent living sex toy duty.'";

	say "     It is quite obvious that Mogdraz does not appreciate imps that much... You can kind of see why.";
	say "     After this incident, you and Mogdraz get up and begin to leave, as he offers to accompany you back to the Crimson Street. 'Sadly, I cannot linger for much longer. I must meet Toron and see if everything has been arranged as I requested. But of course, once I've taken care of this matter, we could arrange some more meetings like this? And we definitely need to do the fun ones! It's unfortunate that I got stuck with issues like these... but I promise, I'll make it up for you.' You are left to wonder what the Demon Lord means by this, but supposedly, it is something good.";

There are lots of alleys in the Red Light District, but you are in this one, right now, in front of the almighty Lord of the Hellfires, mere inches away from him as the devil slowly closes in the distance between you. The air around you heats up as he presses his body against yours, very tenderly, grabbing your hand with his, with all your fingers intertwining.

Before you feel his lips touch yours, evolving into a slow but passionate kiss.

Much the same happens to the devil, whose erection threatens to tear through his dark leather pants and keeps on throbbing against you. Yet, you continue to make out with each other, your minds connected and sharing the pleasure among the both of you, something you have never experienced the same way as you do with him.";

You want to drop down and suck his dick right here, right now, give him the best blowjob you can possibly manage, get a huge load from him and send him happy back to the Club, just the way he deserves for having been such a nice company for you. Naturally, hearing you say all that makes him throb even more. He bites his underlip, locks gaze on you, brings his hand over your cheek once more...

His sack does not disappoint, either, with a pair of orbs as big as lemons, hanging heavily underneath his dick and looking fuller by the second, and with such a soft dark red skin hugging them, you really feel they look inviting and proceed to feel them up.

You keep a good a hold of his massive pair of testes and you can almost feel the cum sloshing inside them, as they have gotten so full only during this short period of time. A little squeeze also causes him to leak even more, enough to look like an average load of a normal human. 'P-please, it is already difficult enough to hold it in and not embarass myself too soon...!'

Naturally, you immediately get your face coated in lady juice as you get under her sex, ready to eat her out with all your love and dedication.

This causes the centauress to moan and dribble another few drops of love juice onto your face as you keep on licking her, not even attempting to resist such pleasurous sensations as the handsome and mighty devil drills her rear. 'Fuck, she's so tight in here... even for a centaur... I imagined you'd want that pussy for yourself... Though tight, there's still so much space to push in...

If you had any doubts, the constant stream of womanly juice leaking out of her, further reinforced by the quality fuck she is getting, is enough to show you how much she loves this.

In fact, you do not have much time to think about this, as you are given plenty to do with the centauress['] desperate attempts at relieving herself by grinding her sizable pussy against you.

He then turns towards you to show it. It is kind of archaic, in appearance, a little rustic, if you could call it that, but it seems to glow with an ominous energy you cannot quite identify. It is also rather strange, in a way that you have never seen anything like it. There is a globe with glowing points that remain in the same position at all times, pretty much like a compass, and is perhaps meant to locate things, though you really cannot tell how you are supposed to tell what you want to seek.";

But it basically shows things and places you want to find as long as this... device has come into contact with said thing. It obviously cannot sense anything it doesn't know, that'd be an admirable feat even for the most knowledgeable of scholars, but alas, until today, this has been the only known form of locator that I've known. In any case, let us proceed, as I know where several of these fruits are and how to avoid the root traps. They don't seem to like hellfire,' says Mogdraz with a determined look in his face, urging you to keep on going until you have made it to one of the areas. This one he pointed out is, actually, fairly close to your current position.";

It looks like you will have to trust him to reach your destination, but it should be without much trouble. On the far side of this small area of tall grass you are now standing on, you see a few trees leading into a sort of hill going further beyond. 'Right there, across that portion of land. We should be able to find at least a few, hidden behind a veil of apparent normality, as they always do. An acute eye is required to spot the differences before you realize too late and fall into a trap, so... Let's just not let that happen. And for that, I'll lead the way!' You do not see why you should not allow the Demon Lord to lead and proceed to, instead, follow him.";

You figure out it is for the best to do as he says. This goes on until you stop in front of a particular tree. A normal one, at first glance, but you do sense an odd thing about it and you cannot quite put your finger on what. Is it its too perfectly shaped apples? The crimson color is so vibrant it inevitably draws your eyes and tempts you to just pluck one away and eat it... Which is something only really good apples do, and even then, while some look amazing on the outside, they may not taste the best. Perhaps this is it.";

Well, at least, in irreversible ways. You see, one who masters the art of shapeshifting is never truly bound by the laws of other transformative effects, because you are able to hold full control of your shape. Thus, when such a thing is introduced into my system, it is actually fueling my ability to change my form, and these new possibilities are significantly affected by what type of transformative effect they carry.'";

You flinch, expecting something bad to happen, but nothing does. 'I would not be so careless to remove a fruit and expect to be caught in a trap I overlooked. You should worry less...' he says, chuckling. 'Although, if you would prefer and now that I have one of these apples, we may relax somewhere and enjoy the peaceful breeze of the plains. Or... We can see what happens if I eat this. Both would be splendid ways to spend time together. What say you?' he asks you, awaiting your answer to make a decision based of it.";

His eyes flare in eagerness as a smile forms across his face, the devil now walking back towards you with the corrupted apple in his hand. Putting a hand over the back of your shoulder, he beckons you to walk with him. 'I knew your curiosity would get the better of you... And that's alright. I don't judge... In fact, I appreciate it.

Without any further ado, he brings it to his mouth and takes a generous bite with a crunch. You watch him chew that piece for a while, looking expectantly at him while he focuses on the fruit's taste. 'Hmm... It is... not bad.

A simple question, you must admit, albeit quite unexpected coming from him and in the current circumstances. 'I don't want you to think of this too weirdly, but I'm finding this rather strange. It is fine if you are not in the mood for such things, however, and we can simply spend the rest of our time relaxing elsewhere.'

He chuckles and looks at you with bedroom eyes, stroking your cheek as he gets really close to you. 'But I do love when it's you doing the unwrapping...' he says, as the bulge in his pants gives out a heavy twitch, drawing your gaze to it almost instantaneously. You do not see why you should not do it yourself, given that he actually enjoys seeing you undoing his pants and sliding them down, and you actually do just that, beginning with the button and the zip on his crotch. The devil continues to eat his apple as he observes you.";

Within a couple seconds, you finally begin to release it from its confinements, that veiny and fat crimson cock slowly finding freedom right in front of your eyes. With this done, you let his pants and underwear fall down through his legs, letting his half-hard shaft and full balls hang freely. To finalize it, you place your hands around his girthy cock and begin to slowly stroke it, the warm log further thickening and steadily growing into a more solid state, rising towards your face in earnest.";

'I'm definitely feeling something... Oooff... You might want to close your eyes and... maybe... give him a kiss...' he says, doing a pulling motion with his hand on your head, though without forcing you closer. With the suggestion being so clear, you eagerly begin to wrap your lips around that thick glistening tip, already able to taste some sweet demonic precum as Mogdraz's arousal increases.";

Got both your hands free, by any chance?' he asks you, and you briefly open your eyes to see a pair of emerging cocks on each side of his own, long and wiggling like snakes in search for something. Your eyes widen as Mogdraz's original dick, still in your mouth, throbs and feeds you a mouthful of precum as you mindlessly bring both your hands to each new manhood, and yet they continue to grow longer... 'So that's what they offer me... tentacle dicks! Fuck, that's hot. How many do you think I could be able to grow?'

'You look lovely like that, surrounded by cock... It'd make a good jerk-off picture, for certain...' The smirk on his face says it all, pure joy in his expression. You feel like you are possibly indulging him in one of his favorite things, which makes you wonder about all the other crazy stuff he has already done elsewhere.";

All this makes the devil breathe in and exhale in evident pleasure. But as the Demon Lord finishes the apple, you feel several more snake-like bodies wrapping themselves around your legs, as it seems he has made at least three more appear...

You feel the mischief in your eyes as you look at Mogdraz's face, seeing his expression coiled in a desperate need of release. As he nears the point of no return, you abstain from providing him with any additional stimulation until he calms down, and keep his orgasm on edge for a little while longer. Immediately, the effects begin to show themselves: those orbs of his doubling in size, his cocks thickening and growing heavier, drooling more as they cannot hold the entirety of his juice within... While the Demon Lord does not beg you to let him cum, his body does. But, maybe, he enjoys the feeling of a torturous and so overwhelmingly pleasurable edging.";

Things show signs of reaching out of control when you see his testicles growing even more before your eyes, cocks growing thicker than half your face, threatening to surround you completely in a cocoon of them if they grow any bigger, very quickly... You almost cannot keep one in your hand as their girth becomes too great for your fingers, and if it continues, you will not be able to provide them enough stimulation to make them cum on demand. They are also becoming stronger, their embrace as strong as real anacondas, steadily becoming more capable of subduing you and break out of your control... 'I know you must be enjoying this, but... There's... magic we should not mess with, too much, and this is one of them...!'

You hear Mogdraz grunting and breathing intensely, his muscles twitching, his frame hulking up and body temperature rising... Now, you are worried, but you cannot stroke him any faster. You are doing your very best, with sweat running down your forehead. Your arms hurt and your brain is struggling to keep the pace you want to give your movements, and just before all is lost, the Demon Lord lets out a different moan... A familiar and much more welcome one. 'C-cumming...! Fuck, cover your face!'";

Fortunately, Mogdraz managed to take hold of your hand before his orgasm knocked you hard on the ground, and you covered your face before you got the stuff up places it should not go in. You feel like you are underwater for a while, the thick globs of demon cum so great that you even feel disoriented in the middle of it all. After a minute or so, it all subsides and you can breathe in relief as Mogdraz immediately returns to his original form. He holds you close, protectively, as you nearly slip on the creamy deluge.";

It did feel great... Too great. Dangerously, addictively great. Is this the kind of intoxicating feeling you mortals experience upon the face of corruption and sin? I don't judge you for giving in... Just don't recommend it.' Now, you are sticky and messy, but there is not much you can do other than do your best to clear your eyes from the stuff, and both you and Mogdraz decide to start walking away from the plains to return to Red Light District.";

The Demon Lord remains silent for a while, thinking to himself, seemingly intrigued by this. 'That would make sense if you were still somehow part of it.

I think I know what we could be approaching... Very exciting! I wonder if it's through here... And if it's what I think.' Mogdraz takes the lead as you follow through more rooms and halls, eventually finding yourselves in a space that creeps through you like a chilling wind. This sensation is, somehow, dispelled by a gesture the Demon Lord makes with one of his hands. 'That explains a lot. Would you say that perhaps this museum is cursed by a dark influence? Well, there is a high chance it is. But, I say, we should proceed anyway and see what's in this room, since we're already here!'";

As you step inside, you glance around and see a quite different scenario from every other room, this one filled with paintings, sculptures and what seems to be tomes atop pedestrals. Besides that, there are deteriorated drawings of pentagrams in certain strategic spots, which indicates that some sort of ritual was performed here long ago. 'Fascinating! It seems they preserved a space used for demonic rituals! I could spend days here! I'm actually curious regarding the demons in your world...'";

I'm also aware they were thought to be mere religious fantasies or associated with psychological diseases, and the biggest monstrosities were commited to people who suffered from such. But you should know better by now... Everything has a degree of truth behind, and regarding demons, most of everything is, indeed, true. They've always existed, and you now see them appear through dimensional tears in your perceived reality. Heaven and Hell are real...' Mogdraz then heads over some tomes and inspects the writings, and upon looking closer, you also see there are actual books in here. Plenty of them, in fact.";

What surprises me is that the orderly beings had things under control for a long time in your history... Sure, many continue to fall into temptation ever since ancient times, but the vast majority tend to wish to follow the righteous path, and your societal constructs support this. I wonder what would happen if, suddenly, the whole humanity shifted their ways of thinking... Giving into sin and hedonism more than their virtues. That'd probably result in a terrible distopia, but it'd be entertaining to observe.'";

Still, a wonderful place if one wants to spend their time learning in less boring ways, since there is so much visual stimulation going on. I suppose that's why museums are popular?

The main feature about this wing is mostly artistic and informational, as there is not much regarding real samples of real things. Fortunately, Mogdraz appreciates art in all its forms, and this is no exception. 'It's quite interesting how similar, yet different, worlds can be. Every realm, every dimension...

I know that it wasn't always like this in my world, the dimensional barriers broke due to some global-scale event, then we had angels and demons take over the entire thing, war surged and all that jazz.

Chuckling, Mogdraz then retributes with a smile before your generous offer, one that he is pleased to receive. 'Well, it's certainly different. And pleasant, might I add, that someone would want to simply show my physique some love and care. I mostly find it peculiar myself since this is merely one of my many forms, but nonetheless... It feels great.' It is then that Mogdraz brings his hands over his harness and proceeds to slowly undo its belts, his fiery eyes now locked in a gaze with yours as you turn your full attention to what you are seeing.";

	say "     Once the whole thing is finally undone, Mogdraz throws the harness to the side in order to fully reveal his muscular torso, flexing every muscle in a way that seems to make each and every single one of them more pronounced and bigger in volume. In fact, you do not think that is how muscles work normally, but a powerful demon such as him would certainly have something in mind to put on a good gun show. 'Well, then... You might approach me, and I promise I won't smother you... much.' Despite the devilish smirk on Mogdraz's face, you trust him to make this a pleasant experience for the both of you, and so, you approach him. With one step after the other, you slowly make your way to just about a few inches of distance from the Demon Lord, who then extends his arms to reach you and pull you to him.";
	say "     'Didn't you want to feel these muscles? Don't be shy now... I've got plenty of those to satisfy your cravings...' With this said, Mogdraz further pulls your head towards him until he manages to plant your face atop one of his pecs, your lips directly aligned to his pierced nipple that is already perked up and yearning for attention. Then, he grabs one of your hands and places it on his abs, after letting go of it to leave it free to explore, or so it highly suggests that. 'That's a good place to focus your attention... Wrap your lips around that meaty nub and roll your tongue all over it, you'll make this demon very happy.' As you feel up the sides of this muscular torso, you heed Mogdraz's request by immediately rolling your tongue around his dumbbell piercings and nipple, trying to find a good room to suck on it.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	project figure of Mogdraz_nakedhard_icon;
	say "     'Mmh, that's it...' He then embraces you, taking both his big arms and wrapping them around your body in a tight hug, his biceps bulging all nicely as you feel at least one of them across the side of your head. Those pecs, which are covered in a pleasant amount of body hair, feel huge and soft against your face when he is not flexing them, and hard and even bigger when he does. You only care about suckling on that meaty nub as well as you can while your hands squeeze, rub and caress his muscular back and sides. All this caressing leads to Mogdraz popping a boner, as expected, and before you know it, he has his huge red cock out of his pants. 'You might have to take care of something down there, too... If you don't mind...'";
	say "     Not wanting to leave any part of the Demon Lord unattended, you once more do as he requests and take one of your hands to grab his manhood by his shaft, then proceed to rub it as you continue tugging on his nipples with your mouth, changing from one to another after spending a considerable amount of time on each. By keeping this stimulation fresh and letting those sensations cool down, you manage to keep Mogdraz pleased, and most importantly, throbbing quite hard down there. You decide to bring your other hand over his shoulder and rub him there as well, causing the devil to lean his head backwards and let out a moan from all the pleasure combined. With the handjob you are also now giving him, you cause him to approach his edging point significantly faster...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'I guess you are determined to make it shoot... And I won't stop you. I only beg of you to continue what you're doing...' And you are happy to heed that request too. With your tongue wiggling all over those nipples, you feel his chest expanding with each deep breath, each pec almost overtaking your head in size, as a consequence of all the joy you are providing him with. The rubs and gentle squeezes around his body only further fuel those pleasant sensations, and everything just adds up in the end, together with your one free hand stroking his long and thick meatlog that yearns to shoot very soon. That time could not come in any better occasion, as his excitement grows so great his climax hits him like a thunder.";
	say "     With his body language as your only warning, you pick up the pace and make him shoot all that load forward, making a mess of the floor as you keep all the stimulation going until the end, taking about half a minute for it to subside as the crimson devil moans and grunts in pure ecstasy. All that demon cum is as abundant as ever, and only at the end of that minute it begins to leak smaller drops, having formed a trail of the stuff from his feet to several more ahead. 'Ooh, that was... most pleasant... A great release...!' he says, thanking you for making him feel as good as he did. Mogdraz then gently grabs your head and gives you a passionate kiss, that demonic tongue of his swimming in your mouth, wrestling against yours before he pulls out, ending with a gente lip rubbing.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Feel free to nurse on my chest anytime you wish, I most assuredly won't refuse your offer,' he says, giving the side of your waist a tap before he finally lets you go. Having left a smile on Mogdraz's face, you are now content to move on.";
