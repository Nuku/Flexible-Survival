'Oh, my... Now that sounds... Hot. Care to go into detail?' Following his request, you tell him everything you know so far. 'Very, very interesting... An angel with a dick, dominating demons on his very own initiative... My, what an interesting find! I must say, I am quite intrigued.' Looks like Toron is very happy that you brought this to him. 'Honestly, I already knew he was lurking around... But hearing it from another person is just something else, especially knowing about the feelings that have been awakened in you. This angel is... Quite attractive, isn't he? And big... We like them big and exotic.' Well, apparently he already knew. Though you have to ask if he wants to do something about him.";

Heaven has such a way to make everything seem boring, if you ask me... No dick or cunt between your legs?! Bullocks.' You take a moment to consider this, as Toron might be about to ask you to lead this attempt at corrupting the angel. 'Well, I would like you to... [bold type]Observe him. From beginning to end. This means you'll have to track him down to his usual hunting grounds[roman type] and be on the lookout. I want to know exactly how he makes the first contacts, how he acts, which powers he has...

That would explain why he's such an angry angel.' says Toron, wondering to himself. 'So... he thinks that he can fuck all demons into submission, and that it will be enough to exact his revenge on them... while being particularly vulnerable to lust, since obviously having a dick is fairly new to him. We're dealing with a fairly more vulnerable seraphim than what I initially thought. Perhaps this one will be easy to... convert. His newfound strength is, simultaneously, his greatest weakness.

While Mogdraz was the great Demon Lord's personal manservant, Araqiel served an Archangel. As you may already know, the purifier was called as such because he could subdue most demons with his much superior might. By mixing elements from the demons into a newborn seraphim, Lord Araqiel was born, with free will and the equipment to engage in sex, two things most, if not all, pure angels lack.' You already had the feeling Araqiel was not a pure angel from the beginning, judging by what Mogdraz said in the dungeon. 'As such, Araqiel earned his title as one of the most powerful angels ever created, a power that could compete with Mogdraz's, and commanding a force of his own. One day, their ways clashed.'";
	say "     You take a seat by the stool as you listen to Toron. 'Araqiel wasn't always so given to carnal pleasure. There was once a time his convictions resided exclusively in Heaven's best interests of supremacy over our world. The Demon Lord Mogdraz served was the main beacon of Hell's position, who claimed to be growing day by day. It was only natural that, eventually, Araqiel would attempt to strike down the Demon Lord, and that is when Mogdraz met the purifier. It was a harsh battle, and I witnessed it all, offering Mogdraz all the backup support I could, but indeed, the angel was incredibly powerful. They fought until both of them were forcingly disarmed and had to wrestle, using their entire bodies in an attempt to emerge victorious. By then, the battlefield was filled with flames and steam, with both taking hits so powerful that even the ground shaked beneath us.'";

	say "     'I do not know what happened, but eventually they stopped. Both were panting hard, bruised and exhausted, lying down naked as what remained of their clothes was shredded to many pieces, hugging eachother. No, no in that way, they simply had their arms wrapped eachother's bodies, but so exhausted they couldn't move an inch. In all my life, I have never seen such a ferocious battle. Then... something happened, as they looked into eachother's eyes. Once they managed to get up, they simply parted ways. No words spoken. Mogdraz remained silent through the entire way back home.' You blink and nod, as if encouraging Toron to continue. 'That is when Mogdraz began questioning his own Lord's ideals, and the way he treated his son. We thought he was simply a demanding man, but the poor boy was forced to train and study hard, without the chance to make any choices by himself. Mogdraz told me that he had the boy crying in his arms, one day. And that was the day everything changed.'";
	say "     When Mogdraz rebelled against the Demon Lord, he took his son with him, and some of the demons that were loyal to Mogdraz followed, including myself. And amidst our journey, we were amazed to find Araqiel asking Mogdraz to join the resistance force. Apparently, Araqiel felt Mogdraz's determination in defending what he believed in, and that made the angel think... Was any of the sides worthy of being followed? Two sides of the same coin fighting endlessly over completely opposite reasons, that's what it was. We didn't want anything to do with that, so we stood our ground.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Eventually, the Demons gained influence over our world, and we were forced into exile. Recently, Heaven also went through an augmentation in power, and that is reason of what happened to Araqiel. They managed to reach him and threw an attempt at converting him back to their side, but they did not succeed completely. This was just before we managed to escape, so Mogdraz felt he was in a pinch. Between having Araqiel betray him inevitably and leaving him back, our big boss decided to keep the angel in a chamber, hidden within the void, where they could not reach. However, he seemingly escaped on his own and followed us through the void, even in his conflicted state, and by the time he arrived, he was fully converted.'";

Turned on as you both are, it doesn't take long until you begin to hump against eachother, or bringing your lips together for a rather sloppy tongue-wrestling in eachothers['] mouths.

The towering fallen angel is a heavily muscular man with vast, black feathered wings adorning his back, dark short hair with red crimson eyes, a clear face and a pale skintone. His hands have dark claws in place of nails at the end of the fingertips, and below his ripped midriff, there's a thick, massive dick fully exposed to everyone's eyes, with a set of already full ostrich-egg sized gonads hanging underneath that seem to fill up even more at the mere sign of slight arousal. Despite this, he still manages to keep a friendly and inviting smile, enticing anyone, including you, to come very, very close to him.";

The towering holy warrior is a heavily muscular man with vast, white feathered wings gleaming with their very own unique light adorning his back, white short hair with bright blue eyes, a clear face and a peachy skintone. Though the one thing that sets him apart from the pure heavenly creatures is the existence of a sizable cock below his ripped midriff, big even for his overall hulking frame, with a set of full goose-egg sized gonads hanging underneath. He wears nothing but his own skin, with his privates exposed to everyone's eyes. He always has that welcoming and friendly smile whenever you come visit him.";

Well, Ah... I'm afraid there's not much to tell, is there? I'm what you see! A big, hung former warrior of the heavens who descended down to earth to punish evil makers into submission! I still love doing that, by the way, but Mogdraz tells me to keep a low profile, so no more hunting for me! Isn't that a letdown?!

Horny little critters.' And yet he keeps talking, while all you can do is nod. 'You know, I enjoy the size difference. I like being huge! I wish I was even bigger, sometimes, although that would be troublesome. You think my wings would be able to carry me if I was even bigger? Yeah, probably not... Hm, gotta think about my priorities. Truth is, I don't know what I want! Do you know what you want?' You simply nod, once more, though not really answering. 'It's hard, isn't it?! Knowing what we want! Well, I know I want to fuck!

That would easily be you... times ten. Tied up and helpless, forced to swallow my cum for everytime I shot, and yeah, you'd have to take every inch of my dick down your throat.

Mogdraz tells me, nothing better than keeping open with your partner so you learn more about eachother! Though is it bad that if sometimes I just want to do the fuck I feel like doing independently of either they want me to fuck them or not? In Heaven, the mere thought of that would guarantee you a kick in the ass, unless it's towards demons. They don't really care what you do to demons.

'Oh, fuck that's hot! Yeah, come over here... And worship this cock...' he answers, and his meaty prick is already growing to a full erection as soon as you finish speaking. Now that he's more than ready to receive your attention, you kneel before him, placing your hand around his balls at first, and feeling the entire area around his junk. You nearly can't believe how good he smells down here, a mix of manly musk and still a hint of heavenly freshness, which makes it feel as sweet as candy. He tastes like one, too, as you put your tongue to work all over his sack, with your other hand slowly stroking around the base of his shaft.";

Then, you're about to slide your tongue from the base all the way to the tip through the underline of his shaft, when he moves a hand over the back of your head. He fights it, the temptation of grabbing you and having his way with you, and simply gives you a gentle tap, a stroke on the cheek, and slides it down over your shoulder affectionately.";

'Why do you do this so well, it shouldn't be allowed by any natural law...' he comments, ending in a moan which he rushes to hold, trying to keep focus on observing you worshipping his cock. Though his jaw drops immediately once you get your lips around the tip, and start pushing it a little. It's a huge one, very hard to open your mouth so wide in order to take all that meat, which is constantly pulsing and begging for your attention.

He's fighting himself so hard, punching the wall behind him slightly, his hips trying their best to not start thrusting and turn this into a hard facefucking session. 'You're driving me crazy... I can't stand this... This is torture... Too fucking GOOD torture...' He pants slightly, letting some breathy moans escape his mouth as he squirms about, all while you suck on how deep you can get of his dong past your lips.

Though figuring you're done with going slow, you proceed to pick up the pace, stroking him quicker, sucking him faster, reaching more of his dick with both your mouth and hands, and giving his massive balls a good squeeze once in a while.

My balls are aching...' he warns you, and all you can do for now is stroke his poor, distended orbs that his corruption twisted into growing indefinitely bigger the more he holds his orgasm in.

One spurt is enough to give you a mouthful of cum, and he just keeps shooting faster than you can swallow! All of his creamy load eventually drops out of your lips after making you choke, completely absurd amounts of it being splattered onto you.

You struggle to keep it out of your nose, and the more you clean up, more falls over you, and if you try to touch his thigh to warn him, he just gets more excited...!

He then plants a kiss on your forehead and lets you catch your breath on top of his muscular body, your head resting against his manly pillows. 'Have a rest before you go...

If he's serious, you're going to be spending a long, long time to lick his whole body clean, with the amount of muscles he has and the corners you have to cover with your mouth.

Tongue wrapped around your shaft, rubbing against the entirety of your cock as he sucks on it harder and deeper, you find yourself being overtaken by a wave of pleasure that sends your load out right then.

Not that I would mind that, though. But [SubjectPro] is a capable person. I mean... Having resisted this apocalyptic place means a lot by itself.'

It's not my fault that whatever wicked experiment those heaven dudes were making turned out to be a [']purifier['] with a big dick.' says Araqiel with a joking tone. 'I am going to ask you to keep the disguise for a while longer.
