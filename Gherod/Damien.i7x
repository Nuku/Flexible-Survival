Do you wanna know what happens to the demons after I capture them? Hehe... You wouldn't wanna be in their place. They're mine, now. I own them! That's what happens if they take you. They enslave you... They turn you their fucktoys and play with you as if you were a sex doll with no will of your own. They corrupt you until you forget everything about what made you human, in the first place! And worse... they claim your soul! So I'll claim theirs, instead!'";

Of course I...' - he then stops, then lets out a sigh before continuing -'Well, I have plans for it, okay? I already have a spot where I'm going to deliver them, and I'm good at making traps! I-I'll catch one! And then teach them the lesson they need to learn!' It is probably for the best to warn him that whatever demon he captures, they would probably enjoy any [']harsh['] treatment he could give them.

It makes you wonder why. 'Yeah... I just let myself get captured by those two twins, to find out where they were taking all those people. Turns out they own a fetish club! But I know, for sure, that they deal with stuff like souls and other things that would pose a threat to the humankind! They are amassing power for a demon revolution, I can feel it!'

With a nod, you let him know that you would like to hang out with him, sometime, and while you are at it, perhaps you can be of any assistance to him. 'Yeah, that'd be great... I... really haven't been too successful at this on my own... Don't get me wrong, I'm quite capable! But these demons are elusive! And they're great at tricking you! You should never trust them, they'll always find a way around you, and they'll know everything about you if you let them too close!'";

I'll be around here, occasionally. Just... pass by and check, you might find me. I know this isn't the best meeting place, but it's discrete and close to our objective...

That is unexpected, to say the least, but it appears that Damien only wants to go on a scavenge run without worrying about any devils or devilesses.

Even more than the garbage behind us... Even the ground is sticky.' he comments, and you think you know what usually takes place here.

With the glass still covering the windows, you suppose this one indeed escaped the eyes of the ransackers. Damien leaves the door open so you can follow after him, and maybe you know why nobody ever came here. The store is mostly empty and very uninteresting, you cannot even quite tell what kind of shop it was... but there is this faint scent of incense still lingering, somehow...";

A place like this should have some good electrical parts still functioning. Could make some neat stuff... Why don't you check that spot over there?' Damien points towards a door left ajar, where you think is a room used to store stuff inside, like personal belongings and such. You see no reason why not to take a look at it, so you walk up to that door, push it open and let your friend shed some light onto the area. There isn't much in here besides some bags with empty boxes and the occasional odd trinket.";

It is a good idea to keep guard, in fact, so you head to the door and wait for him to be done. The next few moments are filled with noises of things falling, metal clanking, and other stuff being forcefully pulled... you think.

I want to see what I can do with what I've got back at my shelter. How about we meet up again tomorrow? Or... whenever you can.' he asks, and you nod, agreeing on consdering it depending on how things go on your end. 'Alright, I suppose we can part ways here, as my shelter is nearby.

But... then it got... more wicked. I wanted to subdue them in a different way.

He then revealed he was infatuated with this demoness escort at the club, and last thing I know, he sold his soul. I was furious... I felt like they stole him from me, as I said.

The reason for this is that we discovered it had certain effects on local citizens, namely... Transformative effects. We actually never concluded it could fully turn someone into a kind of hellfire demon, and given your enthusiasm with your... friend, and how much he loved that drink, we allowed you to continue this investigation for us.

We intervened and offered Iker a deal. He was to continue to encourage Damien to have that drink and indulge his fantasies, and we would make sure he got well-rewarded. The arrangement did not last for too long and Damien would soon find out that Iker was trying to do something to him, thought of him corrupted and left with a grudge on us, understandably so. Iker then went to me and offered his soul, perhaps out of guilt, but I made sure I gave him everything he could ever ask for.'";

Toron was given permission to recommend and serve the drink you have been encouraging Damien to have, and you have not shown any opposition towards it, so we continued to observe your interactions and effects.

You ask them what did that mean, given where this entire conversation is headed. Mogdraz takes over and replies, 'This means Damien ended up trading his soul for permanent residence in the Club, but he remained with a particular interest in you. I've given him status as a hellfire demon, much like every other grunt I employ, but the curious result of this experiment was that he was not turned into just [italic type]another[roman type] hellfire demon, but one of their older forms.

As you begin to realize the true reason of this meeting, you ask Mogdraz if, by any chance, that meant he sort of sold you to this new Damien. 'Sold you?! No, [if Resolution of MogdrazRomance >= 8][italic type]I'd never do that to you! What sort of individual would I be if I betrayed your trust in such a way? I'd have never forgiven myself[roman type][else]it is not like that[end if]... What I did was to merely agree that you could visit him for free and he would have no limits in what he could do with you during said meetings. You are not bound to him, in any way.

You may [bold type]now request to be with him[roman type] whenever you wish to, but you must be [bold type]wary of his acquired power[roman type] due to the deal he made with Lord Mogdraz.

You, on the other hand, if you continue to meet with him, [bold type]we will not be able to protect you from any effects he might have on you[roman type], due to the terms of his deal with Lord Mogdraz.

Mogdraz said I had developed this sort of will bending thing in my eyes during my transformation, and I might have made Iker believe he was into me without really knowing I was influencing his mind. Turns out I was, and then he sold his soul for an eternity of servitude in some random-ass place full of big manly demon dudes. What a fucking buttslut he became... It's kinda funny, right?

Would Toron let you in here if you didn't know of the terms I chose?' he replies, a little perplexed, and you tell him that you, indeed, know of those terms, but they have not told you the full thing, which you would like to hear from him. He sighs, but still decides to answer, 'Yeah... So... Since I was struggling with my mind, I asked Mogdraz to stabilize it.

He also told me of what kind of work he could offer me and I picked escorting, since it's just fucking all the time, so an easy and fun job. I made sure he allowed you to come see me for free, at any time you wanted, but that those stupid rules of his wouldn't apply in our meetings. He agreed to all those terms, so I signed the contract and it was done!

You are not quite sure why you are craving for it so much, but there is something in the air around you, a warmth that evaporates any irrelevant thoughts and leaves only those that matter... to the dragonmorph, at least. Every inch of him, his sculptural body, his size and might, the way he looks at you and draws you in with such little effort... Everything overwhelms you the more you lose yourself in him.";

His foot is still keeping you at a distance, as you continue to feel it pushing against your chest. Damien only grins at your helplessness, knowing the effect he is having on you, but keeps only jerking, a little faster now. In a way, you can also sense his excitement, the power he holds over you feeling intoxicating for him, as if there was a slight empathic link between the two of you.

Damien then brings the hand that he was stroking with to touch yours and slowly pulls it back, allowing you to touch his slick member, whichs gives out a welcoming throb the moment your fingers meet the meat. You are not allowed to touch him anywhere else, nor with anything else other than only this one hand, but you want to jerk him off so bad that you begin to do just that.

Committing to the cause, you move your hand up and down through his big shaft in a rhythm you know Damien will find pleasant, and kind of just know when to do it quicker, followed by how deep and fast he breathes and the moaning he lets out. 'Come in a little closer, bud...' he says, whispering, touching the back of your skull to show you what he means.

You know you should not stop now, under any circumstances, and carry on until his edging point... 'Keep going... I'm almost there...' he warns you, his dick throbbing in anticipation.

The draconic devil's orgasm goes on for a long time until it subsides, and you earn yourself something similar to a cum bath. He laughs once he sees the state he left you in. 'Fuck... That's a lot of cum... Bet that feels really good on you, doesn't it?' Damien looks at you with a smirk on his face watching you covered in his own jizz.

In fact, you think he might even enjoy watching you walk away covered in it, as if marked by him. You are given no other choice but to start walking towards the exit as you say goodbye to him.

It is around eighteen inches in total of hard cock whose pleasure you have to ensure, but judging by the silly happy look in the devil's face, you are doing quite well.

Really good [boygirl]...' he praises you, caressing your cheek before he lays both his hands on each side of your head, but without forcing your movement.

From one point forward, he seems to fully give in to the sensations you are providing him with, a signal that you are doing really good, if you still had any doubts. Now, you must continue to suck his dick, swallow and slurp on it like the expert cocksucker you aim to be, giving it your all with the enthusiasm he deserves and your neck a great workout.

				say "     Your eyes visibly widen, as you have deemed that you are definitely not about to massage anyone's feet right now. Informing Damien of that, you push his feet away and get up to leave. You are not necessarily impolite, but the refusal alone seems to have annoyed the dragon devil. 'Oh well, your loss. Someone else will pay to have an opportunity you have wasted, for free... Guess if you don't wanna follow my rules, then you should probably just stop coming, really. Find someone else.' Feeling at a loss of words, you just remove yourself from Damien's room.";
				say "     Toron appears shortly after to escort you back to the lounge, and not without commenting on how quickly the session went, 'Hm... I suppose it was not to your liking, this time? It's alright. I'm sure Damien will be more open to suggestions in the future. Give it time.' With that, you are returned to the bar shortly after.";

He remains in the same position, except part of his robe has slide over his thigh and... revealed this huge draconic dong already throbbing at full attention, together with the plump crimson sack laying down underneath. Obviously, your attention is drawn to all that manhood immediately. 'Aw, would you look at that... This bad boy here doesn't wanna go down, no matter what I do...' he says, giving it a light slap, causing it to rigidly bounce. 'I tried jerking off between sessions, but I just couldn't stop thinking of you...' He notices your eyes unable to look away, so he spreads his legs and gives you a wider view.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'It's totally your fault, but I'll give you a chance to make up to me. I'm sure you'll like the idea.' He raises his hand and points it towards the edge of the bed. 'You, lying down over there, head towards the edge, and letting me use your throat... Doesn't it sound like something you'd enjoy?' Damien gives you the widest grin as his cock just keeps throbbing with the idea. Facing this, you are left with a decision before you commit to get your face utterly ravaged by the draconic devil.";
			LineBreak;
			say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Eagerly obey him and get facefucked.";
			say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Avert your gaze, excuse yourself and leave. Probably feign indisposition.";
			if player consents:
				say "     Wasting no time with any additional thoughts, you move to the bed and do as he said, lying down by the bottom of the bed with your head facing the edge. Damien is already up, watching you position yourself as he moves closer to you, placing both his muscular legs on each side of your skull. Above you comes that huge dong and balls covering your view, and past them, the devil's smirk and glaring eyes. Little time passes and he is already resting his meat atop your face, rubbing it across your cheek as you realize how large a foot-and-half-long cock truly feels. 'Fuck, I'm huge... Look at that, it's gonna make your neck bulge out!' he exclaims, dick pulsating with the anticipation.";
				say "     And then, Damien pulls back, the tip of his cock moving from under your chin to your lips as he leans his body forward, lining up his shaft directly towards your mouth. From there, he only has to push it down in order to have his dick enter you, making you wrap your lips around that meaty shaft as he buries himself into your throat. It is a little quicker than you would find comfortable, but there is this really sweet liquid that leaks out of his member that just seems to soften your sensitivity there, and you find yourself easily able to swallow all that cock without gagging, no matter how deep he goes. His thickness still, however, proves a challenge for your jaw, as you have to open wide to get all of it in.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     'Ooh... Feels fucking great! It's just what I needed, to fuck that cute face of yours...' he moans as he thrusts into your throat, pulling back only to thrust into it again and again, slowly and steadily at first, making sure you get accustomed to his cock. Noticing your quick adaptation, he picks up the pace, this time going harder and even deeper, and you begin to feel it traveling down your esophagus. That sensation only grows more intense as he adds an extra inch, then one more, and you only swallow the penis to the best of your abilities. Damien is happy, throbbing deep inside your throat, before he continues to pull himself up and dive back into it in a moderate, yet powerful rhythm.";
				say "     Your head hangs there, right at the edge of the bed and completely at the draconic devil's mercy, your mouth serving as a fuckhole of delight for him as he fucks your face in pure bliss, with part of that solid meaty shaft of his rubbing back and forth past your lips and tip pushing against your neck from inside, while his heavy balls swing above. At some point, he manages to get all of it - the foot-and-half-long tool - deep down your mouth, all the way to the base, and that is when he truly gets excited. 'You're taking the whole thing! Fuck...! That turns me on...' he comments, smiling at the fact, and wasting no time in going even harder. By now, his huge sack lays above your nose and forehead before it begins to smack it with each horny thrust Damien commits to.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Now, his pacing is fast, hard and relentless. 'Yeah, take it all like that... You're doing so good...' the devil exclaims, exhaling sighs of joy as he thoroughly facefucks you without holding up. His entire tool comes into play with no inch spared, going in and out of your mouth with no restraint whatsoever. Breathing for you becomes secondary as the pleasure of your friend becomes your priority, giving him all of you for him to feel satisfied. By the look on his face and his enthusiasm, you would say you are doing just fine being his fucktoy. He keeps this up for quite a long while, only making brief pauses so you can catch your breath, but soon dives back in with as much force as before.";
				say "     'That throat's fucking mine... And it's my favorite one... Fuuck...' The entire matress around you shifts and bounces back with the momentum of his thrusts, and your throat is so numb you cannot feel a thing, only the sensation of a big cock filling you up and stretching your neck's insides like one should in the current circumstances. Eventually, you feel a hand on the back of your skull, right under your head, as Damien decides to hold it in place, causing his pounding to be felt at an even greater intensity. It just feels like he cranked up the force by a ton, you are barely able to withstand the might of this draconic devil's lust as he threatens to completely destroy your throat.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     And then he goes at it even faster, in a mix of moving your head up and down and himself thrusting. His cock then, eventually, buries itself deep in your throat as its throbbing intensifies, Damien holding you against his pelvis as he releases a prolonged moan. 'Fuuuuck, I'm cumming down your throat!' His warning comes just as he shoots the first thick spurt of cum that is immediately sent into your stomach, then another, and you can swear they get more abundant each passing time. You can only hold your breath and swallow as much as you can of that sweet demonic seed. 'Down to the very last one, bud... Yeaaah...!' It is only once the last few drops arrive that he decides to let go of you, letting precious air free to travel into your lungs.";
				say "     'I really fucking needed this! And you did great... So great that...' he says as he crouches down next to you, bringing his face closer to yours before continuing. And, instead of words, he reaches for your mouth and kisses you, but not just like anyone ordinarily would. He presses his tongue past your lips, a very long, slick and pointy one, and completely assaults your mouth with a twirling motion that catches you completely by surprise. Once he is satisfied, he pulls away with a grin. 'There, for a job well done. You turn me on so much that I wanna kiss you... Wouldn't it be great if you kept coming back for more? I'm sure you'd like to keep fooling around with a sexy demon like me.'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     With a wink, Damien stands up straight and orders you to leave. 'Go on, now. I've got clients to take.' In the meantime, you have caught your breath and feel better to get up from the bed and head towards the door, saying your goodbyes to your friend. It seems you really left him in a good mood, as he replies back with a smile. 'Come back later, alright? I wanna own you completely, someday...'";
				say "     Once you are outside and close the door to Damien's room, Toron is quick to show up. 'Here, helps digestion,' he says as he hands you some sort of candy. You then realize you were left with a bloated belly, thanks to all the cum you chugged down. Seeing no harm in Toron's recommendation, you take the candy to your mouth... and are met with a minty and fresh taste, which... Dissolves rapidly in your mouth and completely overwhelms you. Your eyes widen as you struggle to breathe without chills running down your spine, but it passes quickly enough, and your belly returns to normal. 'Sorry that it feels so unpleasant, but its effectiveness is undeniable. Come, let us return to the bar.'";
				say "     You are then escorted back to the lounge. This encounter left you especially, and oddly, satisfied...";

			else:
				say "     You immediately excuse yourself to Damien as you tell him you are not feeling so good, then head towards the door. 'Oh, uh, yeah... Come back later, then? I guess?' he tells you, the last words you hear before you leave the room. Oh, wait, no, there is something else that you can still hear from past the door. 'Fucking hell, what got into [ObjectPro]? I'm gonna have to take care of this, it's fucking killing me! Maybe I should-...'";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     Whatever Damien was about to say is interrupted by Toron's sudden arrival. 'I see you are in a pristine condition. Took you no time, either. Though, you seem distressed? What happened?' You tell Toron that you had to refuse Damien's order, and eventually, you find yourself telling him every detail. You are not really... sure why you did that. The bartender simply nods. 'I understand. Do not worry, though, Damien was also given the demonic ability to eliminate gag reflexes. I am sure if you would partake in his suggestion, you would be fine. But perhaps you should return another time, lest you want to have to explain yourself to him once he realizes you feigned an indisposition.' Oh, you really cannot get anything past Toron, he sees right through you.";

He remains in the same position, except part of his robe has slide over his thigh and... revealed this huge draconic dong already throbbing at full attention, together with the plump crimson sack laying down underneath. Obviously, your attention is drawn to all that manhood immediately. 'Don't mind me, was just mindlessly stroking myself thinking of what to do to you if you entered through that door... And I think I know what.' He then gets up from the bed and walks towards you, his fiery gaze looming over you as he takes each step with a grin on his face. Once he is within reach, he places his hand below your chin and makes you look directly into his eyes.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     All forms of thought that were going in your mind vanish at that moment. It almost feels like a relief to not have to think about anything... Only the one demon man in front of you. 'There, better that way. I like when you're submissive and obedient... But you're going to appreciate being relaxed for this one.' His hand then goes directly for your butt, fingers grasping around one of your asscheeks as he practically slaps and grabs it, before he leads you over to the bed. Without any resistance, you follow his instructions and get on all fours atop the sheets. Your ass is soon exposed before the draconic devil as he smiles at the view, his cock throbbing with anticipation. 'Oh yeah... I really wanna fuck you today.'";
			say "     Words aside, he pulls your asscheeks apart and dives into them with his face, tongue ready to open you up. It is a long, slick one and nimble like a snake, pushing into your hole and delightfully wiggling inside, sending you pure pleasure as he expertly licks and moves his tongue inside you";
			if player is male:

				say ", his full focus remaining on your ass.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     By now, your back entrance seems to feel relaxed enough, and somehow feels like you could take a full-sized dragon cock ballsdeep with confidence. Damien happens to have something similar dandling between his legs at full attention, eager to drill you deep as per your mind's compulsive desire. Suddenly, you feel his weight on top of you, putting his arm around your neck and embracing you from behind, then slamming you down onto the bed's sheets, the impact making the entire mattress bounce in retribution. You can feel the draconic devil's cock pulsating in lust, as its shaft remains tucked between your buttcheeks, while Damien has his fun squeezing you a bit under him. Having you properly manhandled, he gives the side of your face a domineering lick before he whispers into your ear 'I own you now, don't I?'";
			say "     Moving his hips back, he aligns his cock with your butthole, rubbing the tip against it as hot precum begins to coat it. Your anus flares with desire the second you feel Damien poking at it with his tool, and you find yourself instinctively arching your back and moving your ass towards it, but the young man really has a tight grip on your body's movements, denying you any accomplishment. Though, you can hear him chuckle as he sees you desperately trying to get him inside you. 'I'll take that as a [']yes[']... worth more than any word, really. Alright, then maybe I should...' he says before beginning to push his cock into you, causing you to flinch as that thick and hard piece of flesh pushes your anal ring open, '... Do just that.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     From that point on, Damien only goes further inside you, burying his cock into you inch after inch while keeping you immobilized under him, with no other choice but to take more and more of his erection inside you as far as he decides. His grip on you is tight to almost the point of pain, denying you any movement other than helpless squirming, but feels way more exciting now. Somehow, the whole thing fits inside you and only results in pure pleasure, all augmented by the feeling of utter powerlessness. 'Ooh... Fuck yeah! You're one tight little cutie, aren't you? Let's see if you'll be able to walk away on your own when I'm finished with you...' Damien's words once more flow into your ear and mind as your lust for him only becomes greater.";
			say "     At last, he seems satisfied with the degree of your craving and proceeds to pull his cock back, only to thrust into you powerfully once, then twice, and relentlessly so for the next several more times. There is nearly no build-up, only aggressive fucking starting from the fourth or fifth move, pounding you like a beast in heat, around eighteen inches of thick draconic cock entering you and beating your insides out in ways you would not believe humanly possible to endure, but for some reason made so easy and pleasurable. Since this demon magic aids you through Damien's relentless and rough treatment, all you feel is the sheer bliss and joy resulting from the presence of his manhood in your sensitive areas.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The young demonic man seems to be enjoying himself as well, grunting as he destroys your ass with every thrust, sometimes taking a second to kiss you in the mouth as he continues to squeeze your body all over, his cock throbbing even more inside you. You think it kind of hurts, but it hurts really good and makes you moan, your mind telling you that you should let him do anything he likes to you, including smothering you under him and keeping you forever. At this point, you only feel the swollen base of his cock ramming into your hole, his balls also swinging back and forth against your [if player is female]feminine bits[else]taint[end if], as he picks up the pace with ever growing intensity.";
			say "     'You feel so good...! Should keep you as my little fucktoy... Yours is the best ass I've ever had!' Damien says, grunting forward as he, too, gives in to all the pleasure, enjoying himself as he drills your back hole with seemingly endless energy. You do not think he ever took a second to stop, nor a single break, as he continues to fuck you for the rest of your session with him. There comes a time when he finally slows down, but only to alternate between that and his previous rhythm, grunting and moaning as his edging point seems to draw close. Your mind is, by now, reduced to a sea of ecstasy as all you care right now is the sex, Damien's pleasure and how well you are serving him.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Though, even demons reach their limits, and Damien is no different. Once he feels that he cannot hold back any longer, he buries himself deep in you, all the way and past the swollen base, effectively locking himself inside you. 'Fuuuuck this one's gonna be big-... Yeah!' he shouts as the cum leaves him, an abundant load that threatens to overfill you with each spurt. The force of the hot demon seed being shot into you makes itself quite evident in your body, and even you fall into a state of orgasm, [if player is male]cumming right after him[else]quivering and squirming in pleasure[end if] from the sheer satisfaction alone, with overbearing happiness that you have managed to do well for the draconic demon.";
			say "     'Ooh... you did so good... Fuck, we gotta do this more often...' He then lies down next to you, not quite smothering you any longer, and takes you in for an embrace as he kisses you, waiting for his cock to recede. 'You're gonna keep coming to me, aren't you? Because there's so much more we can do together...' You cannot say no, and in fact, all you want to do is say yes and beg him to keep you, but your certainty slowly dissipates, leaving a feeling of slight confusion in its place. You still know what you have done, but it all feels a bit foggy in your memory. 'Alright, time for you to go, as I have some clients to attend to next. Thanks for passing by and getting my load, I'll think of you when I breed my next paying bitch.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     He lets go of you, helps you up and lets you walk to the door on your own, still with a hazy mind. This was particularly intense, you cannot help but think, and few seconds after you close the door behind you, Toron shows up. 'My, he did a number on you today. You are still leaking,' he declares, pointing to the floor as these drops of demon cum reach the floor, and they are coming from your ass. 'Get yourself presentable and then we shall head back to the Lounge.' Toron says nothing more until you are ready to return.";
			say "     And so, you are escorted back up. There is something in your mind, though, something that brings you back to that room with Damien...";
