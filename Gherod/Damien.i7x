Choosing to ignore such provocations, you try to explain how you happened to come across the sound of what seemed like a bear trap and chose to investigate, to only fall into a trap yourself. 'So, you hear a strange noise and head directly to its source without, I don't know... Scouting from a distance first? Sending a decoy? Testing your grounds before you set foot any further?'

He is trying to defend himself against the wilderness, and by wilderness, you really mean the unhinged roamers who would not hesitate trying to turn you, and anyone, into another one of them. 'Demons are a special case, though. Naturally, they're not of this world, but somehow, their presence and the infection intertwined, making them as dangerous as any other creature out there, if not worse.'";

I'm disappointed you couldn't see past the promises of good fun,' he replies, making a pause as he sighs once again, 'I take it you met their Demon Lord, as well. He's quite selective with his clientele... If you can call yourself that, even.' Indeed, the way you crossed paths with the hellfire demons was... Interesting, to say the least.

You two walk around the corner to find yourselves in another [bold type]Dark Alley[roman type], and the man leads you over to a specific trashcan. 'Can't say I'm doing all too good, but I've been surviving however I can. I figured I could do some good by hunting down troublemakers, starting with those demons,' he reveals, and just then, you become certain of the goal of his traps. 'They're not merely defensive, no. I'm trying to capture them, one by one. Eventually, the Red Light District will be a little safer for us all.'";

With such a cryptic reply, you even have doubts if you want to ask more about that, but of course, you still argue that they are a little bit too many for just one man to be doing this, and end up asking why does it matter so much to him. He does not even have a safe place to sleep, so why not worry about his own safety first? 'I've got a camping tent I place down whenever I need to catch a sleep, that's no problem for me. I know how to take good care of myself, and besides, staying around for too long in one place is a risk. I can't let them catch me too. As to why it matters so much to me... It's only a matter of justice.' There surely must be a story behind all this, but you figure you should not pry too deep into it. Perhaps once he trusts you more, you will know his true motives. For now, all you can do is offer him help, in any way you can.";

Well, one would need to be good to read facial expressions to understand whether someone is lying or not, but not for this guy. You clearly know he is lying, because he is one really terrible liar. '... Fine, I won't stop you if you want to stay or... Find me again, whatever. For now, you'll be able to find me around here at night, just look around for this sign,' he says, pointing at a scribbled symbol over the trashcan.";

It is best to keep on his good side before you decide how to proceed with him. You tell him you will not do anything to anger him, hopefully, though you cannot help but sympathize. 'Right... As for introductions... My name's Damien. I guess... Nice to meet you.' You introduce yourself as well, and let him know you are looking forward to get to know him better. 'I-...

Met a guy named Iker after that, and we've been roaming the place together ever since... Until the demons took him to their side.' His voice lowers in tone, a hint of anger surfacing as he explains this, but before he elaborates it any further, he closes up the subject. 'Now, I'm on my own. Just gotta accept that and move on.

You tell him you are happy to hear he is doing much better, but also figure you should ask about the matters with Iker, his former friend. 'Iker made his choice, and that's on him. Knowing he wasn't coerced into doing anything he didn't want to puts me at ease, and that's all I need to move forward.

I don't know where you've been, or what you've been doing. Most importantly, with whom. And no, I'm not telling you anything about my sex life.

'I know what you want to know, no need to beat around the bush.' You only nod, letting him know that he is right, that you quite frankly would want a bit of clarification on that.

Maybe I was being a little excessive. Nothing wrong with having a good time, and you showed me that. I...

Some people here seem to dig it, and truly... I've been needing a good haircut that didn't involve just cutting edges and strings of hair with a dull knife. A shave was also in order, for good measure, and... Yeah, I gotta say I feel much better after doing that.' You cannot argue that him taking care of himself is definitely better than letting the elements decide how he looks, so congratulations are in order.

		say "     You ask Damien if he would like you to accompany him in some scavenging around the district. Maybe on the way, you can assist the young man by being on the lookout for demons and other hostile roamers, and it is always a sort of bonding activity for the both of you. 'I suppose that's a good way to spend time. Here was I wondering if you'd rather be having tea together,' he responds, ending with a clear tone of sarcasm before he chuckles and begins to walk ahead of you. At least, he does not seem too disinclined to have you around, and for you, having such a resourceful partner will definitely make scavenging a lot easier and effective. Before you go, however, Damien stops by one of the garbage containers and takes what seems to be some additional equipment from inside. 'You never know when we need to shoot something on the way,' he says, as he shows you several more bolts for his crossbow.";
		say "     Daring not to question him nor his choices for stashing his valuables, you wait until he is done. 'There, that should be everything. I hope you can hold yourself. You better.' Observation made, he beckons you to follow him as you both begin to walk. It does cause you to think whether this man just so happens to be really good at this whole survival thing, or if he is simply immensely paranoid. Nonetheless, no one would probably think of looking into trash containers for valuables, so maybe he has the right idea after all. 'I know what you're thinking. Crazy idiot hiding stuff under garbage, bla-bla... Well, I used to have a base for myself. An abandoned warehouse of sorts. Wasn't particularly safe, though, so I had to find ways to stash my supplies in places nobody would look. Call me paranoid, I guess, but I've been around for long enough to know better.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     His attitude does not really come to much of a surprise, even more knowing very well of the dangers of the city and its surroundings. Perhaps there were enough experiences for Damien to have learned better, and this is his way of dealing with the current times. You cannot judge him for being too careful, as there is no such thing when almost nowhere is safe. 'As for the rest, I simply set a perimeter of traps to ensure nothing comes close. They're nothing too elaborate, I'm sure anyone with half a brain can figure it out. They aren't meant to trigger on anyone who still has some part of their brains intact. Guess there can always be exceptions...' It also takes some cleverness to set up traps like that, so you ask him where he learned to do that. 'Nowhere in specific, I guess being an engineer helps figure out shit like that.'";
		say "     It would make sense, someone used to figure out contraptions or devices would perhaps find it easier to come up with clever ways to put junk and scrap together. 'As for where or how I learned to do all that... I guess it was out of necessity. When you gotta survive and protect yourself, you sorta have this instinct of learning and improving yourself. And ever since...' he pauses there, hesitating to continue for a moment, but eventually lets out a sigh and carries on speaking, 'I've had an issue with the demons before, as you could probably tell. I wasn't on this alone, but they... Changed that. Took him to their side.' You tell him you do not mean to pry, but it does feel like it was an important person for him. 'He was my friend in the middle of an apocalypse. That's already something invaluable by default, if we're not taking into account this is actually a person I cared about. Anyway... Yeah, they deserve to pay for that.'";
		say "     'But let's focus on the task at hand, shall we? I've had enough of sharing my sad life.' While you are conversing, you exit the alley and head into less visited areas, in hopes to find something useful for both of you. Though as you pass through Crimson Street, the man's attention turns towards the Hellfire Club... After a long moment of silence, he turns around and continues walking down the street with you. 'We used to visit the club, it was a nice way to let out some steam, even though I always had a feeling they were up to no good... But the demons there were so nice and welcoming, made us feel comfortable in there... It seems to have been all but a scheme to catch us off guard and get a hold of our souls. They almost fully succeeded...'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'I immediately feared betrayal the day my friend simply disappeared. He was nowhere to be found, didn't return to our shelter, didn't leave any messages... Nothing. I then went back to the club and asked [bold type]Mogdraz[roman type] directly, and the fucker didn't even try to hide it. He said it to my face that they took his soul and welcomed him into their ranks, by his request...! Yeah, by his request my ass. How the fuck would he...' His voice begins to show more and more anger as he goes on, but gets a hold of himself before it happens. 'They fucking tricked him. They must have put something on his drink, or cast some demonic sorcery on him, I don't fucking know.' The reason to why he hates demons seems clear enough. His friend gave away his soul to the Hellfires, and Damien understands he has been tricked into doing that.";
		say "     'Let's just keep moving. I don't want to linger here.' You then agree to head deeper into the street, about to move into some alleys between a bunch of residential buildings. Damien keeps talking, but lowering his voice as you both walk on ahead. 'I want my message to be clear to them. No one fucks with me, and especially with those I love and care for. Anyway... Sorry for the rant, I guess. I underestimated how fucking miserable it feels to not have anyone to talk to for so long.' These are his final words on the subject before you turn your attention to the urban landscape in front of you. It is nothing impressive, really, just several shattered ground floor windows and the generic desolate street. You are not quite familiar with this area of the district, but you can tell it probably has also been completely ransacked.";
		LineBreak;

Additionally, after hearing the voices for a while longer, [bold type]you are very convinced that you know them[roman type]. Damien lowers his voice to a whisper as he beckons you to keep it down as well. 'They don't know we're here, so we can turn this around. Follow me.' Not wanting to go against his judgment, you do as he says, for now.";
		say "     Once you have got yourselves a good hiding position, the voices come closer, to the point you can actually hear what they are saying. If you still had any doubts, you can definitely tell this is Arad and Egran's voices, though mostly Arad speaking, 'Would I ever fucking know that there'd be one of those walking dick fuckers in there? I wouldn't! It's not my fault they managed to group up and splatter our supplies full of their stupid jizz!' Egran retorts, visibly annoyed, 'You damn fucking knew it, don't play innocent. And thanks to your carelessness, we gotta hunt at least two dozens of them down before we report.' Arad persists in this argument and attempts to excuse himself, 'Look, yeah they're nosy, but I thought, hey it's just a few crates! Nobody's gonna care! I wasn't told there was a herb in there that fucking lured them! I blame the imp courier fucker!'";

Then, you see him loading his crossbow, and you realize things might actually get rough, as he is literally preparing a deadly weapon. You rush to stop him and ask him to reconsider, arguing that killing them is extremely excessive. 'Killing them? Who... I'm not killing anyone, you crazy shit.' You blink, then look down at his crossbow, then back to him with a clearly inquisitive expression. 'These aren't meant to kill, they're tranquilizers. Although I...' he pauses, and you feel a hint of anxiety creeping in as you fear what he is going to say next, '... I haven't tried any on them. Guess we'll find out what it does.' It seems like your scavenge run has turned into a demon hunt and you cannot really do anything to detain him...";

You figured that worked out, at least.";

Once he realizes who the two of you are, he stops and exclaims, 'It's you?!' The young man at your side keeps his crossbow aimed at Aran as he speaks, 'You try anything else and you're gonna get it too, Arad.' If you had any suspicions before, this confirms that Damien knows these two as well. 'Damien! Hey! That's... Not the friendliest way to start a conversation!' You can see Arad is... Slightly nervous, to say the least, as he holds his unconscious brother. The demon continues, clearly confused with the current situation, 'What's gotten into you?! I thought we were friends!'";

What nonsense is that?! The guy gave his soul willingly! Mogdraz surely must have told you!' The young man's expression goes from angry to angrier after hearing that, and raises his voice, 'Willingly?! Are you so fucking sure about that?! I know what your whole shtick is! Tricking people into feeling like that's the best move of their lives, giving away their souls to the almighty Hellfires for an eternity of... Whatever it is you offer.' Arad is then quick to reply as he places his hands down on his hips, 'What the fuck do you mean?! You seriously hit your head on something really hard.'";

Sure, they could encourage you to do something like that, but they are definitely not the kind to force that upon you. Perhaps Damien misjudges them, or you are indeed missing something. Regardless, all you can do is listen and advise from what you know about them. 'I guess if Iker wasn't coerced into giving away his soul, he did it willingly. And maybe...

Looking closely, you conclude it must be an extension of what really makes the Red Light District, though it seems to have been an older area that will most certainly be forgotten once this is all over... If it ever will. 'Well, there's one that doesn't look too bad over there.

Could've been closed off before it all began...' He then looks at the lock, then at the window, and finally at his crossbow... But stops himself there. 'Breaking the window could be risky, and I don't wanna step on anyone's toes if this happens to be a hideout. I can pick the lock instead.' Well, that is certainly a useful skill to have.

Once your entry is finally unimpeded, you two enter the mysterious shop, and the first thing you notice is an odd, faint lingering scent of incense. 'Looks abandoned, but smells funny,' he comments, and as you look around, you see the store is mostly empty and, frankly, quite uninteresting. You cannot even tell what kind of shop this used to be, and it might not even be a shop at all, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions. 'There ain't much going on in here, is it?

Maybe you could check that out? Seems like some back storage of some kind.' You look in the direction he is pointing at, and there is a door left ajar. Perhaps you could find something in there indeed, so you tell him you shall search that room. He sheds some light onto the area, which helps you immensely once you open the door and have a look inside. Unfortunately, there is not much in here besides some bags with empty boxes and the occasional odd trinket. 'Huh... Trinkets? Maybe a small souvenir shop, or something esoteric...

You're really good with your mouth, you knew that?' he says, chuckling in the end, though you do tell him he did not really give you a chance to reply before he made you drink his cum.

The reason for this is that we discovered it had certain effects on local citizens, namely... Transformative effects. We actually never concluded it could fully turn someone into a kind of hellfire demon, and given your enthusiasm with your... friend, and how much he loved that drink, we allowed you to continue this investigation for us.

We intervened and offered Iker a deal. He was to continue to encourage Damien to have that drink and indulge his fantasies, and we would make sure he got well-rewarded. The arrangement did not last for too long and Damien would soon find out that Iker was trying to do something to him, thought of him corrupted and left with a grudge on us, understandably so.

Toron was given permission to recommend and serve the drink you have been encouraging Damien to have, and you have not shown any opposition towards it, so we continued to observe your interactions and effects.

As you begin to realize the true reason of this meeting, you ask Mogdraz if, by any chance, that meant he sort of sold you to this new Damien. 'Sold you?! No, [if Resolution of MogdrazRomance >= 8][italic type]I'd never do that to you! What sort of individual would I be if I betrayed your trust in such a way? I'd have never forgiven myself[roman type][else]it is not like that[end if]... What I did was to merely agree that you could visit him for free and he would have no limits in what he could do with you during said meetings. You are not bound to him, in any way. In fact, you could ignore him for the rest of your days. He did not say more than this, so I've concluded those were his only terms.'";

You may [bold type]now request to be with him[roman type] whenever you wish to, but you must be [bold type]wary of his acquired power[roman type] due to the deal he made with Lord Mogdraz. We have an idea of what he intends to do with you in the long term, and it might not be wise for you to pursue any further relationship with him. Surely he will help the Club profit, so, of course, we benefit from this arrangement. You, on the other hand, if you continue to meet with him, [bold type]we will not be able to protect you from any effects he might have on you[roman type], due to the terms of his deal with Lord Mogdraz. This is why we have decided to inform you of everything that is relevant to the situation.'";

This surprised you, even knowing Damien was already changed almost beyond recognition due to the transformative drinks, but hearing such a different tone coming from him is definitely a shock, one that you were not quite prepared to face. You place your hand over the door's knob and rotate it to the side, then slowly push it open, looking over the floor as you take a step forward. Without opening the door completely, as if subconsciously shielding yourself, you only peek inside to have a look at the dragonmorph. You had already seen him, but now... He is truly a demon.";
	say "     'Don't be shy! It's me! We're still friends, right?' he asks you, with an enthusiasm too unnatural, too unsettling, as you look at him from head to feet. He is lying down on the bed with one of his elbows on the sheets, holding his own head up with his whole body fully turned towards you, giving you a complete view of his physique. He truly is changed, even when comparing to the last time you saw him. Damien is now even taller, even stronger, with a pair of horns which size could compete even with Mogdraz's. You can sense the heat coming from his crimson scales from where you are standing, and his fiery eyes give you quite the trouble, as they draw yours into his in an almost compelling manner. You avert exchanging gazes, for now, because of how that makes you feel. It is like letting your mind open for him to pry into, a feeling that leaves you extremely uncomfortable.";

He grins as you approach him, a smirk that tells mischief from miles away, but you do not think it is his intention to hide his thoughts on you. Even now, Damien is a quite attractive devil, and you know he could get anything he wanted from you if he tried hard enough. Perhaps you already knew of this, but only now you are truly exposed to the fact. With only silence between you and his upsetting gaze, you figured you should at least ask how he had been doing during these past times, and tell him that you already know about his deal with the Demon Lord, which is why you are here.";

I just thought you'd appreciate the fact I thought about you before trading my soul for some more of this... form. I mean, this is pretty rad!' As Damien speaks, you find yourself slowly letting your guard down near him, as he does not seem to be mad at you, at least until now. 'I admit, I felt quite betrayed when I realized you were conspiring with Toron to turn me into this fucking sexy dragon devil, but... Fuck, I love this! I can fuck for hours! Days! I just don't get tired of it! Shit, being human sucks in comparison. I can even fly! And fuck while flying! Think you could do that as a human?!

Shit, I can't believe I forgot I was the one who ended up corrupting him with my advances... Mogdraz said I had developed this sort of will bending thing in my eyes during my transformation, and I might have made Iker believe he was into me without really knowing I was influencing his mind. Turns out I was, and then he sold his soul for an eternity of servitude in some random-ass place full of big manly demon dudes. What a fucking buttslut he became... It's kinda funny, right? A straight dude turned into a mindless bottom slut craving for dick all the time... Imagine having the power to do that!'";

Would Toron let you in here if you didn't know of the terms I chose?' he replies, a little perplexed, and you tell him that you, indeed, know of those terms, but they have not told you the full thing, which you would like to hear from him. He sighs, but still decides to answer, 'Yeah... So... Since I was struggling with my mind, I asked Mogdraz to stabilize it. He said he'd do it, in exchange for my soul, and convinced me that, otherwise, my soul was already lost, because I'd be struggling my whole life to resist depravity.'";

Then, I wanted immortality, of course, which he said it was already included in the demon status. He also told me of what kind of work he could offer me and I picked escorting, since it's just fucking all the time, so an easy and fun job. I made sure he allowed you to come see me for free, at any time you wanted, but that those stupid rules of his wouldn't apply in our meetings. He agreed to all those terms, so I signed the contract and it was done! Next thing I know I'm an even bigger, badass draconic demon, and I was so fucking horny I ended up starting an orgy in the dungeons with a bunch of guys and gals. I was on fucking fire that night!

'You know, you still owe me for what you've done. Even if I didn't exactly mind my fate, you still betrayed my trust by doing it on my back.

But you can come as close as I allow it.' You then ask him what he meant by owing him something, and that makes him laugh, for moments. 'There are plenty of ways to make it up to me that don't involve sucking my dick, you know... But I'll forgive you. I suppose you can't really help yourself when you see someone this hot right in front of you, right? And that's why I'll let you look at me. Make sure you memorize every inch of me...'";

Like this, you get a good look at his cock as he continues to stroke it, still with steady and slow movements, only feeling up his thick and slick shaft. At this rate, it will take him a long time to finish, but perhaps, that is his intention. 'It's true that you've blown me many times, already... but believe me, it'll not feel the same... You'll find it much harder to stop when you realize how good it tastes, how warm it feels... And wait until you get some precum to leak out of it... And until you're swallowing my load... It's true what they say about demon cum... It's addictive. You can't help yourself but keep craving for more...'";

This is not orc cum we're talking about, no... It's lust. Desire... Passion, at times... which can be as binding as a simple chemical addiction.' A drop of his precum begins to ooze at that moment, causing your eyes to widen as your gaze sprinkles with a pleading look, something you are unable to control. 'Yeah, it's pretty thick, too... Look at this...' he says, drawing your attention to his fingers as he picks up the drop between his clawed thumb and index, then showing you how consistent and long the strand of liquid is by slowly moving them apart and back together numerous times.";

At one point, he smears it all over the tip of his index finger and you can definitely tell how much of that is contained in just the few first drops. He enjoys seeing you looking at him from where you are kneeling, begging for a taste of his juice with your eyes. You are not quite sure why you are craving for it so much, but there is something in the air around you, a warmth that evaporates any irrelevant thoughts and leaves only those that matter... to the dragonmorph, at least. Every inch of him, his sculptural body, his size and might, the way he looks at you and draws you in with such little effort... Everything overwhelms you the more you lose yourself in him.";
	say "     You find yourself looking into his eyes more times than you should, causing your mind to become a haze of lustful thoughts, all the more reinforced by the way he goes on stroking himself showing genuine pleasure from the current situation. His foot is still keeping you at a distance, as you continue to feel it pushing against your chest. Damien only grins at your helplessness, knowing the effect he is having on you, but keeps only jerking, a little faster now. In a way, you can also sense his excitement, the power he holds over you feeling intoxicating for him, as if there was a slight empathic link between the two of you. This unbearable desire that takes over you has you moving your hands over your privates to also stimulate yourself, and Damien does not stop you.";

Damien then brings the hand that he was stroking with to touch yours and slowly pulls it back, allowing you to touch his slick member, whichs gives out a welcoming throb the moment your fingers meet the meat. You are not allowed to touch him anywhere else, nor with anything else other than only this one hand, but you want to jerk him off so bad that you begin to do just that. He smiles in approval and lets you. 'Go on, and don't stop...'";

Committing to the cause, you move your hand up and down through his big shaft in a rhythm you know Damien will find pleasant, and kind of just know when to do it quicker, followed by how deep and fast he breathes and the moaning he lets out. 'Come in a little closer, bud...' he says, whispering, touching the back of your skull to show you what he means. You do so, leaning your head over to mere inches of distance from his dick as you continue to stroke him. His scent is really strong in here, almost causing you to feel lightheaded, but incredibly horny.";

You know you should not stop now, under any circumstances, and carry on until his edging point... 'Keep going... I'm almost there...' he warns you, his dick throbbing in anticipation. Its tip is aimed towards your face, and that is exactly what you want as you keep on jerking him off, rubbing along his entire shaft until the point of no return is hit...";
	say "     It is then that Damien squirms a little, moaning as his load begins to travel through his manhood only to be shot directly onto your face, a very generous spray of cum that goes on and on until your entire face is covered in it, dripping down to your body and causing your own [if Player is male]cock to burst in joy[else]climax to surge through you[end if] so intensely... The draconic devil's orgasm goes on for a long time until it subsides, and you earn yourself something similar to a cum bath. He laughs once he sees the state he left you in. 'Fuck... That's a lot of cum... Bet that feels really good on you, doesn't it?' Damien looks at you with a smirk on his face watching you covered in his own jizz. You take a tentative taste on a drop that falls by your lips, and it immediately tempts you to get more.";

In fact, you think he might even enjoy watching you walk away covered in it, as if marked by him. You are given no other choice but to start walking towards the exit as you say goodbye to him. 'Oh, it won't be long, I'm sure...' he replies as the door closes on you, leaving you outside.";

It's just what I needed, to fuck that cute face of yours...' he moans as he thrusts into your throat, pulling back only to thrust into it again and again, slowly and steadily at first, making sure you get accustomed to his cock. Noticing your quick adaptation, he picks up the pace, this time going harder and even deeper, and you begin to feel it traveling down your esophagus. That sensation only grows more intense as he adds an extra inch, then one more, and you only swallow the penis to the best of your abilities. Damien is happy, throbbing deep inside your throat, before he continues to pull himself up and dive back into it in a moderate, yet powerful rhythm.";
				say "     Your head hangs there, right at the edge of the bed and completely at the draconic devil's mercy, your mouth serving as a fuckhole of delight for him as he fucks your face in pure bliss, with part of that solid meaty shaft of his rubbing back and forth past your lips and tip pushing against your neck from inside, while his heavy balls swing above. At some point, he manages to get all of it - the foot-and-half-long tool - deep down your mouth, all the way to the base, and that is when he truly gets excited. 'You're taking the whole thing! Fuck...! That turns me on...' he comments, smiling at the fact, and wasting no time in going even harder. By now, his huge sack lays above your nose and forehead before it begins to smack it with each horny thrust Damien commits to.";

				say "     Now, his pacing is fast, hard and relentless. 'Yeah, take it all like that... You're doing so good...' the devil exclaims, exhaling sighs of joy as he thoroughly facefucks you without holding up. His entire tool comes into play with no inch spared, going in and out of your mouth with no restraint whatsoever. Breathing for you becomes secondary as the pleasure of your friend becomes your priority, giving him all of you for him to feel satisfied. By the look on his face and his enthusiasm, you would say you are doing just fine being his fucktoy. He keeps this up for quite a long while, only making brief pauses so you can catch your breath, but soon dives back in with as much force as before.";
				say "     'That throat's fucking mine... And it's my favorite one... Fuuck...' The entire matress around you shifts and bounces back with the momentum of his thrusts, and your throat is so numb you cannot feel a thing, only the sensation of a big cock filling you up and stretching your neck's insides like one should in the current circumstances. Eventually, you feel a hand on the back of your skull, right under your head, as Damien decides to hold it in place, causing his pounding to be felt at an even greater intensity. It just feels like he cranked up the force by a ton, you are barely able to withstand the might of this draconic devil's lust as he threatens to completely destroy your throat.";

				say "     And then he goes at it even faster, in a mix of moving your head up and down and himself thrusting. His cock then, eventually, buries itself deep in your throat as its throbbing intensifies, Damien holding you against his pelvis as he releases a prolonged moan. 'Fuuuuck, I'm cumming down your throat!' His warning comes just as he shoots the first thick spurt of cum that is immediately sent into your stomach, then another, and you can swear they get more abundant each passing time. You can only hold your breath and swallow as much as you can of that sweet demonic seed. 'Down to the very last one, bud... Yeaaah...!' It is only once the last few drops arrive that he decides to let go of you, letting precious air free to travel into your lungs.";
				say "     'I really fucking needed this! And you did great... So great that...' he says as he crouches down next to you, bringing his face closer to yours before continuing. And, instead of words, he reaches for your mouth and kisses you, but not just like anyone ordinarily would. He presses his tongue past your lips, a very long, slick and pointy one, and completely assaults your mouth with a twirling motion that catches you completely by surprise. Once he is satisfied, he pulls away with a grin. 'There, for a job well done. You turn me on so much that I wanna kiss you... Wouldn't it be great if you kept coming back for more? I'm sure you'd like to keep fooling around with a sexy demon like me.'";

In the meantime, you have caught your breath and feel better to get up from the bed and head towards the door, saying your goodbyes to your friend. It seems you really left him in a good mood, as he replies back with a smile. 'Come back later, alright? I wanna own you completely, someday...'";

You then realize you were left with a bloated belly, thanks to all the cum you chugged down. Seeing no harm in Toron's recommendation, you take the candy to your mouth... and are met with a minty and fresh taste, which... Dissolves rapidly in your mouth and completely overwhelms you. Your eyes widen as you struggle to breathe without chills running down your spine, but it passes quickly enough, and your belly returns to normal.

Obviously, your attention is drawn to all that manhood immediately. 'Don't mind me, was just mindlessly stroking myself thinking of what to do to you if you entered through that door... And I think I know what.' He then gets up from the bed and walks towards you, his fiery gaze looming over you as he takes each step with a grin on his face.

His hand then goes directly for your butt, fingers grasping around one of your asscheeks as he practically slaps and grabs it, before he leads you over to the bed. Without any resistance, you follow his instructions and get on all fours atop the sheets. Your ass is soon exposed before the draconic devil as he smiles at the view, his cock throbbing with anticipation. 'Oh yeah... I really wanna fuck you today.'";

Suddenly, you feel his weight on top of you, putting his arm around your neck and embracing you from behind, then slamming you down onto the bed's sheets, the impact making the entire mattress bounce in retribution. You can feel the draconic devil's cock pulsating in lust, as its shaft remains tucked between your buttcheeks, while Damien has his fun squeezing you a bit under him. Having you properly manhandled, he gives the side of your face a domineering lick before he whispers into your ear 'I own you now, don't I?'";

Your anus flares with desire the second you feel Damien poking at it with his tool, and you find yourself instinctively arching your back and moving your ass towards it, but the young man really has a tight grip on your body's movements, denying you any accomplishment. Though, you can hear him chuckle as he sees you desperately trying to get him inside you. 'I'll take that as a [']yes[']... worth more than any word, really.

Somehow, the whole thing fits inside you and only results in pure pleasure, all augmented by the feeling of utter powerlessness. 'Ooh... Fuck yeah! You're one tight little cutie, aren't you? Let's see if you'll be able to walk away on your own when I'm finished with you...' Damien's words once more flow into your ear and mind as your lust for him only becomes greater.";

There is nearly no build-up, only aggressive fucking starting from the fourth or fifth move, pounding you like a beast in heat, around eighteen inches of thick draconic cock entering you and beating your insides out in ways you would not believe humanly possible to endure, but for some reason made so easy and pleasurable. Since this demon magic aids you through Damien's relentless and rough treatment, all you feel is the sheer bliss and joy resulting from the presence of his manhood in your sensitive areas.";

You do not think he ever took a second to stop, nor a single break, as he continues to fuck you for the rest of your session with him. There comes a time when he finally slows down, but only to alternate between that and his previous rhythm, grunting and moaning as his edging point seems to draw close. Your mind is, by now, reduced to a sea of ecstasy as all you care right now is the sex, Damien's pleasure and how well you are serving him.";

Yeah!' he shouts as the cum leaves him, an abundant load that threatens to overfill you with each spurt.

I'm not done with you yet, however...' he continues as he firmly grabs you by the neck, lifts your head and slips his tongue into your ears before whispering, 'Got something else I wanna do to you before you leave...' After that, Damien drags you over to the floor, making you, without any resistance, get up from the bed and kneel before him.

While you do feel his meat bumping against your lips repeatedly, Damien does not seem to want you to suck it. He takes in the view for a while, appreciating the fact you are utterly trapped between the wall and him, with a big grin on his face. 'Seems I haven't marked you yet, so how about we take care of that before I send you on your way?' He then takes only a single, small step backwards and, with one hand, he takes hold of his shaft and aims its tip towards your face...";

He does not seem to care either if it makes a mess or not, only that you are thoroughly coated in his liquid waste from head to feet. 'Been keeping this for a while just for you... See how thoughtful I am?' he teases, throwing in a chuckle in the end. A big demon like him undoubtedly can keep a lot of that stuff in, and this really is no different, as this golden shower you are in keeps going for little more than a full minute. A puddle of it has formed around you as his pee runs down your body, having effectivelly drenched you.";

'Damn, I really fucking covered you in it... That's hot... So you better get out before I get horny again, yeah? Let everyone know you're mine while you're at it.' As the demon beckons you to get up and gestures at the door, your focus begins to slowly return to you, and it takes you a while to process what just happened.

You'll be required to shower, I am not going to deal with this today. Territory marking like the canines do, now? Here was I thinking we were dealing with a proper demon... Get moving after me, will you? I'm escorting you to the nearest bathroom right away.' And with his words he follows, taking you somewhere you can clean yourself before returning to the world outside.

Because there's so much more we can do together...' You cannot say no, and in fact, all you want to do is say yes and beg him to keep you, but your certainty slowly dissipates, leaving a feeling of slight confusion in its place. You still know what you have done, but it all feels a bit foggy in your memory. 'Alright, time for you to go, as I have some clients to attend to next. Thanks for passing by and getting my load, I'll think of you when I breed my next paying bitch.'";

'Get yourself presentable and then we shall head back to the Lounge.' Toron says nothing more until you are ready to return.";

'There, I think you should appreciate being relieved of the ability to think for yourself... Just let me take over.' He then pulls you in to deliver a long lick across your face with that long demonic tongue of his, with a rather unnatural movement of twisting and sliding. 'I have a rather unusual itch today that you may be able to help me with. I don't do this often with anyone, but with you I feel... Confident enough. Would you be so kind to strip down for me and lie down on that bed, face up?' He gives your cheek a stroke as he makes his request, which your brain processes as an order. You should not question him, nor do you want to. Obeying him feels fantastic.";
			say "     So much, in fact, that you do not hesitate, already anticipating his words of praise as you move towards his bed, following his directions. As such, you proceed to ensure your body is as naked as it can get and lie down across his bed, face up, and wait for him. 'It pleases me seeing that you do what I tell you without thinking twice about it. That's the sort of devotion I like. Now... as for that itch I mentioned...! Not an usual thing for me, but hey, I practically own you, so why do I have to find a justification to give you? Or anyone, for that matter? I'll just make use of you, right? I'm sure you agree with me on that.' Of course you do, as you nod affirmatively, no questions whatsoever lingering in your mind.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Damien is quick to approach you at this point, and soon, he climbs on top of you. His statuesque body is enough to keep you pinned down below him without any hope of getting away, but it is not like you wanted to, either way. However, he does love to show off his power over you, reminding you of your place... 'Good view from up here, and I bet yours isn't bad either... Now, enjoy it while it lasts...' he says, his grin widening as he must be thinking about what he is going to do to you. The devil ensures you are comfortable enough with his best pillow under your head, then swiftly repositions himself, now having you face his whole back and rear. He lifts his tail just above your head as he glances at you over his shoulder, having slightly raised his muscular butt as your eyes wander in marvel.";
			say "     'You better take a deep breath, as air is gonna be, um... Scarce, yeah?' Almost as soon as you hear that, he brings his ass above your head and fits your face in between those huge bubble asscheeks, and immediately you realize what he meant. It is impossible to breathe as his butt practically hugs your face, even more so as he grinds it against you, wiggling it around so that every space in there is filled with your face instead. Your head sinks into the pillow with his weight, becoming trapped between it and Damien's ass. 'Oh, that feels amazing...! You know, sometimes I need something up my ass... Mind you, not a cock or anything like that, I'm yet to find someone who would earn that privilege, but sitting on a face is such a wonderful feeling... By the way, where's that tongue? I'm only letting you breathe once I feel it deep in my hole!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You most definitely do not want to let your friend down, do you? So, it becomes very clear what you must do, and that is to obey him! Anything to feel that sweet tingle in your brain, that satisfaction of doing the right thing, and that is so true whenever you please this one devil. Without any further ado, you push your tongue against his soft and tight hole, which feels surprisingly receptive to your touch. It is not much trouble to wiggle it deeper inside, and Damien reacts to it with a pleased moan. 'Yeaah, that's it! You love being such a good [boygirl] for me, don't you?' He then keeps his promise and lifts his butt just enough for you to be able to catch your breath, but soon after you are done taking some air in, he comes back down to ride your face in a quite enthusiastic manner.";
			say "     'Hope you've got the time to be my seat... My schedule's pretty free this time, so I could just have you lick my ass until I blow my load. If you lick it good enough, I won't even have to touch myself...' Your mind processes this as a challenge, and as such, it demands your very best efforts at achieving success. With that thought process, you put double on licking his ass and shoving as much as you can of your slick organ in that devilish hole. It feels warm, tight, soft and even tasty, pulsating around your tongue with its slightly moist walls that makes licking them feel oddly pleasing. Your focus on Damien's pleasure is so great that you even forget about your normal bodily functions, only remembering the fact you need to breathe when he allows you to do so.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Your hands raise towards his back and buttcheeks as you feel it once more overtaking your face, all that size and muscle hugging it to an almost unbearably hot point, but with everything else about it, how he absolutely overpowers you and has hold of you in such a kinky way, you can only thoroughly enjoy it and retribute with lots and lots of licking. The sheer size of the demonic man is something to be reckoned with, as it clearly translates into enough strength to hold you down, and all you have to do is to keep licking his hole in respect, as much as you can, as deep as you can and keeping it as interesting as you are able to with wiggling and creative twirling. 'Oh, best seat ever...! How about we get you into this as a full-time job? I'd rather sit on your face than anything else in this world...!'";
			say "     With Damien getting more and more excited, his ass also bounces more and more against your face, almost as if jumping up and down slightly, each time pressing down hard on you. He alternates this movement with grinding and lifting when you have to take your breath, but your tongue never leaves his hole in any circumstance. The movements you make with it actually manage to drive him mad with lust, his satisfaction further encouraging you to give it your all. 'Fuck, I gotta jerk off to this, my cock's gonna fucking explode...!' he exclaims as he proceeds to do what he just announced, and as he does so, his hole's walls seem to clench around your tongue way harder than before. 'Don't you stop now... I'm close...!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     And you do not, to the point your tongue even begins to feel numb from the ordeal of never-ending wiggling. Soon, you feel Damien's whole rear entrance quivering as he releases an ecstatic shout, and with it, his load that gets shot all over your body from the chest below. The amount of his hot, demonic seed does not disappoint, either, as the handsome devil ensures he absolutely drenches you in it. 'Fuck! Fucking best seat ever! I think I already said that, but wow... You're such a good little slut! Seems like you enjoyed yourself down there too, eh? If you want more, all you gotta do is say... This is one of those things I never tire of.' He pats you on the top of your head as he gets up, an almost too cold whiff of fresh air shaking up your face, which is covered in sweat.";
			say "     'Alright, your face is starting to look comfortable again really quick, so I'd suggest you to get going before I make you become my permanent ass pillow... Not that I'd mind that, but it'd make working for the great almighty Mogdraz a bit awkward. Though, if I were to be free one day... Hm, something to think about, isn't it? I wonder if [italic type]anyone[roman type] could find a way for that to happen...' he finishes with a wink, and just as you hear his order, you get up from his bed and gather your things quickly. As per his words. Damien throws himself onto the bed as he watches you go, and then, you hear a snap of fingers as you open the door, your senses now slowly returning to you as you find yourself outside his room.";

It is a particular scent, one that some may even consider... arousing. Not in general, however, so I suggest you wash it before returning to the world out there, lest you want to hear nasty words about its nature and the fact it comes from your face... Just a - hm - friendly advice.' In fact, you can quite feel the smell of Damien's ass in your nostrils, the thought of it alone causing blood to rush down your loins, so you decide to follow Toron's hint and pass by the restroom to wash it. It does not do that much regarding the ingrained scent, but at least others are not able to tell you have been made an ass pillow for who knows how long by the sexiest of devils...";
