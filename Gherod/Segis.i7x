to say ResolveEvent Strange Android Seeker:
	if Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 0:
		say "     Amidst your walk around the District, you make a detour to an alley you have not been to, before, in hopes of finding something different. With the state of this city, there is barely anything left worth checking, but you would try anything you can if there is a chance your time and effort is rewarded. Unfortunately, this is another disappointment: what used to be a small grocery store is now nothing but its empty walls and rubble. If there is any food left here, it is most likely spoiled or expired. Nevertheless, you try to find something. Even a water bottle would be a good haul, at this point. So, you crouch down near a toppled shelf and see if you can find anything you could bring with you.";
		say "     But then, you begin to hear a moan. It startles you, at first, but nowadays it is such a common noise that you do not think too much about it. It seems to come from far, anyway, so you should be good... Until it then becomes a call for [']help['], which is slightly more worrying. It is the voice of a man, and it seems to be fading away, as if they were getting weaker. As it seems you cannot even scavenge without a disturbing sound interrupting you, perhaps it would be better to seek out the source of such voice, lest there is an imminent threat that could catch you by surprise and you would never see it coming. Of course, a normal person would worry about a cry like that, too, but you know better than to believe you can help anyone without putting yourself in danger along the way.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Slowly, you bypass the grocery store and try to think where the sound could have come from. As it stopped, this task became more difficult, though not impossible, as you think you did not hear it too far from your relative position. Perhaps in one of these other alleys, as Red Light is full of them. You check one, then another, and another... And before you start thinking about letting it slide, turn tail and leave, you do find a dark shape of someone lying on the floor, with their back against the wall. You approach them carefully, and they do not seem to be making any coherent sound, only moaning low. The voice seems familiar, like the same man you just heard a while ago, but you could be wrong. Nevertheless, this looks suspicious, to say the least.";
		say "     Upon closer inspection, you notice the man has a quite extravagant coat and smells of a perfume that makes your groin tingle. Shaking it off, you try to make sense of what you see. This man is knocked out, fast asleep, drooling from the corner of his mouth, with his cock out and throbbing hard without it even being touched. You wait a minute as your eyes take some time to process this, and suddenly, the man just cums spontaneously before you, though an already weakened orgasm, with a still considerable amount of cum, yet not as hard as one would expect. It just sort of oozes out of his cock, which keeps standing rock solid and without signs of giving up so quickly. There are no visible hints of struggle or anything strange other than his clearly drug-induced state, which might explain things.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     There is nothing you can do to help the poor man, who looks more like one of those twisted pimps you see roaming the streets, so perhaps, you should really not help him. But it does leave you wondering who could have done this, if there is someone to blame for it...";
		now Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 1;
	else if Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 1:
		say "     Whether by coincidence or a subconscious thought of some sort, you find yourself walking past that same grocery store from the other day, near where you found the drugged man fast asleep with a persistent erection. This reminded you of such happening, and you begin to consider if you should pursue this matter any further or just forget about it... Is there really someone assaulting people in Red Light District, drugging and leaving them in a state of catatonic lust? What if they sneaked upon you and you suffered the same fate?";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]What are you going to do?[roman type][line break]";

		if player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     You think you might have a chance in discovering something if you tried to look for more clues and begin to consider what areas you should head to. Perhaps there is something to be found in another one of these alleys, or you could linger for long enough to hear or watch a similar event take place. Whoever has been doing this will eventually do it again, probably. With that in mind, you tread gingerly along the streets, hoping to make your time and persistence worth it. Nothing seems to be happening in the near vicinity, so you move to another area, setting your path towards a different direction and, again, trying to be discrete. This particular spot does not seem to have a lot of movement, which could be a good place, but that also means anyone could hear you coming if you are too noisy.";
			say "     And so, you wait around for a while, always on the move, keeping your eyes and ears in maximum alert. Currently, you are passing through another alley with a few small entries into the back sections of the buildings, like small street backyards where there are trashcans and graffiti painted walls. As you continue to walk, you notice a few blue bubbly drops on the floor, which melt into a sticky mess if you squish them under your foot. You hear only a breeze blowing a little harder on your face as you look around, an eerie silence following afterwards and nothing else, but you do happen to spot a few more jiggly blue beads. A closer look reveals a kind of a trail leading to one of the backyards, to a door.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     It does not take a lot to conclude that the door has been forced open. While the door itself does not seem to have been damaged, the lock has been rendered useless, possibly picked and destroyed in the process. You can easily push it open, albeit it creaks a little and does not slide smoothly enough, which explains why the wind did not do it by itself during all this time. The place is dark, without a single window, and you struggle to see, but you hear someone mumbling deeper ahead. You sort of have to be feeling the walls around you and walk really carefully to not accidentally bump into anything you should not, but the sound grows louder as you proceed. The voice is masculine, but all you hear is gibberish, sounding more like he is not even moving his lips.";
			say "     As you take a turn, your eyes glance over a dim glow, which helps you see. It seems like you have been stepping on old newspapers and trash scattered all over the place, but more importantly, there is plenty of gel-like substances along the path. The nature of who you see next explains this, as it is, in fact, a blue gel person, knocked out and talking to himself words that you cannot understand. He is not exactly blue, though. Right now, he has a slight tone of green and is mysteriously glowing. As you take in his entire shape, you notice the same things as before: a throbbing hard cock, constantly oozing liquid, and if you wait... he cums spontaneously, with weak drops only slowly managing to climb out of his shaft.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     No doubt this is another victim of the same assaulter, with the exact same things having happened, except this one clearly struggled. You try to talk to the blue gel, hoping he would say something that could help you identify the suspect, but he only mumbles more gibberish. You think that you may have heard the words [']stop['] and [']like['], among faint sounds similar to [']cold['] and [']too hard[']. The poor gel guy is so spent that he can barely mutter anything else before he shuts down completely, sleeping in absolute silence and without motion. That certainly did not help much, at all! You have only learned that this is a relentless pursuer who does not give up so easily and is quite resourceful. Doors will not stop them, and they seem to be quite brawny. A [bold type]direct conflict might not be the best idea[roman type] against them...";
			say "     There is nothing else you can do, here, other than observing a sleeping blue gel man cumming a few more times during his sleep. Surely, you have more interesting things to do, and this place is not exactly safe to linger. Carefully, you make your way out of here and back to the alley, then swiftly move towards one of the streets and begin to head to more familiar areas within the Red Light District.";
			now Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 2;
		else:
			LineBreak;
			say "     You do not think you should hold any more thoughts about this, as there are other things you must turn your focus to. Regardless of what is happening here, you need to consider your priorities.";
	else if Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 2:
		say "     With the matter of the unknown assaulter in Red Light District still pending, you occasionally find yourself looking back and glancing over your shoulder. This is starting to affect you, keeping you more on guard and deviating your attention from things you could be doing better. This is not just a roaming creature you can either fight your way out or lose your dignity to, but someone who knows what they are doing and with only one goal in mind that you have yet to determine. While you have only seen males victims, you cannot yet conclude that [if player is not male and player is female]you would be safe[else]females would be safe[end if] from this perverted assaulter, who seems to know a great deal about how to get in places, fight and incapacitate someone. Definitely, it is no ordinary creature.";
		say "     You could resume this investigation, but say... What if you actually find and fail to stop them? What could happen to you if you were to be another victim of this assaulter? And will you have wasted your only chance at capturing them, to stop this madness once and for all? But more importantly... Can you do it, if it comes to that? From the information you have gathered so far, this is a strong and intelligent individual.";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]Do you wish to proceed any further with your investigation? You better make sure that you are prepared for an eventual conflict, and you might need to use your aptitudes. [roman type][line break]";
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Resume your investigation.";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Drop it, for now.";
		if player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     Having decided to continue, you take a deep breath and return to the area that you think this suspect roams more, hoping to find them in a position in which you can finally see something conclusive. It might not be an easy task, so you double check your equipment and utilities in case you have to use them. Noticing that everything seems to be in place, you are now ready to actively search for this assaulter or any more victims they may have made. This area extends towards the Crimson Street, from behind it, amidst residential blocks of humble characteristics, severely vandalized by now. You struggle to navigate this place somewhat due to how similar everything looks, but marking a few checkpoints does the trick.";
			say "     Places without a lot of movement is what this pursuer seems to prefer, which signifies the area where you should be. Nevertheless, there may be a chance you will not find anything, so before you get your hopes up, you should consider failure to find anything else as a possible outcome and procure other paths that could be relevant. You do, eventually, make some backup plans and plan your route accordingly, leading yourself through several more alleys that should follow similar patterns as before. Tracing the assaulter's profile in your head, you know better where to look and think like them. It even makes you feel like a proper detective! But you are pretty sure this is just survival instincts doing the work.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Your luck seems to be changing, however. Not too far from here, you hear a voice. Unsurprisingly, it is male, but a rather deep, inhuman one. Bringing out memory on what sort of creatures and people like to roam this district, you conclude that this could be a demon. Well, demons are severely stronger, which means this one might pose a problem to the assaulter, and it may even be considered biting more than they can chew, but if they actually manage to overpower one... It could mean bad news. You immediately follow the source of this voice, past a single street and turning to your right into another alley, a broad one but equally quiet, if it were not for the swearing words you are hearing.";
			say "     Something must have really pissed off this demon, but his enraged tone dulls out and fades, progressively turning into just helpless moans. This is bad, so you hurry up and walk a little faster, which is not easy as you are still trying to keep silent. Carefully, you make sure you are placing your feet in empty ground, without accidentally kicking any empty cans, bottles or easily shattered objects, lest you wanted to announce your presence loud and clearly. Eventually, you manage to acquire sight of what is happening, and you almost cannot believe it...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     In front of you lies down a huge, horned and red guy, so, a hellfire demon, completely naked and with a raging boner. Holding it is a single person that you from behind perceive as a white-colored anthropomorphic dragon, crouched down in front of the devil and stroking his cock in a very methodic way. It does not look like they are indulging a perversion or enjoying what they are doing, but rather feels like it is a chore for them, forcing a handjob on a demon the same way someone holds a broom to mop up the floor. But what seems really strange is the unnatural gleaming this dragon person has about their scales, as if they were not actually a living being, but more of a... thing.";
			say "     You stick by a spot you think is safe and observe what is happening. The handjob continues eventlessly, with monotonous motions until the demon cums a great deal. With this, the dragonmorph had a sort of flask ready to collect the devil's semen, and it seems they knew how much they would be carrying, as they have selected an especially large one. Once the demon lets out his final drops, the assaulter puts the flask back in the bag they carry with them and proceed to stand up, leaving the hellspawn there in the same lustful stupor as the others were, mumbling nonsensical words as he is barely able to speak. Once this dragon individual turns around, your eyes land directly on theirs, a pair of unnaturaly glowing cyan orbs that flicker as they perceive you. Uh oh...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The positive side of this is, you have found out who the suspect is, but there is also a problem... They did not like to be discovered. You leg it immediately, running at maximum speed through the streets to attempt to outrun this assaulter, but they stay on your tail well enough that they do not lose you. You were right, they are indeed a relentless pursuer, and you must find a way to evade them quickly! Taking turns around several alleys, you try to lose sight of them. You think you have managed to do it as you see them slowly walking by the same alley you have entered, and you are temporarily holding an advantage...";
			LineBreak;
			say "     You think you were quite fortunate that you could slip through this spot without them noticing, but they will not give up so easily. There is only one way out of this, and that is by incapacitating them, first. There are several options you could attempt...";

When it moves, you can hear its mechanical joints behind you, reminding you of its artificial nature.
