[Next, they find a hallucinating blue gel, with a strange colored tone. Concludes he was were drugged as well, and he mumbles about a robot of some kind. The drug still has him hard, oozing and cumming in periodic intervals]
[Finally, the player finds this odd speaking dragon with a mechanical tone, looking pretty much like a dragonmorph except for the eyes and some other details that give him away. He's currently collecting a sample from a Hellfire Demon, who sleeps soundly and also drugged.]
[ Player can choose to interfere, which results in a fight against the android.]
[ If lost, the android will also attempt to collect a sample from players with a cock. Females will be ignored.]
[ if won, the android will break. You can choose to get rid of it by destroying or stashing it in a safe place.]

[ - Things the player can do with the broken android body comes in a future update - ]

to say ResolveEvent Strange Android Seeker:
	if Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 0:
		say "     Amidst your walk around the District, you make a detour to an alley you have not been to, before, in hopes of finding something different. With the state of this city, there is barely anything left worth checking, but you would try anything you can if there is a chance your time and effort is rewarded. Unfortunately, this is another disappointment: what used to be a small grocery store is now nothing but its empty walls and rubble. If there is any food left here, it is most likely spoiled or expired. Nevertheless, you try to find something. Even a water bottle would be a good haul, at this point. So, you crouch down near a toppled shelf and see if you can find anything you could bring with you.";
		say "     But then, you begin to hear a moan. It startles you, at first, but nowadays it is such a common noise that you do not think too much about it. It seems to come from far, anyway, so you should be good... Until it then becomes a call for [']help['], which is slightly more worrying. It is the voice of a man, and it seems to be fading away, as if they were getting weaker. As it seems you cannot even scavenge without a disturbing sound interrupting you, perhaps it would be better to seek out the source of such voice, lest there is an imminent threat that could catch you by surprise and you would never see it coming. Of course, a normal person would worry about a cry like that, too, but you know better than to believe you can help anyone without putting yourself in danger along the way.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Slowly, you bypass the grocery store and try to think where the sound could have come from. As it stopped, this task became more difficult, though not impossible, as you think you did not hear it too far from your relative position. Perhaps in one of these other alleys, as Red Light is full of them. You check one, then another, and another... And before you start thinking about letting it slide, turn tail and leave, you do find a dark shape of someone lying on the floor, with their back against the wall. You approach them carefully, and they do not seem to be making any coherent sound, only moaning low. The voice seems familiar, like the same man you just heard a while ago, but you could be wrong. Nevertheless, this looks suspicious, to say the least.";
		say "     Upon closer inspection, you notice the man has a quite extravagant coat and smells of a perfume that makes your groin tingle. Shaking it off, you try to make sense of what you see. This man is knocked out, fast asleep, drooling from the corner of his mouth, with his cock out and throbbing hard without it even being touched. You wait a minute as your eyes take some time to process this, and suddenly, the man just cums spontaneously before you, though an already weakened orgasm, with a still considerable amount of cum, yet not as hard as one would expect. It just sort of oozes out of his cock, which keeps standing rock solid and without signs of giving up so quickly. There are no visible hints of struggle or anything strange other than his clearly drug-induced state, which might explain things.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     There is nothing you can do to help the poor man, who looks more like one of those twisted pimps you see roaming the streets, so perhaps, you should really not help him. But it does leave you wondering who could have done this, if there is someone to blame for it...";
		now Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 1;
	else if Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 1:
		say "     Whether by coincidence or a subconscious thought of some sort, you find yourself walking past that same grocery store from the other day, near where you found the drugged man fast asleep with a persistent erection. This reminded you of such happening, and you begin to consider if you should pursue this matter any further or just forget about it... Is there really someone assaulting people in Red Light District, drugging and leaving them in a state of catatonic lust? What if they sneaked upon you and you suffered the same fate?";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]What are you going to do?[roman type][line break]";
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Investigate.";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Drop it, for now.";
		if Player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     You think you might have a chance in discovering something if you tried to look for more clues and begin to consider what areas you should head to. Perhaps there is something to be found in another one of these alleys, or you could linger for long enough to hear or watch a similar event take place. Whoever has been doing this will eventually do it again, probably. With that in mind, you tread gingerly along the streets, hoping to make your time and persistence worth it. Nothing seems to be happening in the near vicinity, so you move to another area, setting your path towards a different direction and, again, trying to be discrete. This particular spot does not seem to have a lot of movement, which could be a good place, but that also means anyone could hear you coming if you are too noisy.";
			say "     And so, you wait around for a while, always on the move, keeping your eyes and ears in maximum alert. Currently, you are passing through another alley with a few small entries into the back sections of the buildings, like small street backyards where there are trashcans and graffiti painted walls. As you continue to walk, you notice a few blue bubbly drops on the floor, which melt into a sticky mess if you squish them under your foot. You hear only a breeze blowing a little harder on your face as you look around, an eerie silence following afterwards and nothing else, but you do happen to spot a few more jiggly blue beads. A closer look reveals a kind of a trail leading to one of the backyards, to a door.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     It does not take a lot to conclude that the door has been forced open. While the door itself does not seem to have been damaged, the lock has been rendered useless, possibly picked and destroyed in the process. You can easily push it open, albeit it creaks a little and does not slide smoothly enough, which explains why the wind did not do it by itself during all this time. The place is dark, without a single window, and you struggle to see, but you hear someone mumbling deeper ahead. You sort of have to be feeling the walls around you and walk really carefully to not accidentally bump into anything you should not, but the sound grows louder as you proceed. The voice is masculine, but all you hear is gibberish, sounding more like he is not even moving his lips.";
			say "     As you take a turn, your eyes glance over a dim glow, which helps you see. It seems like you have been stepping on old newspapers and trash scattered all over the place, but more importantly, there is plenty of gel-like substances along the path. The nature of who you see next explains this, as it is, in fact, a blue gel person, knocked out and talking to himself words that you cannot understand. He is not exactly blue, though. Right now, he has a slight tone of green and is mysteriously glowing. As you take in his entire shape, you notice the same things as before: a throbbing hard cock, constantly oozing liquid, and if you wait... he cums spontaneously, with weak drops only slowly managing to climb out of his shaft.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     No doubt this is another victim of the same assaulter, with the exact same things having happened, except this one clearly struggled. You try to talk to the blue gel, hoping he would say something that could help you identify the suspect, but he only mumbles more gibberish. You think that you may have heard the words [']stop['] and [']like['], among faint sounds similar to [']cold['] and [']too hard[']. The poor gel guy is so spent that he can barely mutter anything else before he shuts down completely, sleeping in absolute silence and without motion. That certainly did not help much, at all! You have only learned that this is a relentless pursuer who does not give up so easily and is quite resourceful. Doors will not stop them, and they seem to be quite brawny. A [bold type]direct conflict might not be the best idea[roman type] against them...";
			say "     There is nothing else you can do, here, other than observing a sleeping blue gel man cumming a few more times during his sleep. Surely, you have more interesting things to do, and this place is not exactly safe to linger. Carefully, you make your way out of here and back to the alley, then swiftly move towards one of the streets and begin to head to more familiar areas within the Red Light District.";
			now Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 2;
		else:
			LineBreak;
			say "     You do not think you should hold any more thoughts about this, as there are other things you must turn your focus to. Regardless of what is happening here, you need to consider your priorities.";
	else if Resolution of Strange Android Seeker is 2:
		say "     With the matter of the unknown assaulter in Red Light District still pending, you occasionally find yourself looking back and glancing over your shoulder. This is starting to affect you, keeping you more on guard and deviating your attention from things you could be doing better. This is not just a roaming creature you can either fight your way out or lose your dignity to, but someone who knows what they are doing and with only one goal in mind that you have yet to determine. While you have only seen males victims, you cannot yet conclude that [if Player is not male and Player is female]you would be safe[else]females would be safe[end if] from this perverted assaulter, who seems to know a great deal about how to get in places, fight and incapacitate someone. Definitely, it is no ordinary creature.";
		say "     You could resume this investigation, but say... What if you actually find and fail to stop them? What could happen to you if you were to be another victim of this assaulter? And will you have wasted your only chance at capturing them, to stop this madness once and for all? But more importantly... Can you do it, if it comes to that? From the information you have gathered so far, this is a strong and intelligent individual.";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]Do you wish to proceed any further with your investigation? You better make sure that you are prepared for an eventual conflict, and you might need to use your aptitudes. [roman type][line break]";
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Resume your investigation.";

		if Player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     Having decided to continue, you take a deep breath and return to the area that you think this suspect roams more, hoping to find them in a position in which you can finally see something conclusive. It might not be an easy task, so you double check your equipment and utilities in case you have to use them. Noticing that everything seems to be in place, you are now ready to actively search for this assaulter or any more victims they may have made. This area extends towards the Crimson Street, from behind it, amidst residential blocks of humble characteristics, severely vandalized by now. You struggle to navigate this place somewhat due to how similar everything looks, but marking a few checkpoints does the trick.";
			say "     Places without a lot of movement is what this pursuer seems to prefer, which signifies the area where you should be. Nevertheless, there may be a chance you will not find anything, so before you get your hopes up, you should consider failure to find anything else as a possible outcome and procure other paths that could be relevant. You do, eventually, make some backup plans and plan your route accordingly, leading yourself through several more alleys that should follow similar patterns as before. Tracing the assaulter's profile in your head, you know better where to look and think like them. It even makes you feel like a proper detective! But you are pretty sure this is just survival instincts doing the work.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Your luck seems to be changing, however. Not too far from here, you hear a voice. Unsurprisingly, it is male, but a rather deep, inhuman one. Bringing out memory on what sort of creatures and people like to roam this district, you conclude that this could be a demon. Well, demons are severely stronger, which means this one might pose a problem to the assaulter, and it may even be considered biting more than they can chew, but if they actually manage to overpower one... It could mean bad news. You immediately follow the source of this voice, past a single street and turning to your right into another alley, a broad one but equally quiet, if it were not for the swearing words you are hearing.";
			say "     Something must have really pissed off this demon, but his enraged tone dulls out and fades, progressively turning into just helpless moans. This is bad, so you hurry up and walk a little faster, which is not easy as you are still trying to keep silent. Carefully, you make sure you are placing your feet in empty ground, without accidentally kicking any empty cans, bottles or easily shattered objects, lest you wanted to announce your presence loud and clearly. Eventually, you manage to acquire sight of what is happening, and you almost cannot believe it...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     In front of you lies down a huge, horned and red guy, so, a hellfire demon, completely naked and with a raging boner. Holding it is a single person that you from behind perceive as a white-colored anthropomorphic dragon, crouched down in front of the devil and stroking his cock in a very methodic way. It does not look like they are indulging a perversion or enjoying what they are doing, but rather feels like it is a chore for them, forcing a handjob on a demon the same way someone holds a broom to mop up the floor. But what seems really strange is the unnatural gleaming this dragon person has about their scales, as if they were not actually a living being, but more of a... thing.";
			say "     You stick by a spot you think is safe and observe what is happening. The handjob continues eventlessly, with monotonous motions until the demon cums a great deal. With this, the dragonmorph had a sort of flask ready to collect the devil's semen, and it seems they knew how much they would be carrying, as they have selected an especially large one. Once the demon lets out his final drops, the assaulter puts the flask back in the bag they carry with them and proceed to stand up, leaving the hellspawn there in the same lustful stupor as the others were, mumbling nonsensical words as he is barely able to speak. Once this dragon individual turns around, your eyes land directly on theirs, a pair of unnaturaly glowing cyan orbs that flicker as they perceive you. Uh oh...";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The positive side of this is, you have found out who the suspect is, but there is also a problem... They did not like to be discovered. You leg it immediately, running at maximum speed through the streets to attempt to outrun this assaulter, but they stay on your tail well enough that they do not lose you. You were right, they are indeed a relentless pursuer, and you must find a way to evade them quickly! Taking turns around several alleys, you try to lose sight of them. You think you have managed to do it as you see them slowly walking by the same alley you have entered, and you are temporarily holding an advantage...";
			LineBreak;
			say "     You think you were quite fortunate that you could slip through this spot without them noticing, but they will not give up so easily. There is only one way out of this, and that is by incapacitating them, first. There are several options you could attempt...";

When he moves, you can hear his mechanical joints behind you, reminding you of his artificial nature.

It is quite pleasurable for you, and the more you caress it with your lips and tongue, the moister it seems to become on its own. His dick even comes with natural lubrication, which has an oddly sweet taste to it, and it seems to come in more abundance the more you suck on it.

When you eventually pull back, a large glob of artificial precum oozes out of the dragon android's cock, a sight that is actually arousing. However, you do tell him that you do not actually need that much, but it is good to keep a nice stream of it going. He laughs and cheerfully says, 'I'm honestly just really happy I can do that. The wetter the better, is what they usually say about blowjobs... But hey, if it tastes good, why not keep going?' He did not adjust it at all, and moreover, he actually pulls your head back to his cock without letting you speak any further words.

[Upgrades available:

PERSONALITY MODULES:
		These modify Segis' personality, affecting his dialogue in most sections.

- Himbo
		Segis will behave like your next door gym-addict guy with the kindness of a generous gentleman... and the horniness of a horned-up jock.
- ...


COSMETIC UPGRADES:

- Dick Size:
		9" (starting default)
		12"
		16"
- External Genitalia:
		Adds a way to bring Segis' sexual equipment outside, allowing for further customization.
- Cum Flavor:
		Humanly Salty (Ordinary flavor, default)
		Demonic Sweet (Like demon cum, it's sweet and lust-inducing)
		Orcish Spicy (Like orc cum, has alcoholic properties)
- Cum Quantity:
		Normal (default)
		Plentiful (bigger balls, requires External Genitalia)
		Messy (even bigger balls, requires External Genitalia, Plentiful and Muscular Frame)
- Lactation:
		No Lactation (default)
		Add Lactation (Segis chest will now produce milk in modest quantities, requiring suckling to be extracted)
		Extra Milky (Makes Segis produce generous amounts of milk through his expanded chest. Leaks are to be expected, however. Requires initial Lactation and Muscular Frame (or potentially boobs from a future female body modification?))
- Body Type
		Slim Frame (default)
		Muscular Frame (Increased muscle mass, unlocked by having Segis on 'Himbo' personality for a few days. Personalities can be switched around freely afterwards.)
			Note that this increases Segis' Weapon Damage at the cost of Dexterity by 2, respectively.


COMBAT UPGRADES:

- Powerful Blow:
		Augments Segis' swing force, allowing him to hit for more damage. +1 Weapon Damage
- Improved Powerful Blow:
		Augments Segis' swing force even further, dealing even more damage with each strike. Requires Powerful Blow. Mutually exclusive with Improved Aimed Strike. +2 Weapon Damage (total +3)
- Aimed Strike:
		Improves Segis' aim with his strikes, allowing him to hit more accurately. +1 Dexterity

SCAVENGING UPGRADES:
		All Scavenging protocols Segis can learn to assist you during his special Scavenge dialogue action.

Note that the player can acquire scrap materials all by themselves through an event in High Rise District, and can hunt for gel, cum and milk items from encounters.

- Scavenger Protocol:
		Unlocks the Scavenge action for Segis. This allows you to order Segis to scavenge, hopefully collecting supplies and scrap for upgrades.
		He'll return to the Maintenance Storeroom once he is finished.
		Segis will prioritize Junk Scrap for upgrades, always returning with some, and may sometimes find useful survival supplies. You can tell him to be selective and bring only food and water, otherwise he may bring dirty water and junk food on occasion.

- Metal Detection Augment:
		Improves Segis' metal detection sensors, allowing him to find the sturdier stuff, Metallic Plate.

- Repair Lust Serum Injector:
		Allows Segis to go on solo Hunting.
		This allows him to inject his stupor-inducing lust drug into creatures he finds in order to harvest things from them.
		He may recover several cum and milk items at random, as well as gel.

- Material Recycler:
		Provides Segis with a method to convert Metallic Plate into Junk Scrap and vice-versa, as well as converting gel into Silicone Paste for upgrades.

This area in particular used to be a reception hall, and the scratches on the walls and carpets, followed by several tufts of fur if you inspect closely, may be able to form a suggestion in your mind regarding what happened here. Further ahead there are doors to elevators, with the stairs to the side, but you easily conclude the latter were barely used. 'Power has been cut out from here. No way these elevators would work!'";
	say "     Even if the elevators were in working condition, you really have no idea where to head. As you express your doubts to Segis, the android forms an hypothesis in his processors, 'Why don't we take the stairs and head into the basement area? Because, let's think about this. Have you ever seen an android like me in the times before the nanite outbreak? Likely not! I was probably some sort of secret project. There is no way these sorts of things would take place in upper floors, correct? Our chances of finding something of relevance are higher if we head lower!' Well, this seems to be indeed a sound proposal, lest you wished to explore every floor above you, which would probably take you a long time for little reward.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With that said, you push the door to the stairs open and head downwards with your android companion close by. Naturally, this section only gets darker, but Segis seems to have an incorporated flashlight that comes out of his very eyes! 'Our optical units will not suffer any hindrances! I must add that this place seems to be oddly familiar. I have no definitive memory regarding this particular building, but I suspect a hidden process is reinforcing my behavior so that I confirm the correctness of my actions. We are in the right route!' With Segis['] help, you manage to mind your step and arrive at an inconspicuous hall. There, you find an iron door that seems to have an electronic lock, hiding just behind several debris, toppled furniture and other objects you cannot quite identify.";
	say "     Segis is strong enough to clear a path for you, but the lock remains a problem. 'This could take a while, but I believe I can override it. These sorts of locks remain tightly locked even without power, you usually need it only to open. But worry not, I may be able to harness some of my current power output into it and force this door open! Care to guard my back while I figure this out?' You do as he requests, keeping aware of any strange noise or sighting while Segis tries his very best at unlocking this door. The place, besides dark, is also ominously silent, though you doubt scavengers would bother with an office complex that only had computers, archives and boring rooms for corporate meetings. Still, it never hurts to be alert.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     He leans over the lock, turning his full attention to it as his hand turns into a tool kit for him to operate its electronic components. 'This seems like a particularly stubborn lock. Hold on a moment!' You then hear a zapping sound, followed by a spark, and your concern rises. 'Nothing to worry about! I need only a bit more time!' Now, you find yourself looking over your shoulder and towards Segis, more worried that he may cause some explosion than with the possibility of being harassed by scavengers. Then, a flash suddenly hits your eyes, not strong enough to dazzle you, but sudden enough to startle you. 'Short-circuit! I'm fine! I was built to endure these.' No, you are definitely more worried about him, so much that you completely forget all about keeping your guard up, considering vigilance less important than reassuring your android companion remains in good... integrity.";
	say "     'Aaah... I... Erh... Aha! Got it!' Another flash assails your eyes as a loud spark echoes through the silent room, prompting you both to leap backwards. Segis, who was standing right in front of you, just bumps into you as he steps back, causing you both to fall on the ground. A dragon android is now practically sitting on your lap while you assess the butt pain you have just acquired from falling the way you did. 'Oops! I was startled! That was not supposed to happen... But the door is open! Uh... Are you alright, [sir]? Do you need medical attention?' You assure the android that you are fine, but perhaps he should get up and allow you to stand on your feet. He is [italic type]way[roman type] heavier than he looks!";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'My apologies! I did not mean to topple you over! Here, let's get you up.' He extends a hand towards you to pull you up with little effort, though his robotic strength causes you to actually, accidentally, sort of hug him with the momentum. He takes this as a friendly gesture and hugs you back. 'Oh, why there is no need for such! I merely have done my duty! But I shall not deny a request for a hug!' You try telling him that was unintentional, but it does feel nice, in a way. Despite his cold metallic frame, Segis['] grip on your figure feels satisfying. After several seconds of accidentally hugging each other, he lets go and prompts you to look towards the now unlocked door. 'I believe our destination lies past this former obstacle!'";
	say "     With that out of the way, you are now free to explore this secret area. Your companion's illuminating eyes are most of all the light you need to be able to perceive your surroundings. 'I believe this is it. Nobody seems to be around, however. This place was left as it was, with the lock still in place. It is where I was created...' You ask him if he is certain of what he is saying, given that he had no previous memories of this place. 'I am receiving an update to my memory... ... ...' He goes silent and stops moving, completely frozen in place, and you begin to fear the worst. You take two careful steps back as your heart begins to race, ready to fight back if anything happens...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Suddenly, Segis turns towards you, the bright light in his eyes hitting you right in the face, dazzling you and prompting you to cover your eyes with your hand. 'There is no need for concern, [sir]! I have already marked you as an ally and protected said designation from intrusive programs. Nothing can turn me against you. However, I have realized my former purpose.' You slowly drop your guard once more and ask him what he means. 'This area seems to have backup power that is still running, surprisingly. It reached for me and uploaded all the missing information that I had prior to my untimely deactivation caused by you. However, the time we've spent together taught me to reconstruct my code structure and protect my identity. Thanks to you, I am no longer being used by these goons. You've freed me.'";
	say "     He is capable of reconstructing his own code? You know that Segis seemed smarter than an average robot, but a machine capable of writing their own behavior may mean they are more than, indeed, a simple robot. 'Come, we should be able to find logs on my development, if your curiosity lingers. If not, maybe information on what sort of equipment we could use to further upgrade myself.' Segis then leads you over to some terminals, which he just unlocked for you, and also finds you a temporary light source for you to be able to see in here.

I do not know why, I cannot understand how I was conceived the way I was, only to be thrown back to being a simple robot. I resisted in attempts to free myself...' It does not take much thought to conclude that something is, indeed, very wrong in this. There is no reference to Segis actually going on a rampage to forcingly collect samples from people in the street, nor being equipped with a potent lust-inducing drug.";
	say "     You inquire him on that, but Segis['] response is delayed. 'I don't know... I was hoping to find all the answers here, but I only have more questions. I fear I may have been stolen amidst my attempt of freeing myself. Someone had access to me and reprogrammed me into that, maybe... In either case, I hope you don't mind me being an actual... sentient synthetic being. I will do my best to present myself as a simple android! No need to worry about other people finding me unsettling or disturbing.'

Speaking of which, I may have found a method to install upgrades on myself. I've found a three-dimensional printer right here! It's quite sizable, however... I don't think we can move it. But! I may be able to repurpose my hardware. Perhaps a phallic structure with several positive reinforcement receptors would accurately simulate a masculine sexual organ, although I have found the right shape for my anthropomorphic dragon look.' That reminds you, there is also no reference to SEGIS being a dragon-shaped android, so you refer that. 'Ah... It is true. This body could have been assembled elsewhere? Or right here, and then I edited it? No... No, that does not seem right, hm... I have no idea!'";
	say "     Another question left unanswered. You begin to think this is not even the same SEGIS referred in the logs, as they share no similarities at all except for the fact they seem to be an AI. It almost feels like he was changed beyond recognition at a later point. Despite that, Segis seems to be committed to give himself a penis, so he messes with the printer's settings until he is satisfied. 'Alright, a few hours and I shall be equipped with a functioning cock! Hopefully. I have associated protocols I'll be glad to run once the process is finally complete. Would you like a shoulder rub while we wait?' He then pulls a nearby wheeled chair and taps on it, beckoning you to take a seat.";

Every pressure point is pressed and relieved masterfully, so much that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation surging through you. 'You feel quite soft. Is this how it feels to be made of flesh?' he asks, his voice sounded more like a lullaby than anything due to how good this is making you feel.

Care to touch it, [sir]? I must ensure its receptors are working fine if it is someone else performing the stimulation.' Seeing as this was the whole point of your expedition, you nod to him, and place your hand around the slick metallic organ, then give it a couple of rubs. Segis looks at you, tilts his head and says, 'Oh. I... It feels great? There is no other way to describe it. Am I simulating it well?' Judging by how the entire shaft pulsates with your touch and Segis['] description of the sensations you are providing him with, you let him know that it seems accurate enough.";
	say "     'I find this to be quite pleasurable... Do you mind continuing? Uh, but perhaps later! I don't... trust this place.'

This robot seems to be able to change parts of its hands and fingers to call devices with a magnitude of different utilities right from inside its scales, and once it lays its eyes on you, they flicker in an unnatural glowing cyan light. With the fluid and swift movement of a humanoid, the android approaches you with the intent of taking you down, no sound nor voice coming out of its solid frame.";
