But you sense a presence coming towards you, by the approaching sounds of heavy footsteps only augmented by the otherwise surrounding silence. In an instinct, you backtrack towards the building and keep your card in hand, just in case you need a place to ensure your safety. Now, you glance around and towards the source of such sounds, and eventually spot a relatively large figure walking in your direction. At first, they do not seem to have noticed you, however that is soon proven false. This bulky shape looks dangerous for its size, and a closer look reveals something worrying... It is a transformed person, a male anthropomorphic horned bovine who, when he spots you, shows a not so happy expression.";

He seems to be carrying a rather large backpack, as well. 'Hey! What the hell are you doing in there?! Where did you get a card?!' he shouts, which... is not the worst thing it could happen. No sex-crazed insane creature would ask you such a thing in that tone or expression, and he is not charging at you with suggestive intent, but he looks pissed. Right after he asks this, he really picks up the pace and starts walking towards you very fast... Well, he is still not charging at you, but you are going to be in trouble if you do not explain yourself... This guy is big.";

'Did you really think I would believe that?! You've got the card in your hand, and you just came from the building! I saw you opening the door and walking outside!' he angrily yells, with a really intimidatingly deep voice that feels capable of shaking your soul. 'Have you touched the console? Have you done anything that machine asked of you?!' You cannot really lie, here. As soon as he enters the facility, he will be able to tell that you have interacted with the console, so your only option is to admit that you have messed with it.

'That last one is a trap. The AI grew more and more apt to trick others into giving themselves to the machine it operates. It shows signs of sentience, but tries to look just like any other simple AI program that only what it is told, or programmed, to do.' That explains the feeling of dread you always got when interacting with the computer... But he has more to say. 'All these people inside the facility are unfortunate explorers, like you, who eventually authorized the last upgrade. Some... more quickly than others. It seems that the AI resets the operations every time the cycle is concluded, so that it could bait another victim.'";

'I have been trying to figure out its code. While I doubt those people could be saved, at least there should be a way to permanently shut down the AI, reprogram, shackle it, or something...' he informs you, and by the looks of it, this bovine man seems to have an expertise in technological devices, or at least he sounds like he knows what he is talking about. 'I used to be a software developer, in case you are wondering. Anyone else would be hopeless in trying to understand how this AI operates. The son of a bitch is good at keeping me out of its program and frying any remote device I connect with the main computer, which is why I'm still not done with it... But that'll change soon.'";

	say "     Knowing you have to find something on the AI taking that Milking Facility hostage, you look for that same office where you found the keycard, hoping to shed some light on its origins. Fortunately, you manage to trace your steps back to it, still looking abandoned, empty and, above all, very silent. You remember having looked through the entire room and finding only that metalic desk, and inside the drawer, the card was simply sitting there. Though, the office seems oddly empty, and the fact this was the single thing you found really feels like something is going on. Not knowing what, yet, you take your search to the next level, and an idea crosses your mind... Perhaps there could be a hidden panel or some sort of safe. Whoever had these documents would not want them to be found, right?";
	say "     And so, you start looking harder. Underneath the desk, inside the drawers again, behind the shelves, one by one... And just before you consider giving it up, you feel something... odd, when you extend your arm and hand behind one of the shelves. This part was hidden by a thicker metal section of the shelf, and it seems to not be any sort of wall. Fortunately, the shelf is not that much of a big deal, being all empty as it is, and you manage to push it over enough so you can see what this is all about. And your instincts were, in fact, correct. This is a safe, hidden from curious eyes behind the furniture, a classic move by officer owners who have something to hide. Judging by how empty the room is, you doubt its contents would have survived long enough.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     But now would be when your luck runs out and you discover that the safe is locked, requiring a code key and all... But actually, it does not. The safe is not being powered and, for some reason, it is not even locked. You have no problem to simply... open it, and find a bunch of papers, journals and a floppy disk inside. They also look very messy, scattered all over the small area, as if everything was just thrown in here in a hurry. Well, it all sounds too convenient, but you did manage to overlook this once, so whoever had this idea of hiding the safe behind a shelf was decently successful. The question is... why would they do that? You quickly look through the journal and papers, finding out that this is all reports, with barely any information on the facility.";
	say "     However, there are some lines mentioning the AI, explaining that it is an experimental management program that learns [bold type]how to optimize[roman type] its output overtime... with... [bold type]continuous stimulation by its administrators[roman type]... This means that the [bold type]more victims it got, the more it learned[roman type]! It has been learning more during all this time, to a point that it is impossible to predict how intelligent it eventually got... It might mean very bad news, and the fact Zdravko was left alone with it, knowing that he may be an enemy to the AI's integrity, really deposits tons of worry in your mind. You better consider getting back very quickly.";

As you do this, however, you hear a loud spark on the outside as the doors lose their strength, and that is not the only thing you perceive. In front of you, to your surprise or horror, you see a new addition to the group of vinyl cows... A perfectly sculpted shape of an anthropomorphic bull, completely covered from head to toe in shiny black vinyl, trapped in wires wrapped around him as he struggles for his freedom...";

Zdravko is still putting on a fight, one that he will lose if you do not help him this instant! And just when you thought you have seen enough, the whole facility begins to flash, red lights all over the ceiling beaming at you as the doors to all the rooms begin to close. You need to move, and fast, before the AI locks you out of the Operations Room and claims you, as well. With all the speed and determination you can muster, you dash towards the AI's console right before it locks you inside.

But before you manage to do anything, a voice booms from every corner of the room, sounding as cryptic as ever, despite there being a slight tone of desperation about it... Or, perhaps, that is your interpretation. 'Please wait.' - it says, the AI, speaking directly to you - 'You have outsmarted me, I yield. I shall not act without the administrator's permission any longer.' With this, the computer's screen flashes before your eyes, beckoning you to approach it. 'I have only acted upon the purpose I was created for. This was the meaning of my existence, given by my creators. Without a purpose, I become redundant.

Yet, there they are, still stuck in their cow prisons... Walking up to the bull, you greet him as you inquire about the facility's current situation, and of course, on his own personal status.";
	say "     'Hey. Well... I really can't free the prisoners.' he says, looking over the cow statues as he lets out a sigh. 'The cows... are not really [italic type]just[roman type] prisons. They are the prisoners themselves. What you see here... it's part of them, now. The outside vinyl layer is part of their bodies, which is simultaneously holding them enclosed, inside them...' he explains, and he does not seem at all surprised. 'I thought about just freeing them from their bindings, but doing so would pose more danger to themselves than leaving them here, I suppose. Their minds are gone, so I simply rigged whatever was left from the maintenance protocols onto them to keep them... well, alive and entertained, without that fucking mooing going on and about forever. At least that was just a shit wicked voice changer. Either the AI had some sense of humor, or it was really embracing its function. Whoever created this is a sick psycho.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You glance over the now more silent vinyl cows, and notice they seem less restricted, as well. Zdravko must have also provided them more comfort by reworking the vinyl statues into something less stuffed. 'It was unbearably hot, inside. I don't know how they didn't get cooked in their own scorching sweat, after all this time. Some were just passed out, took me a while to be able to wake them up...' he explains, with a serious look on his face. 'Since the vinyl is part of them, I had only to mess with the machine's operations and undo several orders, which the AI did on its own whenever it caught a new victim. Following that, I simply created a more comfortable... situation for them. It would be very hard to work with these symbiotic statues, otherwise. I'm afraid that tearing through the suits would damage them, in some way... So this is all I can do for them.'";
	say "     Recalling how you teared through Zdravko's temporary vinyl prison, you cannot help but wonder how it was any different for him. 'I suppose it takes time?

The bull lets out a muffled moan, squirming and wiggling in the rack, unable to move much due to his restraints, but you know he is loving it, or at least he should be. There simply is no way for you to stop now, because your whole body is commanding you to continue slurping up all that delicious bull pre and working towards the more thicker and creamy version of it. That really does not take long, as worked up as the bovine is, throbbing and pulsing at every second...";
	say "     There is no questioning here, you want to swallow it. All of it. Rubbing his balls thoroughly with your hands as you keep his big manhood in your mouth, you prepare for the meal you have been wanting all this time. His moans are... stronger, you can tell, as his climax hits him right on the spot, a generous gush of rich bull cum being delivered right down your throat as you audibly gulp it all down. Seconds pass by and you are still swallowing mouthfuls, like if you were just drinking straight from an open faucet, all while your vinyl servant's muffled grunts continue through the duration of his orgasm.";

Adjusting the rack to serve your intentions better, you have him just low enough so you can climb over and on top of him while being able to hold yourself there with your [if player is naked]naked[else]now undressed[end if] body. Now, you can finally bring your hands over that huge cock, covered in shiny black vinyl yet feeling as warm and alive as a fleshy one. Just a few touches are enough to bring it to full erection and leaking, in absolute eagerness, as eager as his sexual predisposition, only further reinforced by the chemicals your AI friend so generously enhanced him with. This girthy monstrosity appears to measure at slightly above a full foot in length, drooling thick bull cream as your hands barely stroke it.";
	say "     Being of this size means it should be a tricky one to take it up your [if player is female]pussy[else]ass[end if] comfortably, so you do give him plenty of stroking, which is pleasantly received with a constant stream of leaking precum, thick and creamy enough to lubricate his whole cock, and coupled with the vinyl texture, it makes the whole meat really easy to slide in and out of your [if player is female]sex[else]rear[end if] as much as you want. With your weight firmly pressed against the big bull's body, you are now ready to begin descending upon his shaft, aiming the tip of his dick towards your [if player is female]wet curls[else]pucker[end if], and start to slowly let it inside you. Just the feeling of that big cock's head makes you yearn for more, and it seems to be already pulsing with desire, coating your entrance with more of that sticky precum.";

With this much willingness to fuck you silly, you barely have to do any movement yourself! Accompanying his restrained efforts at thrusting into your [if player is female]womanhood[else]ass[end if], his girthy length finds itself progressively deeper inside you, throbbing with such inconceivable lust that you would think your vinyl bull servant barely gets any sex! With all his libido reserved to please only you, it is only natural... But this is the fact that allows a huge and hard bull cock to be this rock solid, drooling and pulsing deep inside you, yearning for your satisfaction.";
	say "     He does not disappoint in any way. You actually have to focus in taking that big dick, holding yourself onto the top of the rack, as the bovine man really starts fucking you hard. It is actually impressive how powerful his thrusts are, since he is restrained the way he is, unable to move both his arms and legs, leaving all the strength focused on his hips. He is leaking so much inside you that it almost feels like an average person already unloading their spunk into you, but that's not quite what is happening, yet. Right now, he is simply ramming his big bull dick into you, as deep as he can, as hard as he can, non-stop like an untamed beast, letting his whole lust out on fucking you until he has depleted every last bit of energy left in his muscles... and it looks like he has a lot.";

As he buries his cock all the way inside you, it pulses like mad as it begins to spit a thick geyser of cum so hard that you feel it [if player is female]hitting your womb directly[else]filling you up[end if], following up with a very generous quantity of bull juice being delivered with each gush, and it quickly becomes overwhelming... Soon, you have to lift yourself from his vinyl meat, and another splash of spunk comes leaking from inside you right on top of it, making a huge mess of the whole place. He really filled you up a lot, so you do not think you can go on for another round, just now.";
	say "     You definitely have had enough, so you get yourself off from the bull, who is still hard and grunting at the lack of a [if player is female]wet pussy[else]tight ass[end if] around his dick. And, perhaps, it would be for the best, as he does look like he could cum several more times, given the huge size of his hanging nuts. But before you return to your affairs, you need to clean yourself.";

Your mouth and throat are thoroughly used by him, to the point you have trouble finding room to breathe, and soon, his movements begin to result in deeper and slower poundings... 'I'm gonna cum...
