Upon closer inspection, you realize the silhouette isn't quite human, and the more you approach, the more you conclude what kind of construct it is. A gargoyle, no less, and a fairly large one, complete with its privates dandling between the thick and muscular legs. Clearly a he, is immobilized at the moment, not breathing nor moving an inch, though by the looks of the area surrounding him, you guess that could immediately change if you got too close. The constructions seem to follow a safety perimeter, all man-built - so probably built by the gargoyle himself - and he must be resting still. Currently, he's sitting on a small stone pedestal, legs curled and back leaning forward, with each hand holding one knee of their respective size, and his eyes, albeit lifeless looking, are open, featuring on an face that looks like a mix between a dragon and a bat, with a pair of small horns on the top of the head. His wings are resting on each side of his body, also hanging still as a statue.";
		say "     Before you consider taking the risk, you attempt to scout around for anything of interest. It seems he keeps a few treasures in a chest, probably things he values a lot, but some of them could probably be useful to you. However, the pattern these stones seem to make concerns you, as they don't look exactly like randomly placed rubble. There's an ominous sensation coming from them, and knowing how some stuff can unexplainably come to life around here, you think your presence would be able to disturb the surrounding area, and looking at how big he is, you know it'd be a very bad idea to go in carelessly. Maybe if you were small or light enough, you could cross this perimeter without alerting the gargoyle... ";

	say "     Down the hatch goes a shroom, and you start feeling the effects almost immediately. The world around you shifts before your eyes as you feel yourself shrinking to only a few inches tall, [if player is not naked]having even shrunk through your gear and getting completely naked[else]your already naked body remaining as such, even more exposed to danger[end if]. Adrenaline rushes with the anticipation of attempting your dangerous plan before you dare to take a tiny step towards the stone perimeter. Relief arrives down your shoulders as your tiny feet makes it forward without anything out of the ordinary happening, so you start walking around slowly and, effectively, everything goes according to plan. Now that you're inside the safety perimeter, it's time to explore!";
	say "     The muscular gargoyle sleeps soundly and still, looking menacingly huge from your perspective of view. You don't even want to imagine what he could do to you being of that size if he suddenly came to life and saw an intruder so small and vulnerable, meaning you shouldn't linger for long. Making your way through the rudimentary stone pavement, you head directly towards the place where you've seen the goods, a much longer way than what it would be if you were normal sized... But you manage, after about a few minutes of walking. Then, you climb up through some stones, a task surprisingly easier to accomplish while you're tiny and light, and walk over the edge of some sort of chest. Luckily, it's not closed, as there are a few objects holding the top up in place. The bottom shines, as there must be a few valuables in here!";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Carefully, you slide down through what seems to be a large copper ingot, and land on a solid surface. More ingots of many kinds cover the bottom of the chest, shining in various colors and sizes, but all in the same shapes, as expected. Seems like the gargoyle has a knack for collecting these kinds of stuff, but now another problem arises... You're too small to carry any of this! Ingots are heavy and long, you'd be lucky if you could manage to shove even a small one out of the chest, and even then, these things would hit hard once they fell to the ground, and it would be noisy to drag them across the stones. But you're not ready to give up, yet! There must be something you can bring with you... right?";
	say "     You search the inside of the chest thoroughly, but unfortunately... no luck. Seems like your idea to shrink and pass by unnoticed was brilliant in only one way, because you're not able to take anything with you. You could sell these ingots for some creds to anyone interested, only if you could transport them out. A misfortune, but at least you know it's not anything too valuable or worth running the risk of being smashed to death by a big bad manly gargoyle if he ever awakened and saw you as a menace. With disappointment, you figure it's time to leave the inside of the chest, so you make your way back by climbing up through the ingots and onto the edge of the treasure container.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Breathing outside air once more, you take a careful look around you, and towards the gargoyle. He's still dormant, and nothing strange happened while you were here. Pointless as this trip might have been, at least you have the opportunity to admire the work of art this beautiful statue is. Each muscle is flawlessly sculpted, almost as if it was a real organic being, and something about the creature strikes you with sheer power. Then, since you're leaving with your hands empty, an idea comes to mind... Realizing you're able to climb through stuff with ease, and never having seen such a gorgeous sculpture so up close while being as small as you currently are, how about you [bold type]go on a little adventure and explore this gargoyle's body?[roman type][line break]";

You'd be turned into powder, for sure... So it's better to just take your leave through the same path you took when you first arrived, then wait out the effects of the shrooms to subside. It takes a while, but soon you feel yourself regaining your normal size, able to proceed with your usual affairs and re-equip yourself. You also take note of this place, in case you come across it in a near future with the new knowledge you have just acquired.";

	say "     If you're careful enough, it won't even notice you're here. So you carefully bypass the chest and head towards the stone pedestal where the gargoyle is sitting on, and readying yourself to climb it up, you stretch your arms once more and give enough balance to jump over, grabbing the edge with both hands and bringing your body onto the top. From here, you can have a very clear view of his large clawed feet, holding against the pedestal firmly. They're not connected to the ground, which confirms your suspicions of this being one of those [']magic['] gargoyles. But looking between the thick thighs has you meeting an enormous manhood, long and smooth, hanging soft between his legs. Its tremendous size is only scarier when you're this small, but you're sure it would still be massive at your normal size! Beneath it, an equally sizable pair of testes hang heavily below, only overshadowed by the legs and the shaft, but they seem rather swollen.";
	say "     This visage gives you the chills... but you're able to take a good gaze at the masculine gargoyle's virile details, and the rest of his beautiful body, incredibly huge compared to you, from a delicious angle. [bold type]There's even an unexplainable musk coming from his parts, as if it were alive...[roman type][line break]";

	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     This naughty idea doesn't leave your mind. How hot it is to face an exposed penis that can be as big as you're tall while soft, looking so smooth and appealing to the eye, and being just a few centimeters away from it, without any obstacle between it and you to keeping you from getting closer? How can you pass this opportunity? And surely, as light as you are, maybe you can just... have your fun without waking him up? A risky idea, but one that you can't miss. With the decision made, you bolster up the courage to step towards the gargoyle's considerable cock, the musk indeed becoming stronger, almost as if you were approaching an alive being's parts... It fills you with adrenaline, but it also makes you horny, and between the two, you know which you want to satisfy.";
		say "     When you get close enough to touch it, you extend your hands and softly brush both the palms against the tip all around. To your surprise, it feels warm and oddly smooth, as if the stone was polished to the very point of it being so soft and... even slightly squishy, like a real dick. But the thought doesn't set you off, much the contrary, as you continue to rub down through the solid shaft, completely lost in the sensation. You're even able to bounce it around realistically, and the more you do, the warmer it gets... and then it shakes slightly within your grasp. Your eyes widen as the sculpture's dong hardens slowly, growing further beyond, getting erect as you massage the entire thing.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     This dick in its fully erect state is clearly much bigger than you, and so heavy it could probably crush you beneath if it ever fell on top of you. Since it becomes so hard, it lifts off the ground, and you're either forced to give up or attempt to climb to the top of it. You choose the second option, making your way through the base, bringing yourself up onto the top of the throbbing rod. Then, relocating towards about half of the cock, you put your arms and legs around his thickness to feel it all over beneath you...";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     ...Then suddenly, you hear a breath. A heavy one, inhuman, deep and very audible, almost monstrous, sound surging through the entirety of the gargoyle's body. Your heart starts beating at double the speed, your body immobilized and frozen in sudden fear, as you see both of the massive creature's arms moving slowly towards you. However, he does not hurt you... Instead, he seems to sit back comfortably, stretching his powerful legs forward, and bringing his full erection to poing up, with you still tugged on it. A powerful hand envelops you from the back, carefully rubbing you across the pulsing shaft, surprisingly gently. You look up at his face, his eyes now giving a dimming faint light through the black coal sclera, pointed towards you. He looks real, alive, and feels so much as such, that you could forget that he's made of stone...";
		say "     He does not direct any word towards you, instead continuing to jerk off his cock with you tugged around it. Your body around the throbbing shaft feels just too hot to not get turned on by the whole thing, your own existence smothered between it and the gargoyle's hand, bringing you up and down through the entirety of his length. He breathes of life, deeper in both intensity and sound, as he starts to slow down his stroking only to bring you closer to the glans. You can't almost believe your eyes when you see that he can actually leak precum, and not just a tiny bit of it, but copious amounts of it, enough to drown you in a single drop...! Feeling his ridiculously massive meat pulsing in arousal, you know he's about to do something naughty for his own enjoyment, and that follows up with having your face shoved against the oozing slit.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Serves you right for being so attracted to his musk, that now you're being forced to swallow any of the statuesque creature's juices as long as he wants, and the more he presses you against it, the harder he becomes and the more he leaks out. Each drop is enough to fill your mouth, and you can barely find a second to breath with his heavy finger pressed against the back of your head, holding you in place. Then, out of the sudden, the gargoyle huffs and pushes himself forward, landing on the ground on fours with a massive earthquake almost able to shake you off our own existence, his hand holding you against his cock and keeping you from suffering a very bad fall. Now the beast's prick is on top of you, drooling its liquids freely on top of you for a moment, its heavy weight almost crushing you underneath...";
		say "     But he's just getting started. You get a feeling he might be punishing you from intruding, but since you got him horny, he's probably doing it in a way that takes care of both problems... Or at least you'd like to think that. His ever throbbing erection only craves for more friction, and soon you find yourself getting brushed and rubbed against the massive shaft, over and over, up and down the long pole that's eager to explode. He's so turned on that you can even see his hips jerking back and forth, sometimes his hand standing still as he lets his body do all the movement. It gets almost unbearably hot between you and his dick, only worsening as he comes closer to the edge...";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Then with an abrupt movement, he brings you down to the ground, a little too harshly for comfort, then gets his trunk thighs down to his knees as his rock hard cock is pointed directly at you. With a wicked grin on the beast's expression as he strokes faster and faster, the tip being only mere inches away from you, it's only a few seconds before your vision blacks out. An enormous and thick splat of cum hits you right on your face, covering it completely and throwing you back to the floor, as more and more of it falls directly on you, coating you under numerous and seemingly endless layers of his generous load, completely immobilizing you and keeping you to drown underneath, almost as if you were trapped in amber! By the waves you keep feeling, the gargoyle doesn't stop cumming for a very good while, enough to cause you start feeling lightheaded for the lack of air...";
		say "     However, you suddenly feel something heavy pressing against you, more and more, squishing all the cum against you, forcing some of it to slip to the side, then you feel yourself getting dragged around in a rather slippery pool, until the ground feels hard and harsh once more. Fortunately you're able to catch a breathe and shove some of the suffocating load off your face, but you can't say the same for the rest of your body, trampled under the monstrous beast's clawed foot. He pressed on downwards one time, then another, each harder than the last, and you almost feel your bones cracking from the force... Then, he keeps you there, on the verge of breaking, for a long minute... Until he lets go, his heavy foot landing just a few inches to your side with tremendous strength, causing the earth to shake around you!";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The gargoyle doesn't speak, but eyes you intimidatingly, the message being clear in your head. Then, he streches his wings, his overshadowing and statuesque dimension enough to truly make you shit your pants - if you had them on - as he takes a step back, only to kick you away of his territory. You're sent flying across a few meters, ending up just outside of the stone perimeter, now covered in both dirt and cum as the gargoyle takes his spot above the stone pedestal, his manhood still giving signs of arousal even as it [']tries['] to return to its soft state. There's a satisfied smirk on his face as he turns into an immobile statue once more.";
		say "     Meanwhile you... Well, you've learned your lesson. Your body hurts all over and you're still dizzy from everything. Just do not mess with a gargoyle sentry ever again.";
		WaitLineBreak;

You breath of relief once you've made it out in one piece, succesfully not waking up the gargoyle even with the risk you just took. Taking a deep breath, all that you have left now is waiting for the shroom effect to disappear, so you're able to return to your usual affairs and re-equip yourself.

There is nothing to be said about the chapel, except that is small and unidentified, ornamented with objects and symbols, possible of religious nature, that you don't recognize.

to say KrumirrDesc:
	say "     Krumirr is a gargoyle, and a fairly large one, complete with its privates dandling between the thick and muscular legs. Currently, he's standing on a short stone pedestal in a squatting position, with his back slightly leaning forward, and both arms converging towards the center between his clawed feet. His eyes, albeit lifeless looking, are open, featuring on an face that looks like a mix between a dragon and a bat, with a pair of small horns on the top of the head. His wings are resting on each side of his body, also hanging still together with his statuesque frame. The now grey hard skin can turn into a dark blue shade of stoneflesh and his eyes lit with fiery orange irises whenever you move to awaken him.";

It feels just like its fleshy version, yet more solid, like a smooth statue that has been warmed by the sun, and you can definitely feel the pulses, even the veins around his cock, simply hardening to a level you never thought possible at the very slight movement. Putting both your hands around his shaft, you start jerking him, slowly and steadily at first, with the occasional grope of his balls, which have swollen by now with increasing quantities of his seed churning inside.";

He keeps going at it for what seems to be an entire minute, begging you not to stop during his whole orgasm, until the very last drop simply leaks and drips from the tip of his solid manhood.";

Once I... feed my cock, that is. You've emptied my balls!' With a shrug, you let him know that you'll consider repeating this in the future, if you both feel like it, to which he responds with a sudden, almost bone-crushing hug, with his hot, rock hard body grinding against yours in a very painful way. 'Wish I could keep you forever in here! You're so fun to have around...! The things we could do toge-...' - he stops, realizing he's choking the life out of you, and letting go of you immediately - 'O-oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! T-this keeps happening...'";

His statuesque dimension is even more pronounced once you are the size of a little doll, tiny enough to fit in his palm or be squashed under his clawed feet, but he simply waits until the transformation is complete. His raging boner throbs impossibly hard, were it not for his flesh being already made of a stone hybrid, though puns aside, he really gets turned on from perceiving such a size difference between you. With a mischievous grin, he then grabs you gently, placing you between his fingers, and lifts you over to the same level as his eyes.";

Now I've got a new plaything to spend my next hours with! It goes well with the fact that you deserve a punishment for walking in without permission.'

Object	Name
Chapel Of Abyss	"Chapel Of Abyss"

Chapel Of Abyss is a room. It is sleepsafe.
Description of Chapel Of Abyss is "[ChapelAbyssDesc]".

to say ChapelAbyssDesc:
	say "     This small chapel is surrounded only by darkness when its doors are closed behind you. Inside, you can see various different mementos, artifacts and talismans of different shapes, sizes and colors, all seemingly related to some sort of cult or religion. The floor is made of polished stone, and there is a pedestal in the center of the furthest wall where the Gargoyle Sentry poses during his dormant slumber. When he lets you in, his bright orange eyes are part of the scenery, no matter in which direction you glance towards.";

instead of smelling Chapel Of Abyss:
	say "     The scent you get from this place is the same as the Gargoyle's animalistic essence. Besides that, there is a whole feeling of nothingness. Where else would you be able to detect a similar smell...?";

Gargoyle Sentry ends here.
