The sound of dirt scraping between your feet and the asphalt is only thing you hear now as you keep walking through the cemented field, without any signs of life other than yours. The mist disturbing your vision causes your eyes to itch slightly, forcing you to thread carefully as you try to glance around to get to know your surroundings. It appears you've been caught in the middle of some troubling wind as you're crossing a wide road to the next block of buildings straight ahead. You try to make it through quickly, rubbing your teary eyes in an attempt to clear off the dirt as you slip yourself into a sheltered street. It is easier to proceed now, unhindered from any dusty wind as it is blocked by the buildings surrounding you.";
		say "     Amidst your walk, you start feeling some sort of reverberation, one that feels unnatural to you. It's as if you were straying near a reactor core, an ominous sound that nearly makes you feel dizzy. It's when you approach a crossroad that you hear a strange, high pitched voice mumbling from the left, a narrow turn leading to a dark alley. With caution, you lean over the wall and slow down your pacing, reaching over to the corner so you can attentively glance towards the area. Doesn't take you long to catch an eye on what seems to be a tiny crimson whirling portal and a small red figure flying. An imp, of all the possible creatures, dumping trash from the wormhole on the floor. There are waste containers about, but you know better than to hope this specific creature would even care about proper places for junk.";

Turns out the imp's name is Krokleet, and he's complaining about his life as a servant. 'All this useless trash! Why don't they take it out themselves?!' he yells as he finishes throwing another sack of junk into the floor. Realizing what the imp is dumping away comes from a realm you could not have visited before, it's likely that you could find something interesting if you dug around the pile of trash he's making. There might even be some demonic related items that could be useful in the future. One's trash can definitely be another's treasure in this case.";

While it's still windy, nothing compares to the other day, when it was so bad it filled your eyes with dust. With a much easier time now, you cross the road, heading into the building blocks and slip into the street between the two edifices. You pay attention to your surroundings all the time, to see if you can detect that energy which took you to the short demon.";
			say "     Your efforts prove to be fruitful, as the reverberation you heard before is here, tingling around your ears as you proceed deeper into the street. When you make it to the narrow crossroad, you lean over the wall and check the alley. Krokleet is there, mumbling some bad words as he carries on his usual duty. 'It never ends, this damned junk! Why do they keep bringing random prisoners' stuff with them?! This is all useless! Trash!' In a great mood as always, the imp keeps dumping more trash onto the floor. He doesn't seem aware of your presence yet, allowing you to make several choices.";

to say DemonicRitualTape:
	say "     At the beginning of the tape, you see plain darkness, only the cracking steps on dry wood echo through the walls of this yet unknown place. Only then, a faint light reveals the presence of a man, holding a flashlight in the lens['] direction. He glances around with the luminous source as he searches for a way to keep the room illuminated, finally deciding to place it on a nearby table. By the time he makes it back to the camera, an odd feeling of familiarity strikes you as the bookshelves can now be seen surrounding the place. Then, a clear and deep voice sounds from behind the perspective as the camera starts moving. 'There, this should do it. Might only require a few additional items.' You see his hand throwing the contents of some strange vials into a red pentagram drawn on the ground. He does this while holding the camera, and when he points downwards, you see a strange, old looking book by his feet.";
	say "     He carefully reaches down to grab it, what actually seems to be a tome, and opens it with a slight hump. The lens are focused on the symbols in the worn pages, which look ancient. The language is quaint, but he seems to go over it loud and clear without any difficulty, as if he was an expert on the matter. With a pronunciation like you've never heard before, he lowers the tome as he finishes speaking, the pentagram glowing with a dark aura, accompanied by an odd sound of energy flowing around the drawn figures. This makes the flashlight dim, and suddenly, a flash bursts through the room. The man steps back in surprise, as the brief absence of light is broken by a red mist forming above the wooden floor.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Was something wrong in the formula? I thought...' his words are interrupted when an odd portal tears through the fabrics of space. 'A direct portal to Hell? But it shouldn't look like this...' You realize, by the surprised tone of his voice, that he summoned something he did not expect. He backs away, as he places the camera on a nearby table, pointing towards the portal. Now you can see his full human shape, wearing some kind of robes, contrasting with the dimming red luminescence, holding the tome in his left hand as the other hovers above the ancient pages, as they seem to somehow leaf through on their own.";
	say "     Out of nowhere, a large purple hand bursts out of the portal, his thick fingers ending in pointy dark claws stretched open, then forming a fist forward as more of the powerful arm reveals itself. A brutish form, covered in hard and powerful muscles, passes through, stepping on the pentagram with heavy steps as his red glowing eyes are fixed on the human. The demon brute grins with his menacing sharp teeth, stroking his huge erection while slowly making his way towards the vulnerable ritualist. Cautiously, the human steps to the side and lets go of the tome a little further away, without any sudden moves, and returns to his previous position. He lets the demon approach him, and surprisingly, his massive purple hand gently reaches for the back of the man's head, almost covering it entirely. Although, this is where the brute's sympathy ends, as the much shorter human is forced on his knees, without any resistance from his part.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The robed man doesn't waste any time, getting his lips around the demon's hard-on, pulsing with eagerness. The hellish fiend lets out a grunt, only to force his cock deeper into the man's mouth, nearly dislocating his jaw. He doesn't stop there, making the ritualist flinch helplessly as the demon shoves it down his throat, the human now kneeling right between the brute's thick and muscular legs. With his large manhood now deep inside his summoner's throat, the demon brute starts thrusting back and forth, mercilessly fucking the much weaker human's mouth. His struggling to breathe only excites the beast even more, as the ritualist is relentlessly facefucked, the demon's massive pair of balls slamming against his chin with every motion.";
	say "     Holding his summoner's head tight with both his hands, the demon keeps on going for a good long while before he loosens his grasp, allowing the man to have a few desperate gasps for air. This brief mercy is over not too shortly after, as the massive brute grabs the man by his hair and pulls him up towards himself. Growling at his face with his threatening grin, the hellish fiend pushes the ritualist against the bookshelf, easily tearing his robes off thanks to the sharp, coal colored claws adorning the demon's large hands. With a loud slap, the brute feels up the human's bubble cheeks, shoving one thick finger up his tight hole, causing the young man to groan in mild pain. Still, the ritualist arches his back, to which the demon responds with a pleased grunt.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With his throbbing erection in one hand, the hellish brute keeps fingering the man's hole, slipping in another finger in his tight ass as the young researcher moans helplessly. This only makes the demon hornier as he stretches the human's ass even further, burying more of his thick fingers inside. By the time he's done preparing his summoner, the demon begins rubbing the already soaked tip of his pulsing length against the young man's rear. With a thrust, the brute sinks his manhood inch by inch inside the ritualist's hole, who squirms in a mixture of pain and pleasure as he feels his own ass trying to accommodate the biggest cock that has ever entered him. The demon shows no mercy, pounding that ass like there's no tomorrow, intensifying as the wooden shelf which the human is holding onto cranks audibly.";
	say "     The following next minutes are filled with flesh on flesh clapping, beast-like grunts and whimpering moans, then suddenly, the hellish fiend grabs his summoner, holding the man tight against his own demonic muscular frame, while still deep inside his ass, and turns him towards the camera, giving you an overshadowed front view of the human getting pounded hard by a demon brute. His motions get even more intense, and the demon's balls begin to retract. It's not too long until a loud roar of pleasure is heard echoing through the library, as the demonic fiend reaches his climax, filling the young man's bowels full of corrupted seed. It's so much that some leaks out of his ruined hole and starts forming a pool of thick cum beneath them.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     When you think this is over for the poor human, the portal's light dims again, and another hand tears through the crimson veil. You don't see one, nor two, but three more demon brutes coming out of the portal, with equally sizeable erections, pulsing with desire for some tight hole to breed. They must have followed the first, and do not intend to give the ritualist any time to breathe. With his cock still inside the man, the initial brute turns him over to his friends, slowly backing away from the exhausted young man as he leaves a trail of demon cum, still leaking from the human's gaping hole.";
	say "     Without any warning, one of the demons grabs the summoner's head, forcing his jaw open to take the massive erection deep down to his throat, while the others circle around him, rubbing their own lengths with eager lust. With his hole now more than ready, another of the brutes easily manages to grab the human's ass and shove his hellish cock deep inside. The demons spitroast the young man for quite some time, keeping him suspended between themselves and taking turns on both his ends, fucking and filling his insides with even more thick cum. Every plead of mercy is muffled by the unforgiving facefucking the ritualist is being given, and he's pounded hard and deep until nearly the end of the tape. That is, until they finally pause, only to drag the absolutely cum-coated human along with them through the portal.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     When they're about to disappear, one of the demons turns to the camera. With a curious grunt, he approaches it, tilting his head as he grabs the device with only one of his massive hands. Clearly he doesn't know what it is, but he simply decides to take it with him. This could explain how you were able to find the tape in such an odd manner. However, to your disappointment, the image cuts as soon as he crosses the veil, leaving you only with static noise. With nothing left on the tape to watch, whatever happened to the young man remains a mystery. You haven't seen him turning into one of them as it usually happens, and no ordinary human could flip a tome's pages without touching them. Now, if only you could find this grimoire...";

The book continues to elude you, no matter how thorough your search is. You begin to think that, perhaps, this is a waste of time... Maybe someone already came here and looted the tome, leaving with it to a far, far away place...";

A myriad of thoughts storm through your mind as you attempt to make sense of this, a current that is abruptly interrupted by the strangest whisper.";

Each line is meticulously calculated using reference points, to ensure they come out straight and clean. When you're done, you stand up and appreciate your careful work, and just looking at it gives you a mystic, yet disturbing vibe, a clear warning you're messing with something hellish. As for the required items, you prepare the solution by crushing the libido pill into powder, then sliding it over into the bottle of demon seed. You close the bottle and shake it slightly, to make sure it dissolves properly in the warm liquid. Now with both the pentagram and the items ready, you go over the arcane chant.";

With the theoretic revision done, you approach the pentagram... And remember there's still something missing. The candles on each of the pentagram's five edges.

There's no way to describe what you're feeling right now, but you've lost all the will to fight.

It doesn't take too long as you feel something viscous and slimy sliding by your head over to your neck, as you're feeling yourself being pulled deeper into one enormous pulsing fleshy tunnel.

When the energy subsides, you're able to look around and spot a dark-robed figure kneeling on the ground, said light merely gleaming from a gem in its possession. Could it be...?";

You rush to help him up and explain what happened, from when you woke up to this moment. 'It has been that long? That's a considerable delay...

Your world is getting more vulnerable to demonic presence, and that's just how everything began on mine. This ruby we recovered could be the key to stop the demons, either by stalling them or by allowing us to balance things. Having a gem this powerful in our possession may scare some of them.

Fortunately magic is a talent I always have possessed, and have always been great at it. However even I have to be careful handling such a thing.

Anyway, the Grid's purpose is to literally milk the bodies of the captured mortals for their sex and life juices. Why, you ask? Because those liquids carry faint levels of vital energy and is the only thing that can be reproduced. So they effectively turn the mortals into [']gold mines[']. Blood also carries said vital energy, although that'd kill the body, so it's undesirable. Of course, since the quantities are minimal, they must be enhanced and harvested daily.' he says, with an almost disturbing analytical tone.";

If they succeed, they might be able to evolve... so it's in our best interest that they fail no matter what. Demons can be fascinating in their beauty, I'll give them that, but the beasts they breed?

Except that now, for some reason, he isn't there. How odd is that, given the fact he spends literally all day browsing all the shelves - and even containers - for more material for his research? Maybe he went for a field exploration, but he usually tells you everytime he leaves the premises. You decide to bring up the summoning trinket, but as soon as you touch it, an immediate certainty tells you that he's still in the library. These magic things are really useful.";

Questioning yourself will make you no good if you're going to stay still wondering, so you go look for the half-demon in there.

It would benefit us both, I assure you.' he says, with absolute no shame nor hesitation, while there's a fully naked incubus tied up in the bed, enveloped by those strange purple tendrils your mage friend loves bragging about. They're currently wiggling around the demon's body, covering every sensitive spot of his, with one shoved right down his mouth, another in his ass, and a last one sounding the nine inch penis that is typical of his species. The poor thing can't even move an inch, as the tendrils are tightly holding his arms and legs against the mattress, together with the rope attaching his hands to the bed's bars. You do remember Xaedihr telling you these extensions of himself were wired to the pleasure areas of his brain, yet he remains completely unbothered by the tentacle work happening there.";

This allows me to conduct my research without any of those fancy machines the weird scientists from across the fields use. I find those very impractical, to begin with.' Given how Xaedihr speaks about the nanite experts, one could guess he knows more about them that he'd like to admit. You encourage him to continue. 'The objective here is to understand how their will works. What drives them to behave in such a way.'

No behavior associated with peril as long as I promised him a sweet release. A very easy capture, if you ask me. Now look at him, completely submissive.' he goes on, and you can't help but feel a little aroused at the whole scene. The sorcerer's tendrils seem to be jerking the incubus['] meat faster as the fleshy tubes thrust in and out of his hole and mouth, almost moving the demon around in the bed.

Sometimes they want to be felt...' The demon is soon driven over the edge, and you can see him jerking his hips uncontrollably as the sorcerer's extensions thoroughly milk the cum out of the incubus, in what seems to be an almost minute long orgasm.

I'll need to conduct another test.' he suggests, not really asking for your opinion on the matter. Retracting his tendrils back to oblivion, he then finishes up writing his notes and pile every document together. 'Not with this subject. The one I'm thinking of requires a less intelligent kind of demon. Perhaps a demon brute.

Xaedihr keeps up the pace with you, combining rhythms as you two fuck the incubus from both sides.

Here it comes!' He leans his head back, eyes closed, and lets out an almost beastly grunt that echoes through the entire chapel. You feel yourself needing to get a release too, and that comes by just as the cum leaves you, a torrent of seed being delivered right inside the incubus['] ass until the very last drop. Gulping sounds are loudly audible from the other side, as Xaedihr pumps out his own load, generous as ever, while Atticus seems to be struggling with swallowing everything, though you know how dedicated he is when pushed to the right ways.

'Tired already?' - he provokes with a giggle - 'Knew you couldn't resist me! Though it'd feel great if you retributed the favor.' he continues, and you notice his own foot-long of a demon cock still pulsing like the horny lusty demon he is. 'My tome, please.' requests Xaedihr as he extends his hand to you. Taking some time to remember where you put it, you go get it for him from a corner where you left it, handling over the grimoire with care.";

Both you and Atticus look at him with great curiosity, without a clue of what he's up to, until plenty of dark tendrils spawn around the young demon. 'Oh! Ooh! You can do that?! Fuck yes!' shouts the devil with eagerness, as he allows his body to get completely enveloped by the countless restless tentacle-like extensions of Xaedihr surging from the ground. Each member wraps itself around a sensitive spot, like his chest, cock and balls, a few even finding their way back in his ass. He's held in place by others that go around his legs, arms and torso, and your demon son stands immobilized as yet another tendril takes hold of his dick, carefully sliding itself in the slit. He's made to cum, the tendril getting hungrily fed from it, continuing to stimulate Atticus in every way possible.";

You can easily see it's Rane, thanks to his identifying oni features and atypical blue skin, just looking outside for a while. Before you can approach him, however, Xaedihr surprises you, coming from behind a bookshelf and walking in front of you. 'Since when you have [italic type]yōkai[roman type]living with you?' He asks, and all you can do is stare back at him. 'This is an Oni! They are extremely evasive... and especially almighty. Though unlike demons, they're not inherently evil or controlled by a bigger entity. They're just... themselves. Some have fought through medieval times, attempting to survive humans['] greed and all that. Sad stories... Maybe for another time.'

Rane raises his eyebrows in amusement, and a smirk forms in his lips as he eyes the half-demon from head to feet. 'Now, isn't that interesting... Aren't you that cute looking redhead who's always with his head buried in the books, down there? I see you a lot of times!' Rane anticipates the talking, throwing a chuckle in what you think it's a genuine attempt at making Xaedihr more comfortable. 'I-It's just... I'm a massive fan of your kind! I've studied the likes of you for years! All the myths and legends, species, from kitsunes to tengus, the entire folklore of your origins, and the onis are my favorites because they come closer to... I... I'm probably babbling a lot, aren't I?' Rane gives you a glare, and with a careful movement of his arm, gives the half-demon a friendly pat on the shoulder. 'How about we have a drink?' asks the oni, clearly entertained by Xaedihr's burst of enthusiasm.";
		say "     'Uhm... I'll have to refuse for now. I just came here to meet you in person. I'm still getting used to this place, familiarizing myself with every bit and corner of the library, but don't want to get too distracted from my research. My apologies.' the sorcerer replies, and he gives you a subtle signal asking you to accompany him out. Rane doesn't insist, aware that this might be a hard case of social ineptitude. 'It's alright, you now know where to find me. The offer is still up, if you change your mind.' he follows with a wink, and Xaedihr excuses himself with a slight bow, though you can see his face is flushed. Once again, the oni gives you an amused look before you have to return to the half-demon's side and hear him out, after he got so intimidated by this encounter.";

'You know I'm mostly a top, but when you see a guy like that, you start wondering things... Then I started to pop a boner as these images went in my mind... I'm definitely not used to this. I'm usually a cold prick, but I've been looking at... Rane, was it...? For quite some time before... And I didn't have the courage to walk up to him alone.' It's not everyday Xaedihr admits a weakness, or in this case, a little crush. 'But enough of this talk. I have to focus on important matters and... Well, maybe sometime I'll accept his invitation. No promises, though.' he adds, before you both make your final leave.";

Not sure if you want either of us just for yourself or if there's another reason I cannot comprehend, but fine... have it your way.'
