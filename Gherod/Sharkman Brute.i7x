'What? Oh, I thought you were one of those maniacs who fight literally every creature they see. Good to know ain't one of those!' He walks up to you and pats you on the back a little harder than you would feel comfortable with, and keeps his large hand on your shoulder. 'Not that I don't like fighting, but there's more fun ways to spend pent-up energy! Like partying or sex... Actually, do you wanna have some fun?'

What's wrong?' he asks, and you only look back at him with a grimace. 'Oh, sorry, didn't mean to hurt you all that much, I just sorta had to, uh... Defend myself!'";

Can't say I'm unpleasantly surprised...' he says, dropping the fight right there and then. 'So, now that you've done your thing, how about we have some fun together?

I wasn't expecting to be so easily outmatched! So, uh... I guess I lost, which means you get to do whatever you want to me or something like that, yeah?'

	say "     Looking at the two red tips already poking out of the slit on his crotch, you know exactly what kind of fun you could be having with this handsome sharkman. It almost seems like he read your mind just then, as these internal cocks begin to push themselves out, growing bigger by each seconds, while your eyes glance between them and his face. 'Well, the anticipation's kinda getting me... So, uh, would you like to blow me?' he goes ahead and asks, to which you nod, bringing a hand over each of his rods and stroking them to their highest erection point. 'Oh, fuck that feels good... I like having them both worked like that, it's double the pleasure... Doesn't compare to when I used to just have one!'";
	say "     You continue to jerk them as they keep on throbbing, putting a toothy smile on the sharkman's face. 'Yeaaah, that's great... Come put your mouth on one of them! I promise they taste great!' he asks, with the premise of a good time for the both of you. Seeing the sharkman so eager to get his dicks sucked, you figure it would be wise to not tease him about too much. Looking up at him and back down at his endowments, you bring your lips to the one to your right first and wrap them around the thick shaft. While they are not too different from a human's, their tips are pointier and somehow bend a little more, having enough flexibility to be prehensible while keeping most of its more familiar shape.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Now, all the remains is to bring that cock deeper into your mouth, with the other's shaft already rubbing against your left cheek. It seems he can also move them unlike most males, almost like an extra limb! 'Mmh... Yeah, you're good... warm mouth, careful with your teeth... Can't say the same about my mates back home, they're not nearly as good as you...!' Hearing his praise, you start to pick up the pace as you give him a proper blowjob to at least one of the cocks, the other being just left throbbing in your hand as you stroke it together with your oral efforts. This might seem like a lot to handle, but after a while, it does kind of feel natural to you. While it is double the work, it also seems to result in double the pleasure for the sharkman, just as he said.";
	say "     It is the way he smiles and how he cannot keep his breath under a steady rhythm that further encourages you to please him, a positive feedback that triggers your sense of accomplishment, besides his words of praise and appreciation. Feeling the impact of your efforts, you stop sucking on the first cock and move to the second, once more wrapping your lips around it and bringing it as deep as possible towards your throat. 'Oooh, damn... That's going deep, alright... Ungh, can you keep stroking the other one?' You do just that, returning your hand to the first cock you left and stroke it just like you did the previous. He appreciates you for it, 'Like that, yeah... Fuck, you're so good...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You merely keep this up, simply changing from one dick to another, sucking and stroking the one out of your mouth, to then have them trade places and repeat. As you keep alternating, the sharkman's sensations are refreshed, and this fact is, almost entirely by itself, responsible for making him precum like a pump tube with a leak. It has a salty taste to it, and definitely not an unpleasant one at that, with the sheer amount of liquid helping you twirl and slide your tongue around and across the tip, shaft and pretty much the whole thing a lot more easily. 'Fuuck, I swear I usually have more stamina than this, but you're taking such good care of me that I- ungh... I'm getting really close...'";
	say "     The messiest thing about this is that these are, indeed, two cocks, and the sharkman is one hell of a massive man. So, while you are sucking on one of his members, the other one is freely spraying precum all over your face, neck, sometimes shoulders... Whatever it catches. You can only imagine what it will be once he gets to blow his load! And that is an exciting image to picture once you hear him warn you of how close he is to hit his climax. Since he has been so communicative, you ask him if he would prefer if you slowed down, to which he replies 'No... Not really, I kinda wanna cum... Maybe grab the both of them and stroke them until I explode? It's gonna be a hard one... Or, wait... No, I know. Step back...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As you step back, the sharkman takes hold of both his cocks with one hand each and begins to stroke them, fixating his gaze on you, who is... pretty much in front of the danger zone. That seems to be exactly what he wants, as he continues to jerk faster and faster. 'Yeah, that's it! Let me give you a cum bath... That's the least I could do to show all my appreciation for- FUCK it's c-com- Oooh...!' Before he can even finish his words, he goes past his point of no return, and you expectantly brace for what is to come. Nothing would have prepared you for a powerful gush of sharkman cum right in your face, forcing you to close your eyes as both his dicks continue to shoot uncontrollably. 'Fuuuck! That's a lot...!'";
	say "     No, really, it is quite a lot. You even put your hands in front of your face because it is absurd, not only the quantity of it, but how this sharkman is nearly bruising your face with the power of those spurts! Exaggerations apart, it really is a massive load, soaking your face and upper torso with dripping jizz by the time he is nearly done with it. He promised you a cum bath, and he definitely delivered. 'Phew... I-is that done? Oh shit... That's a whole fucking lotta cum! We probably should wash that up before it dries...' You let him know that you shall take care of it once you are able to. 'Good, yeah... That was fun! Can we do that again in a bit? I should be ready to go very shortly.'";

He is an anthropomorphic muscular shark with black and white scales, with a few battle scars scattered all over his powerful body. The strength he possesses is evident, and the way he puffs his chest demonstrates an overflowing confidence that would intimidate any average person. Wearing nothing but his own naked figure, he begins to move towards you menacingly... Though, this entire posture and apparent attitude is then contradicted by a sudden, unexpected cheerfulness. Flexing his muscles and still grinning, he greets you and prepares for what you think could be a fight. 'Hey you! How about a little sparring? It'd be cool to fight someone as a warm up!'";

to say SharkmanBruteSBCEvent:

He then walks up to you and places his hand on your opposite shoulder, prompting you to walk with him. 'Would you like to see where I'm living? Yeah, it's not here in this weird place, we have a sort of a [bold type]beach camp[roman type] that we found out it is somehow connected to this place by an underwater passage. I... don't think you could get through on your own, it's a bit of a long one and tricky to navigate, but I know the way and could take you there! I'm a really good swimmer! And I'd really love if you got to know about this place before you left!'";
	say "     You could consider his offer, but quite frankly, why would you not accept his help to explore this place? It is not like he is some sort of shark person who could lure you into a trap only to eat you or something... 'I promise it's a fun place! We throw parties in there, we even got someone making drinks, the sea just for us, and we can fuck a whole lot too! And, yeah, I know that maybe venturing into a shark den might not sound like the best idea, but I promise we're all cool dudes. Just... dudes, yeah. The shark women were a little, uh... too fierce.' Well, all you can do is give it some thought, though he seems to really want to have you come along.";

	if Player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     It does seem this sharkman genuinely appreciates your company and looks forward to build a friendship with you, so you see no reason to refuse his offer. Nodding along, you let him know that you shall come with him, but you do have questions regarding this underwater passage, as you cannot really breathe under these conditions... Or as far as you know. 'Oh, right! I think I can fix that. I did tell you I'm a great swimmer, so I can just hold you and take you there at full speed. Then, if you need air, I can always... give you some.' He scratches the back of his neck with mild embarrassment, and you can only wonder if that means he is suggesting some sort of mouth-to-mouth thing. 'Just in case you need it, of course! I would never take advantage of that situation...'";
		say "     Well, with the biggest problems taken care of, you tell him to show you the way. 'Oh, sure thing! It's through here, there's a lake nearby just past these woods. I've marked the way with a few scratches on the trunks! Or more like chomps... I used my teeth.' This cunning decision might have saved you a lot of time as these woods can be quite confusing, but the sharkman finds his way pretty easily. This lake he mentioned is actually in the middle of the swamp area, where it is humid and dark. Nobody would think this could lead to a beach, so you find it important to ask him if he is sure this is the right way. 'Trust me, it is! I know what it looks like, believe me when I say I also thought it was weird as fuck!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The sharkman then beckons you to come closer to the lake, which is mostly green and filled with moss. It definitely is not a place you would want to take a dive in. 'So, uh... You're gonna be soaked, but hopefully we'll only have to take one trip!' he says, and you ask why he could not just give you the location. Maybe you could find a way around these lands and meet him on the other side. He is quick to reply to that, however, 'There's no reason to not take this path! It's much quicker and safer! For me, at least... As for you, well... I guess if you can find your way into High Rise District and head towards the coast, you could find us...' he walks in front of you as he speaks, 'Or you could just come with me!'";
		say "     As he says this, he pulls you to him, hugs you closely, and then... You are forced to dive with him into the water, causing a loud and messy splash everywhere. The scare made you gasp, which was a good thing, because you are being brought deeper and deeper into the water as the sharkman swims at an incredible speed! His grip is powerful and tight, but also very secure, as he just continues to swim into this underwater passage and beyond while you do your best at holding your breath. Despite the length he mentioned, there always seems to be a sort of blue-ish light illuminating this tunnel, and an oddly unnatural one at that. Midway, it gets harder to hold your breath, but the sharkman, being aware of this, brings your mouth to his, which sustains you until the end of the trip...";
		say "     Being a sort of amphibious hybrid creature has its perks, and it all proves to be worth it once you finally arrive at your destination...";

		say "     Eventually, you are allowed to take a deep breath of fresh air as the sharkman emerges from the water, much clearer in comparison... And saltier. You cannot even tell how long you have been swimming with him, or rather, being carried over by him, but you sure are glad to be safe. 'There! We've just arrived! You good?' he asks with a silly cheerful smile that, pretty honestly, kind of looks a bit terrifying from this up close with all those teeth, though there is a slight bit of dorky adorableness to it. Still, you cannot help but feel a tad annoyed at how he pushed you into the water like that, so you give him an earful on how that is wrong and reckless. 'Hey, I knew we'd get here safely! Trust me, one of the things I know best besides fucking is swimming! And you're fine, aren't you? That's what matters!'";
		say "     You really have to roll your eyes, but at least you are fine, indeed. And this beach seems to be quite nice, once you take some time to glance over your surroundings. 'This is where I and my mates live. We used to be on the main beach way over there,' he points north as he says this, 'But things didn't work out with the shark women, as they had this odd focus on behaving like pirates... We just wanna have fun, you know? So we traveled here and set up a camp... And the rest, well, you know.' It seems the sharkmen here have been getting through just fine, though if this is a camp, this must mean they may have some sort of leader, perhaps, so you ask him about it. 'Leader... Hm, I guess I'd be the closest to that...'";

You let him know you shall consider, now that you are here, either way. Though, you have to ask him how to navigate this area, as currently you feel quite disoriented. 'Oh, right! So, if you head over there,' he then points south, towards the end of the beach and the lower point of the surrounding cliff, 'You can climb up that elevation and you should see High Rise District. That should be pretty much all you need to know, really... We tend to prefer to keep away from that place, and now that we can scout that forest... I think it's called Avalon...? Well, it has been a far better place to explore, even though it strangely had a few odd effects on us...'";
		say "     You can only ask what odd effects were those, and after throwing a chuckle, he replies, 'Our bodies! We're fucking beasts since we've been eating stuff from there! We even had to enlarge our shacks, and I can't even use my campervan anymore... Though, it seems the growth stopped for me. Not all of us were affected, however, but almost everyone was. We used to be just, like, a few inches taller than when we were human, basically. Now it's more like a few feet. Not that I'm complaining about it, honestly it just feels amazing...' Speaking of which, you now worry that you will not be able to take that passage on your own... 'Ah, well... If you ask nicely, I can take you back and forth, so don't worry. Your traveling won't be hindered in any way.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     If that is the case, maybe you could explore this beach a little bit and let Skyler be on his way. You let him know that you shall take a look around. 'Sure thing! You can find me in this area, mostly. Just ask around if you can't see me. Oh, and I'll let the folks know you're a welcome guest.'

If we don't ever meet again, it's been nice anyway...' Now, you obviously made him sad, but he is already walking away, dragging his shark tail through the ground in such a defeated marching...";
