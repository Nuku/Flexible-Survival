to say DullahanBlow: [player blows the Dullahan]
	say "     Eyeing the Dullahan's muscular body, your gaze eventually ends up fixated on his meaty cock, already throbbing with anticipation as his pale blue skin remains exposed for your delight. The statuesque knight towers over you, and you don't even need to kneel in order to kiss his two feet long dick, as it stays on eye level with you while standing. As soon as you include your tongue sliding by the side of his shaft, you feel a supernatural growling coming from him, his deep sounding voice groaning in your mind as you make a real effort at worshipping his lengthy erection. Few words are exchanged between you as your hands slowly stroke his cock, licking over the sides and circling around the tip with the same steady pace, and though you feel you're pleasing the Dullahan, he appreciates your efforts patiently, without rushing you.";
	say "     You take this as a signal that you should take your time, and so you do exactly that. With a slight twist of your head, you place your tongue at the base of his shaft while moving your hands to the tip, and tease his glans with your thumb by gently rubbing it across the sensitive surface. Moving your lips, you go around the length's perimeter, as you're able, and lick your way back to the tip through the shaft's underline, slipping your tongue across his slit to get a taste of that oozing precum, which turns out to be a mix of saltiness and sweetness in taste, caressing your taste buds and inviting you to take more. One of your hands reach for his goose egg-sized balls, feeling heavy in your grasp, and you give them an appreciative squeeze which seems to make the Dullahan's prick pulse repeatedly.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     It is then that you feel his still gloved hand reaching for the back of your head, almost too gently for a warrior, and a slight pressure for you to not move your lips away from the purple rosy head. You take the message, and figure it's time to allow some of the cock in your mouth, as you let your lips stretch around his considerable thickness. The difficulty is obvious when attempting to take such a big dick inside, though you do your best at managing what's humanly possible to achieve. The knight doesn't push it, aware of your physical limits, though he encourages you to do your best by caressing your cheeks and chin. You're very unfamiliar with this nice side of him, though it's a motivation to keep worshipping his manhood.";
	say "     After a few inches rammed against the back of your mouth, you stroke the rest with both your hands, ramping up the pace as your motions hasten. With vigorous movement, you move your hands through his shaft while sucking on the head, causing the demonic knight to jerk his hips slightly and his ballsac to heavily swing back and forth. You just know, by looking at the size of his cum factories, that the load you're about to get from him will be huge! Hearing his deep voice rumbling in your mind, between grunts and moans, is an indicative that the moment will soon happen, so you do your best at stroking, sucking and licking his huge meat, and not long after, you feel the almost monster-sized cock throbbing unceasingly.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A little of precum teases your tongue as your head is held tight between the Dullahan's large hands, and he starts thrusting into your mouth before a single, thick blast of cum coats its insides, followed by more equally sizeable spurts that are way too much for you to contain. After the third, it's your face getting splooged, and the Dullahan's orgasm is only gaining force as the next shots go over your forehead, completely covering you in the thick white cream as it drops down through your ears and neck. His climax keeps going for a good while until you're completely drenched from the neck up, a few last drops still finding their way outside through his two feet-long prick and landing right on your face. He pushes you back a little, squeezing his dick all the way towards the tip, making yet another full drop of seed slip away.";
	say "     Once again, his speech moves itself into your mind, gently this time. 'It's been very long since I had a mortal like you please me this much. You truly are something else...' he says, patting you in the shoulder. 'Now go. We have already spent enough time and I have my duties to attend to.' With this said, he grabs his loincloth and turns around, walking away. You're left drenched and sticky, and you have no choice but to return to your realm as well.";

to say DullahanFuck: [player fucks the Dullahan]
	say "     Eyeing the Dullahan's muscular body, you then wonder to yourself if the mythical knight would be up for a fuck in the ass. Without hesitation, he turns around and bends over, showing off his solid rear, filled with muscle mass and so plump that it would make a power bottom envious. Between his powerful glutes is an inviting asshole, twitching as your gaze stays fixated on it, inevitably causing you to pop a boner at the sight of a towering knight offering his ass to you. A newfound rush builds within you as [if player is naked]your length stays proudly erect, immediately giving it a stroke[else]you promptly remove your clothes and give your length a stroke[end if] as you watch. But you know better than to just ram your cock in him, you need to truly appreciate his ass and prepare his seemingly tight entrance.";
	say "     With this in mind, you approach the Dullahan and bend just a little - as necessary, because of his statuesque height - take a grab of those meaty cheeks and spread them to slide your tongue across his hole. Your actions cause the massive knight to shiver, and you feel him moaning in your mind as you start working his rear, circling your tongue around his pucker at first, before pressing it inside. It is actually not as tight as it seemed, opening itself around your tongue with ease as your wet and delicate touch licks him thoroughly. Suddenly you feel his colossal butt pushing against you, and you find your face buried between his glutes with your tongue wiggling inside, a signal that the mythical horserider is truly enjoying your treat.";
	WaitLineBreak;

After a couple of gentle and playful thrusts, you then slide your tip over the trail to his pucker, then push your manhood in. His ass takes you with little effort and feels tight all the same, enough for you to slide your entire length in. You feel like the Dullahan could take about any size with his stature, and the way his hole seems to hungrily squeeze your dick inside hints that it isn't a design by chance.

His hole proves to be too good for your stamina, as you're already feeling your climax building up with all the pleasure you're feeling. The Dullahan senses this in you, and doesn't let you finish just yet. First it seems like he just doesn't want you to cum inside him, but then you see him turn around, push you off to lie down on the floor, and placing himself above you. He then lowers his ass on your dick, and you're rewarded with his huge hard-on in plain sight, bouncing up and down as he's now riding you.";

The Dullahan milks your cock all the way to the last drop, but you're not the only one to reach an orgasm, as a thick blast of cream is shot in your direction, flying above your head and landing all over your body. There doesn't seem to be a near end to the horserider's load, as more and more of it seems to get pumped through his almost monster-sized meat, completely drenching you by his fifth shot. You're forced to close your eyes as it keeps flowing for a little while more, and then a chuckle invades your mind.";

'In fact I enjoy when a capable opponent can handle my strength.' You guess you'd see him winking if he had eyes to blink, but for now you'll have to take this information from the way he communicates with you. 'Now go. We have already spent enough time and I have my duties to attend to.' With this said, he grabs his loincloth and turns around, walking away. You're left drenched and sticky, and you have no choice but to return to your realm as well.";

Male in aspect, sporting a statuesque height and a helmet in the place of his head, the Dullahan is as strong as he is intimidating, making his victim's only hope to surrender immediately. He carries a greataxe made of human bones, ready to decapitate anyone who dares to cross his path. The only way to permanently kill a Dullahan is by finding his head and destroy it, however, doing so will release a vengeful wraith that will haunt his murderer for eternity.";

The tome is clear on how the Dullahan claims his victories, and sees sex as an act of domination or submission, depending on the end.
