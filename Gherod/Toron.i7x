Version 2 of Toron by Gherod begins here.

"Adds Toron, the bartender of the Hellfire Club, to the game."

[Version 1 - Moved Toron to his own file, as it was getting cramped in Mogdraz's file]
[Version 2 - Added Tentacular Slushie as a drink. Buffed some drink effects, adjusting negatives accordingly.]

It's confusing, and truth be told, you're not really sure about his real colors, only that he is far from being a human. He's tall within the average scale, and very muscular, with incredibly handsome features. However, he gives you this feeling of... uncertainty, like he's not what he really looks like, and the occasional scaly tentacle appearing right behind him to grab drinks and bottles out of his arms['] reach may help explain why you feel this way. He stands behind a counter all the time, though he's usually wearing some tight black jeans.";

Then, you're somehow feeling relaxed... and safe... your thoughts suddenly vanishing from your mind and... Wait, what just happened? You return to your senses and find yourself confused, frantically looking around as Toron laughs. 'It is a dangerous question, too. Gives me enough time to pluck a secret from you.'

'I am simply the bartender of the Hellfire Club, a loyal friend to Mogdraz... And someone whose bad side you don't want to be in. So... behave.' And those are the only things he says. Then, he's just staring at you with a sly smile, and his eyes are simply too irresistible to not stare back at... But remembering what happened just a while ago, it's probably for the best to not give in, else you want to accidentally let him know everything that is to know about you.

There's cum, girl juices, even milk sometimes - yes, tit milk, I'm not even kidding! - covering the floor at the corners they take for a quick fuck, and then it stinks! Imagine those dogs, cats, foxes, bulls, wolfs, bears, horses, gorillas, all fucking around for an entire night, and you can imagine the stench. Why is the demon kink so popular...? I don't get it. Are we that alluring?! And the sexual proposals I get...! And not just to suck me off or eat my ass, no, they are attracted to my tentacles! MY TENTACLES!' As he says this, he plops a big fat one on top of the counter. 'Who would want this in their beavers and tacos? Or slurp on this? It's just a scaly tentacle with suckers, like the ones octopuses have! Is this kinky?!'";

This ain't so bad, though I often wonder why Mogdraz has brought me here. I am a simple demon, who feeds on secrets. I may be able to provide you with some... gossip or actually useful information. Just ask, as long as you remain in the good guys['] list.' He seems to be some sort of informant, besides being a bartender.";

There aren't many I fancy... I like strong hands and beautiful eyes. Like Mogdraz's... yes, he's a good reference. We have our fun, sometimes, with his minions. Group sex is fun, but only during the day. At night, I'm stuck here, pouring drinks, serving them, and sweet talking customers into providing me knowledge.'

So your curiosity brings you to this question, specifically, what kind of relationship they maintain. Asking the bartender about it, he looks to the side and leans over the counter, speaking in a lower tone. 'I was our former Lord's informant. Right after his heir betrayed him and ran off, Mogdraz basically kidnapped me and made me work for him. I think I kind of let myself... uh... get fascinated by such a virile and powerful demon such as the Demon Lord of our world... and Mogdraz reminded me of him a lot without the bad parts, which was simply perfect. Mogdraz is one wholesome individual. He's not evil... nor corrupted... nor under the influence of Hell... unlike most of our kind. In a way, he freed me. And I am very thankful of that.'";
	say "     The informant of a Demon Lord?! Just how powerful are these demons... 'Very powerful, but in this world we are sort of limited, as the same laws do not apply. That might come to protect us in the end, who knows.' He replied to your... thought. Right, he can read your thoughts. 'Sorry about that. It's a bad habit.' he apologizes, 'But answering your initial question, my relationship with Mogdraz is... let's say we're close friends with benefits. And I'll let you know a little secret... He likes plushies. Says they're cuddly. It's kind of funny...' You thank him for what he shared, especially the last part, which is quite interesting, to say the least.";

to say ToronTalkXaedihr:
	say "     Now that Xaedihr is known around the club, you figure you could ask Toron if he knows him, too. 'Xaedihr... Yes, I know him well. Too well. I'm not sure if he's told you that, but he is the heir of the Demon Lord in our world. His only son, who saw his father falling into a deeper greed for power, and actually becoming powerful enough to defy Hell itself. Poor kid has seen things... He's not even fully demon, his mother was a human who died giving him birth, as his father is quite an unimaginably strong entity. Never shed a tear for his lover, he was more interested in training Xaedihr to become his successor, and even fused him with an aspect of darkness, leaving him with permanent marks. The tattoo on his shoulder and arm... That's it. And this aspect can be summoned at will, as he has mastered it. Otherwise, the aspect would have taken control of his mind, and possibly to become the Lord's underling. Quite sad if that were to happen.'";
	say "     Seems like Toron knows a lot more about Xaedihr than even the half-demon himself. 'You saw how he brought down two of Mogdraz's best hellfire demons so easily? You've got a powerful companion on your side... and with a very delicate heart. His tough shell is merely for self-protection. Gain his trust, and you'll have a friend for life, but hurt him, and you'll... be having a bad time.' You thank Toron for sharing this information with you, to which he nods. 'Just keep it discrete.'";

When you show the broken hilt to him, his eyes widen. 'You... You didn't do that, did you?!' he asks, and all you can say in response is... not denying the obvious. 'I really hope the seal is not that broken, then. If what you released from pulling that sword got out, it would be the end of the world... probably of all existence... I don't want to think about that. I believe it is imperative that we restore this sword and slay that creature at once! Do you have null essences?'

With your wiggling tongue, you lick his hole thorough before you make a bigger effort into pressing further inside, only to find out it just happens to welcome you so easily, yet so tightly, that you can caress all of his fleshy insides with ease. It almost feels like his ass is pulling your tongue, as hungry as he is, and it's not so long until Toron is moving his ass back and forth so he can feel you tonguefucking him deeper.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Putting your hands on each of his glutes, you twist and roll your tongue to the sides, while pushing it in and out as you go. Toron can barely hold his urge to moan, and you're sometimes able to hear a really low one, when nobody's nearby. Though enough is enough, you think, and pulling your tongue out of his hole, leaving it with a kiss, you figure it's time to use your hands, now that his anus has been prepared. Slowly, you press your index finger against his pucker, watching it being buried inside progressively as you keep pushing, causing the shapeshifting demon to let out a silent moan, the only audible part being a huff of desperate breathing, unable to hold his excitement. You're giving him hell during work, torturing him with pleasure, as he so much likes to feel his warm asshole filled up.";
	say "     Now having your finger fully inside, you add another as soon as you can, opening his blinking orifice even more, and yet it holds your fingers tightly. His moisty insides, however, provide you with some slipperiness that makes it easy for you to push them in and out, then you think that perhaps adding another to the two that are already inside would be what he needs. You're getting him really horny as you do this, and without being able to hold back any longer, he just blatantly grabs his dick and starts jerking off to the sensations that you're giving him, his asshole clenching around your fingers rather hard. Feeling him pushing his ass backwards, you shove in your fourth finger, leaving only your thumb out. He takes everything really eagerly, as deep as until your palm...";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     He humps his ass against your hand harder and harder, and you begin to feel that maybe your quartet of fingers isn't enough to satisfy his mega hungry butt, so without thinking too much about it, you begin to curl your thumb... then rub its tip across his stretched pucker... and slowly, it slips inside, as your entire hand follows. And he is effortlessly taking it all in, his ass welcoming your fist until past your carpal bones, reaching as far as your wrist... this guy can take it all! Now you're effectively fisting him as he jerks off, moaning intensely - though as low as he can, poor thing - while you bump into his prostate harder and harder. His ass nearly strangles your hand at some point, and as you feel his insides clenching around it, he says by almost whispering 'I'm gonna cum, fuuuck...!'";
	say "     You're able to feel his lower body work to shoot his load, and looking forward, you see him painting the lower side of the counter white with each powerful spurt of cum that goes increasingly harder, each shot resulting in a single ass clenching, which actually feels amazing around your fist and wrist, for a good while. You make sure you wiggle your hand as much as you can while inside him until his orgasm finally starts to subside, then you pull it out, observing his asshole retracting back to its original size, slowly closing in before your eyes. 'Oh, sweet fuck... Damn! I... hope you're around during the day...' he says, catching his breath and regaining his composure after such an intense climax. Curiously, your hand has no smell, even while being soaked in slimey juice, but it tastes really good.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With discretion, you leave by the side of the counter and back into the lounge area. You are under the impression that Mogdraz saw you sneak out of there, but even if he did, he doesn't seem to disapprove of that.";
	now lastfuck of Toron is turns;

to say ToronDayAssFuck:
	say "     Upon having decided what to do with Toron during his freetime, you simply head past the counter and grab him from behind, almost making him drop the glass. 'Whoa, careful...! Mogdraz will have my head if I break his things...' he says, although he doesn't stop you from putting your hands around his naked hips and brushing your growing [if player is not naked]bulge[else]exposed shaft[end if] against his ass cheeks. The bartender responds to your advances by placing down the glass and arching his back, so you can feel him pressing his rear against you, glancing at you over his shoulder while biting his underlip. 'You're gonna bend me over the counter and claim this ass right here? Give the boss a show?' he asks you, and it's hard to resist doing such right now. In fact, you feel the urge to do it as soon as he gives you that idea...";
	say "     Taking hold of him, you turn him around and push him against the bar counter, pushing his back forward and forcing him to bend over in front of you, his purple, gorgeous bubble butt pointing in your direction. He lets out a moan at the loud ass slap you give him as you get your hands on his glutes, feeling all the plumpness of his bubble cheeks under your palms before you start to spread them. Reaching closer, you [if player is not naked]whip out your [cock of player] dick[else]grab your [cock of player] dick[end if] and bring it over the space between his glutes, rubbing it across his perinium and over his donut hole. It's already feeling amazing against your shaft, and you can't wait to shove your cock inside him when you feel that moist hole winking hungrily at the sight of your manhood. Slowly, you being to press the tip against his orifice, only slightly as his entrance embraces your length as you thrust, burying it inside inch by inch as the slick walls of his insides pulse with desire.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Fuck... You feel so good in me...' he lets you know, moaning as you invade his ass, pushing more and more of your meat inside. You can't help but wonder if it's really okay to enjoy fucking the bartender with his boss eyeing you both from his corner, though his gaze is of interest, rather than contempt. 'Get it all in me... Please...' he begs you, and you're happy to oblige, pushing in every inch until the last. No matter how large your dick is, he takes it all, and the sensation is truly amazing. You really feel like he could take anything, all while making it feel so good and tight around your shaft. With just a little more pushing, your pelvis finally rests against his glutes, with only your balls remaining outside, and it almost feels like his ass is blowing your dick by how much it's clenching softly around your length. Grabbing Toron's wrists, you pull them and hold them against his lower back with one hand, while leaning yourself over on top of him, resting the other above the back of his head.";
	say "     The demon lets out a moan, as he begs you 'Ahh... Yes...! Please fuck me... Really hard...' The burst of sexual adrenaline fills you, and with one first long and hard pounding, you begin to fuck Toron with eagerness, following up with more deep thrusts where you can feel your entire length rubbing across his warm flesh tunnel. Building up the rhythm, you use your arms over him to support your weight as he gets pinned down with no other choice other than taking your cock as hard as you decide to fuck him, and you don't go easy on him. With all the action going on, you just feel like thrusting harder and deeper, pounding his ass like a battering ram, over and over like you own him.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Your powerful movements manage to make the wooden counter tremble with each thrust, glasses and bottles threating to fall over as your pounding gets more intense, and the demon can't help himself but to moan and grunt as you go. There's nothing stopping you from keeping on fucking the club's bartender, who's so eager at letting you claim his ass, for as long as your heart desires. Slipping your arm around his neck, you gently bite his ear, which sends Toron in a moaning frenzy, so excited by the way you're completely taking control over him. Things get so intense that, eventually, you feel yourself coming closer to the edge, and you can imagine that your demon bottom is feeling it too. You keep trusting deep, but slower, as you let him know that you're going to fill him up.";
	say "     He gasps, just enough to be able to say some encouraging words, such as 'Please...' and 'Breed me full of your spunk...!' in a breathy tone, as he's completely overtaken by the intensity of your assfucking. Within seconds, in your entire body surges a wave of pleasure and joy as your manhood begins to harden to his maximum, then throb with each hot shot of jizz being deposited inside the demon's ass. You continue to thrust and pound Toron until the very last spurt happens, coating his insides as he, too, delivers his own load on top of the counter, against which his own dick was rubbing all this time. 'Fuuuck... YES! Oh fuck...' he comes up with few words to describe what he's feeling right now, only trying to catch his breath as you slowly soften while still inside his hole.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     When it's time to pull out, only a single drop follows as you remove your shaft from his hole, and it feels like his butt just slurped up everything that you've given him. 'That... that was a good feeding... my ass is pleased, and so am I... W-were we too noisy?' he asks, looking over you, then over to Mogdraz, who's still sitting by his sofa in his usual corner, who looks back at you for a few seconds, with something bulging and rather large between his legs. Then he gives a chuckle and continues on talking to one of his servants. 'Oh... Looks like he really was watching us... Well, me, getting... you know... Fuck, That was hot.' says Toron to you, while he gets set on cleaning the mess that he made all over the counter. 'I'm down to do this again, if you are... When I... uh, have time.'";
