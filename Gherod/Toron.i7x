"Adds Toron, the bartender of the Hellfire Club, to the game."

[Version 1 - Moved Toron to his own file, as it was getting cramped in Mogdraz's file]
[Version 2 - Added Tentacular Slushie as a drink. Buffed some drink effects, adjusting negatives accordingly.]
[Version 3 . Added the Tonics.]

He also has no shadow of his own, which is quite odd. He is tall within the average scale and fairly slim, though you can see quite a lean form that looks attractive to the eye, with an incredibly handsome face that lures your gaze into infinity. However, he gives you this feeling of... uncertainty, like he isn't what he really looks like, and the occasional shadowy tentacle appearing right behind him to grab drinks and bottles out of his arms['] reach may help explain why you feel this way. He stands behind a counter all the time, but when he's not, you can see he wears tight leather pants.";

Imagine those dogs, cats, foxes, bulls, wolfs, bears, horses, gorillas, all fucking around for an entire night, and you can imagine the stench. Why is the demon kink so popular...? I don't get it. Are we that alluring?! And the sexual proposals I get...! And not just to suck me off or eat my ass, no, they are attracted to my tentacles! MY TENTACLES!'

His only son, who saw his father falling into a deeper greed for power, and actually becoming powerful enough to defy Hell itself. Poor kid has seen things... He's not even fully demon, his mother was a human who died giving him birth, as his father is quite an unimaginably strong entity. Never shed a tear for his lover, he was more interested in training Xaedihr to become his successor, and even fused him with an aspect of darkness, leaving him with permanent marks. The tattoo on his shoulder and arm... That's it. And this aspect can be summoned at will, as he has mastered it. Otherwise, the aspect would have taken control of his mind, and possibly to become the Lord's underling. Quite sad if that were to happen.'";

You duck behind the counter so nobody can see you quietly approaching the bartender, who is actually not wearing anything from his waist down, something that is impossible to observe from the other side of the counter. Occasionally, a shadowy tentacle can be seen taking form from his back, stretching towards a distant bottle or some other ingredient, though he maintains a pair of completely normal humanoid legs to sustain his weight, and with that, a magnificent bubblebutt waiting to get grabbed by you. As you take some time to admire his dark glutes, a soft, warm tendril brushes against the back of your head, encouraging you to lean closer...";

His black skin is really soft, and his buttcheeks are so plump and bubbly that you could just stay here feeling them up for hours... and for just a second, Toron seems briefly distracted by your touch, showing signs of arousal, before he returns to his usual expression while serving drinks. You don't want to rush anything here, so first, you feel up his ass cheeks some more, because they feel really good on your palms, bouncing nicely and firmly with each movement he makes. The bartender archs his back a little, letting you take a better look at his pucker. It's shaped like a plump and soft donut hole, twitching along with your touch, looking so inviting that it sends your heart into a fast, eager beat.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As you are getting acquainted with his marvelous butt, each plump glute clenching and bouncing with your caressing, you slide in a single finger right between his cheeks to feel that warm and accomodating hole, feeling almost too silky.

It feels amazing just rubbing his anus, it's incredibly warm and welcoming, and a plethora of ideas just pop up in your mind... Only if you could do anything you wanted to his ass right here, right now... Though perhaps you can give it a good lick. His tentacle keeps pushing your head from behind, which is a clear invitation to this.";

'A[one of] Hellfire Swea... Uh, excuse me... Swizzle[or] Black Ch...' - he breathes... - Cherry Drink[or] Tequila S-shot[or] S-simple... Beer [or] most refined Red Wine C-[or] Black Lemon Lime Voooh-' - he clears his throat to mask that accident - 'Vodka[at random] coming out...!' he says to the client amidst a moan you have caused, and lucky him that his tentacles are able to do the work. With your wiggling tongue, you lick his hole thorough before you make a bigger effort into pressing further inside, only to find out it just happens to welcome you so easily, yet so tightly, that you can caress all of his fleshy insides with ease.

Eventually, his tentacles pull out, and you are allowed to take a whiff of fresh air and catch your breath. Another of his tentacles raises your hand in the form of a suggestion, and looking at his hole, it seems to wink at you while... You are not sure, but his butt seems even larger than before. He invites you to touch it once more, your fingers moving closer to his pucker... and then, you find your index finger sinking inside his ass very easily, welcomed by his warm fleshy tunnel.";

His moisty insides, however, provide you with some slipperiness that makes it easy for you to push them in and out, then you think that perhaps adding another to the two that are already inside would be what he wants. With his asshole clenching around your fingers rather hard, you feel him pushing his ass backwards as you shove in your fourth finger, leaving only your thumb out.

And he is effortlessly taking it all in, his ass welcoming your fist until past your carpal bones, reaching as far as your wrist... And after impaling himself on your arm, you feel a cluster of tentacles surrounding you, stroking and rubbing at you from every angle into every sensitive area of yours as you continue to effectively fist him.

And it is not satisfied yet, you feel him try to pull more of it, clenching around your arm so hungrily that you find it appropriate to move it around and thrust inwards in order to sate it.

Your mind is a soothing place... and you're not so bad with your tongue. Hit me up for more next time.' he says, as he taps your hip - this time with his hand - with a demonic grin.
