			say "     Seeing this almost fascinating, yet intimidating, large and strong lizardman, you opt to drop your stance and surrender. He seems suspicious of this at first, and that does not seem to change even after brief moments. As you offer no further resistance, the reptilian charges at you and pushes you to the ground, following this by mounting your torso and keep you immobilized with his weight and legs on each side of your body. With that done, he then plunges his quarterstaff into the dirt and holds onto it, looking down at you with clear distrust. 'You are intruding in our territory. These grounds belong to us, so I recommend you a hasty retreat.'";

			say "     With one final blow, this large and strong lizardman manages to placate you and cause you to collapse on the ground. With inhuman agility, he quickly mounts your torso and keeps you immobilized with his weight and legs on each side of your body. With that done he then plunges his quarterstaff into the dirt and holds onto it, looking down at you with clear distrust. 'You are intruding in our territory. These grounds belong to us, so I recommend you a hasty retreat.'";
		say "     Moving does not seem to be an option, and you find yourself simply at the lizardman's mercy as he stares at you in the eyes. His loincloth barely covers anything from your perspective, as the way he moved into this position led the cloth to curve in a way that reveals his crotch, there being a slit from where you suppose his member would poke out. As you cannot really move, you simply look back at the big reptilian with pleading eyes. 'It is utterly disrespectful to invade someone's home uninvited. And as you are so lacking in manners, I feel I must discipline you.' Your eyes shift away from his and into the slit on his crotch, where his slick red meat begins to show itself and grow forward.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'I shall teach you the virtue of selflessness,' he says as he puts his loincloth to the side, fully revealing his throbbing reptilian cock right in front of your face, 'One that will serve you for a lifetime. 'You must learn to be considerate. I shall let you go only once you bring me to a bliss.' Staying where he is, the reptilian simply lets his erection take full shape, and due to his huge size, it is not so strange that his cock looks equally sizable. You can measure it by eye for roughly a few inches above a foot of length, and it is particularly girthy the more it goes towards the base. This hung lizardman then loosens the grip he has on you with his legs and allows you to move your arms above them, though as soon as you do that, he tightens them around you once more.";
		say "     It appears you must do as he says to earn your freedom, as he is not letting you go so easily. His intimidating cerulean gaze and throbbing cock is all you see from your perspective, and he does nothing else other than stare back at you, waiting for your move. Since he seems to want you to take initiative in providing him [']selfless pleasure['], you see that your best option is to get to work. Respectfully, you bring both your hands around his shaft, which throbs in response as he lets out a grunt of approval, but no additional words, only a nod. Gently, you begin to rub your palms against that huge member of his, from the base to the that pointy tip, and he finally lets go of his fixated gaze, ocassionally closing his eyes and enjoying the sensations.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     When he begins to moan, you figure it is time to pick up the pace and stroke him faster, to lead him closer to that edging point that will grant you your freedom. But, as soon as you do it faster than you should, the lizardman stops you by grabbing your wrist and forcing you to take it slower. 'Patience is also a virtue you should practice,' he says, and you feel his cock throbbing way more once you go back at doing it slowly, just as he wants you to. He only lets go of your hand once he sees you are back to a rhythm that satisfies him, and actively observes you during the following moments. You do your best at stroking his big shaft, moving your hands across its entire length, from the base to the tip, in slow but steady motions.";
		say "     This time, you slowly increase the pace, in a way that feels more natural to his own movements, as you do feel him sort of thrusting into your hands after a while. You let him take the lead on how fast you go, and in this way, you manage to get him quite excited in a manner of minutes. Although, at one point, the large reptilian moves his hands over your head, which prompts you to stop, and as you think you have done something wrong again, you feel him shifting his position to one closer to your face. His huge cock is now erect right above your features, and he then leads it over to your lips, pushing it against them. Before you can give him a questioning look, he continues to shove his cock into your mouth as his scales begin to glow, flaring up in a pattern that leaves you fascinated the more you continue to stare... 'You make a good pupil. Here's some further encouragement...'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     You feel a sense of calm and peace as these colors lit up one after the other, to a point you instinctively begin to feel that tasting this large reptilian penis is not so bad at all. Almost as a reflex, you open wide and give him entry, as several inches of his manhood make their way into your mouth. He is nice enough to slide both his hands under your skull, giving you all the support you need to comfortably suck on his big dick, even if you jaw has to strain itself to accomodate the increasing girth. Most of what you can do is wiggle your tongue around all that meat, something the lizardman seems to appreciate as he grunts approvingly. Then, he just moves your head back and forth, your lips sliding along his shaft, as he gives a few slight complementary thrusts.";
		say "     Despite his rather massive size, the lizardman is quite gentle and careful with his movements, caring mostly about the pleasure that can be achieved from this. He seems to appreciate your slow worship more than anything, taking care of how he moves your head so that he feels that tongue of yours in all the right sensitive spots. You mostly focus your wiggling on the tip, which seems to be what he enjoys the most as he leaks when you do it, and his precum appears to have a taste reminiscent of a sweet lemonade. You have a quite easy time during all this as the sizable reptilian decides to not fuck your throat, even as he goes deep in there at times, it is not enough to make you choke on it, added to the fact this whole light show feels oddly relaxing to you, as if it was mystical in nature.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Oh, you've almost done it... Don't stop now...' he moans, especially when you focus your tongue movements just below those pointy glans, wiggling it in quick circles. He breathes deeply as he seems to be enduring the growing pleasure surging within him, and suddenly, you feel his cock throb intensely before a stream of creamy seed begins to fill your mouth. As it pulsates so hard, his cock pops out of your mouth on its own and begins to shoot everywhere, or at least it feels like it from your perspective, as cum flies above you and lands all over your face. For a good while, the lizardman only moans, right until the very last drops of his long and abundant climax.";
		say "     'Yess...! You've done it, brought me to a bliss as it was your goal. This means you've earned your freedom,' he says, only now standing up and leaving your body free of any leg grappling. He picks up his quarterstaff and says a few additional words before walking away, 'You're welcome to keep intruding upon our territory, if you so wish. I'm certain my brothers will be as glad to teach you a few more lessons.' You catch a grin on his lizard-like face before he turns away and leaves you alone, your face covered in his still warm spunk. You have nothing else to do but to stand on your feet and clean yourself up before returning to your own doings.";

If you follow me, you can see it with your own eyes the great power of our leader.' Your interest continues to be picked the more the lizardman talks about this mysterious persona, who apparently even possesses mystic powers. Without any further ado, you nod and beckon the scaly beastman to take the lead, as you shall follow behind. 'I'm glad you've accepted to come. Through here, just across this glade.

Otherwise, your memories of it will fade into the vacuum of void, never to return. Though, give my people a chance. You'll see we're more than meets the mortal eye.' Given the serenity of this place and all the mysticism behind his claims, you doubt he is lying.

I've found this great warrior and can vouch for [PosPro] skills, personally.' He immediately inspects you, looking over you from head to feet with clear interest. 'Is that so...? How quaint.

'My, fascinating find! My name is Sevik, and I'm the Prince of this tribe, second to none other but God Uzial, whom you shall be meeting soon. However, you cannot go meet Him in your current conditions! You stink.' He was direct, but truthful, as the stench of wilderness is very present in you, while he seems to smell of flowers.";

We can be in relative privacy there, as I sympathize that bathing in public might come as a shock for beginners.' This stranger lizardman is asking you to bathe in his tent, and while that would not be necessarily unpleasant, it is a sensible request. These people have costumes and habits that you would have to adapt to, as you are expected to, and you believe it is going to be hard to avoid potentially embarrassing situations.

There are certain sections of the tent that are separated with a cloth, and your next destination is one of those. You are met with a large bathtub, already filled with clean heated water, and plenty of petals are floating about. It smells great, clean and fresh, and is extremely inviting right off the bat.

You see no reason to refuse his request, now that you are here, anyway. So, you ensure your own nakedness as well, dropping your stuff on the spot Sevik showed you.

Once Sevik gets his scales wet, you realize how much their scales actually glow, as if the water was an activator. This only accentuates their beauty, as he basically turns your surroundings, along with the movement of the water, into something close to a light show.";

Then I suppose you'll want to leave, eventually... That's why you need to speak with Uzial. Hm...' He leans back, deep in thought, his muscles and glowing scaled glistening as he places his arms on top of the large bathtub's edges. 'If you plan to leave, you'll need His blessing.

Your chances are good unless you fuck up massively, in which case I'll bid you goodbye with sad disappointment. I hope that doesn't happen, for the sake of a better... closer relationship.' He then leans closer to you, but only slightly, making eye contact with you in a rather suggestive way, those cerulean blue irises of his glowing into your gaze like little enticing stars.";
			say "     'I can tell you're no ordinary person, so I'm quite confident you'll be allowed to stay. For now, enjoy these waters for a little while longer... You'll feel like new.' Indeed, what he says about this bath is true. You hardly ever had an experience as relaxing as this, to the point you nearly fall asleep while enjoying the warmth and sweet scents. However, after a few minutes, it is cut short by Sevik himself, who gets up nonchalantly, makes himself quite visible in your line of sight, looks at you as you fully reopen your eyes, and slowly gets out of the bathtub. 'It's time for us to go,' he says, extending his hand towards you from outside. 'I know you'd like to stay for longer, but we should make haste before someone is sent here to question your prolonged presence.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     With those words, you too begin to get out of the bath. Sevik is already there holding a towel in his hands for you to grab, and you use it to dry yourself. It is surprisingly soft, and after that, your entire body feels soft and even slightly sensitive, in an amazing way... 'Now you're smelling good and looking way better than when you first arrived. There's no way God Uzial won't take you in with open arms. Come now, let's go.' You haven't even gotten dressed yet, and you tell him that, to which he responds 'Oh, but my dear, that's the goal. He must find you pleasing to look at... And what better way is there to show yourself off than heading inside in your birthday suit?' You only now realize what this is all about. This god of theirs wants to see if they find you... attractive.";
			say "     Well, it is not like you can pull back from your decision now, so you simply decide to go along and allow the lizardman to lead you to the large temple you saw first upon entering the camp. During your way there, all the local lizardmen lay their eyes on you with visible lust. You even try to find one who does not pay attention to you, but every single one of them does, and all with the same kind of interest. Facing this awkward situation, you ask Sevik what is going on, given that every eye is on you at the moment. 'Oh, that just means it's working. Consider yourself lucky to have me on your side, or you would have been absolutely ravaged by now... Well, maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing for yourself, but that's now what we're here for. Plenty of time to have fun later...!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You cannot help but feel like you are being played with, but again, there does not seem to be a point in lingering on that thought. Your way to the temple feels longer than it would otherwise be with the preoccupation occupying your mind as it is, but once you enter, there is only silence and a corridor, followed by an enormous door. Sevik simply walks up to it and presses his hand over the handle, and without even making a gesture, the door opens on its own, slowly and heavily. You both wait for it to fully reveal the next room in anticipation for what is about to come. Curiosity intensifies at every second you keep waiting, and as you turn to the lizardman about to ask something, he brings one finger over his mouth in a request for silence.";
			say "     Finally, the way ahead of you is free, so you walk inside with Sevik and... You cannot believe your eyes. What you see is yet another lizardman, but of gigantic proportions, sitting on an equally enormous throne, wearing nothing but golden jewelry adorning his limbs, torso and the very top of his head. This oversized jewelry consists of mostly golden chains, amulets and huge colorful gemstones that are extremely eyecatching, looking almost as radiant as his glowing skins of various colors. As the room is not very illuminated, only by some torches scattered through the side walls and corners, this light show is greatly visible and almost hypnotic, way more than any of the common lizardmen you have seen. Just looking at him is an experience, as your mind struggles to truly comprehend his magnificence with your eyes alone.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'How's it going, Uzi? Had many visitors today?' You immediately turn to Sevik, shocked that he dropped all the formalities regarding this huge lizardman being a god, and frankly, quite confused. He also chuckles once he sees the expression you are making. 'Sevik. I assume this is your... new acquaintance?' the enormous reptilian asks, leaning forward slightly as he fixates his gaze on you. 'Indeed [SubjectPro] is. I took the freedom to prepare [ObjectPro] for the visit,' the lizardman next to you says as he then beckons you to step forward towards the giant. 'How interesting... So you've found this place? Or were you brought by any of my men?' the god asks, and you reply explaining how you came to be here.";
			say "     'Ah, you're an explorer who happened to fight one of us, and they felt compelled to show you where we live in hopes to forge an alliance with an outside. My... I have to commend his initiative. Perhaps a full day on my lap offering me worship... Though it is you I'm interested in at the moment. Why did Sevik take such interest in you as well?' You, quite frankly, have no idea. You did not even know they were so acquainted, to the point of addressing each other with no formalities attached. 'Sevik and I were dating back in the time before the apocalypse. We're on an open relationship. I assume he hasn't told you this?' Sevik coughs an excuse, 'Well, you see, I had to put up an act so this would seem more... credible to the others, right? But yes, that's true. I merely intended to ask Uzi to keep you around.'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Earning Sevik's favor is way harder than earning mine. If he approves of you, so do I,' declares Uzial as he leans back against his throne. 'You shall address me as a God outside of these walls or in presence of any other lizardman, and Sevik as Lord Prince. You may also return whenever you wish, and any companion you bring along is welcome as long as they remain loyal to you. And if you're wondering...' he pauses for a few seconds, looking intensely at you, 'No, I'm not a god, nor is Sevik a prince. But these lizardmen believe we are, and we don't think they're from our timeline. This is necessary to keep order. In any case, any question you may have, you can simply come to me and I'll explain. Now, I have my business to attend to, so allow me to simply sprinkle some magic onto you.'";
			say "     There are so many questions lingering in your mind that you do not know even when to start, but Uzial just leans over towards you and presses your forehead with his large thumb. His enormous size makes you flinch at first, but once his magic washes over you, you feel more centered. 'Sevik, please take [ObjectPro] with you and address any questions [SubjectPro] may have, for the time being. I'll be busy providing the escort of our newcomer a well-deserved reward.' Sevik smirks and winks at his giant lover, then proceeds to lead you outside.";

And don't worry about the other lizardmen around here, the aphrodisiac should've worn off by now.' That... Explains it. Well, at least one question is out of the way. For now, you are left at the entrance of this enormous temple as Sevik heads back to his humble abode on his own. This was certainly something else... There is a lot about this place and tribe that you do not yet know or understand, but at least their leaders seem to have you in good consideration.";
