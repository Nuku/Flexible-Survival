Relative to some of the other builidngs you've seen, this one looks much more worn down, with smashed furniture strewn about and gaping holes in the walls revealing the skeletal piping, mangled beyond repair.

You carefully peak over your concealment to see just what you're dealing with. A large, powerful-looking, male wolf steps out into the street, followed closely by a female cheetah. Neither are wearing clothes, and the cheetah is tethered to the wolf by a leash and collar. The wolf pulls harshly at the leash, much to the felines chagrin as she yelps and stumbles after him.";

'Wait,' she hisses, catching you off guard. 'I... I know him too.' You look at her expectantly, silently asking the obvious question. She does nothing to hide the disgust in her voice as she utters his name. 'Reese. That bastard.' She snarls as forgotten memories begin to return to her.";

'Ah,' he says, tugging on the leash again. 'So that bitch you used to call a friend finally has the courage to show her face around here again.' He looks up from the cheetah to address Katherine directly. 'Things are different this time, bitch,' he spits the word at her with vitriol. 'I've been waiting for a good opportunity to dish out some payback. And this new body is gonna make short work of you.' He flexes the powerful, rippling muscles of his alpha wolf form, showing off as he readies for a fight.";

You almost think he's going to put up a fight regardless, and with his powerful infection, he might actually stand a chance. But just then, a feral wyvern swoops in from overhead, breaking apart the stand-off. You dive for cover as it narrowly misses you with a glob of goo. Katherine isn't so lucky. She doesn't take a direct hit, but it's enough to bog her down and take her out of the fight. The wyvern turns its predatory eyes on her, but you draw it's attention to yourself instead. You see Reese take advantage of the opportunity to disengage, dragging Lauren behind him as he makes a break for it.

'Thanks Alpha,' she says to you as she finally pulls her left foot free.

She huffs at you, feeling more than capable of taking care of herself, but relents to her alpha as you guide her under one of the showerheads. You turn on the water, and she yips and shivers at the cold flow of water now running through her fur. It just won't do to have your bitch uncomfortably cold, so you strip off your clothes and join her, rubbing her down to begin warming her up.";

The remaining wyvern groop falls to the floor, harmlessly spinning away down the drain. While hesitant at first, your German shepherd begins to enjoy the luxurious treatment, allowing you to massage her body under the flowing water. Soon, your hands switch from firm scrubbing to lewd groping, and she eagerly returns the favor, tracing her paws along the curves of your body and tickling your skin with the tips of her claws.";

She brings her lips to your own and kisses you deeply. When she pulls back, she says, 'I can't take it anymore!' She turns away from you and firmly plants her hands on the shower wall, raising her tail to present you with her dripping pussy. 'Fuck me, Alpha!'";

Despite their smaller size, Katherine's breasts are squished out to the side from the force of it all, and her cheek is pressed up against the wet tile as she moans in pleasure. You hold yourself inside her, enjoying the feel of her clamping down on you and her tail writhing with joy, trapped between your bodies. Gripping her tightly with one hand on her hips and one on her head, you slowly withdraw. You slam into her again, and she utters something like a mix between a growl and a bark.";
			say "     You repeat the process again and again, and each time the shepherd barks in excitement. Soon you've worked up a pace of fierce, frenzied fucking, with your bitch moaning and barking your name. 'Yes Alpha. Harder. Harder!' she screams. Like a good Alpha, you give her what she wants. You reach around to grab her breasts and bite down on her neck from behind. Fucking your bitch after proving your worth in a fight, you feel absolutely invincible. With your bodies so in tune, you climax together, and you pump your German shepherd full of cum as her muscles milk you for everything you're worth.";

You pull out from her tight tunnel, and your [cum load size of player] load slips down her legs. The running water from the shower quickly cleans away the traces of your romp, and you each give yourselves another rinse before shutting off the water.

The rhythmic throbbing of its cock against your body feels decadently lewd. Most of its cum lands harmlessly on the street, but both your face and Katherine's are spattered by stray splashes.

You scramble backwards a bit as the wyvern approaches, intent on having it's way with you. But just as it's about to grab you in it's maw, a shout from Katherine catches its attention.
