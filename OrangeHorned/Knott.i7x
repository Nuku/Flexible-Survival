to say Knottdesc:
	say "     The former terra-cotta skinned priest shyly stands around 7 feet, his clothes are what you imagine what some male stripper in a priest getup would use at a burlesque show- hugging onto this masculine body to accentuate the changes. You see a blue colored blanket wrapped around his crotch to at least 'try' to keep his bulge hidden, yet the python still manages to peek out when he shuffles his feet. He sees you looking at his unkempt shoulder length hair, giving a grunt of annoyance as his mostly more human kept face presses into a pout, their bovine ears drooping. The last thing you can see of note is a colorful rosary just above their collarbone.";

Scent of Knott is "Knott smells like  the inside of some antique store mixed with some earthy hints, the best way to describe it is some church mixed with some herbal spring. Oddly enough those two conflicting things actually go well to him.". [How the character smells. Can be detailed or not.]

to say KnottTalk1: [The actual scene the talk menu points to!]
	say "     The former older man seems to confusingly look at you, he carefully knits to himself with his satchel next to him- all while he keeps another eye on Giving. 'I'll keep it brief, honestly I've always been a man who would rather speak with his actions or grand speech than very basic small talk, Giving told me my new nickname Knott considering I was once a marriage priest, but I had... other urges that I had to attend to. Was visiting this place for a funeral when the whole... what did those young ones call it, the 'furry apocalypse' happened'.";
	say "     With a palm through his new hair, he continued, 'Part of me was always interested in what was causing all those people to go insane, now I get it, this fresh feeling of old vitality coming back to me, no back pain, I feel great, like the man I was almost 50 years ago- and I know this time it ain't my brain failing me!'";

to say KnottTalk2:
	say "     'Mostly probably doing what God possibly intended me to do, these people here need guidance, someone to talk to about all that ails them, they welcomed me with open arms, so they should only expect any who have walked the path of righteousness to help them out.' You ask a side question on what caused them to give up the priest's life, Knott's face lightens up as he tries to hide his humane impulse, 'I do not wish to speak of it, especially not right now in this given time, I just.... It comes with its own baggage you see? When I get more comfortable here maybe ill be in the mood for such gab.'";

to say KnottTalk3:
	say "     You ask him about he stuff he possibly left back at where he called safe haven before becoming a Firbolg, 'You would do that for a old man like me? I mean...' He gives you a look before pausing a bit... finally pursing his lips before continuing, 'This wont be a easy journey, there's something we were trying to run from there, some people in this... city... have given into the most rabid of hedonisms. I doubt any you saw running with me went back there after the infected ferals routed us, but if you do go back... I had a book there that I was reading... if you could grab it for me, I would be forever in your debt.'";

to say KnottTalk4:
	say "     you pull out the book you found from the High Rise District 'This book ... .I left it in one of the last places I went when I was still human. I have no clue what process you might have been through to get this, but I thank you.'";
	say "     You give him the details on what happened when you went to grab the book, about Travis and his little band of lunatics.";
	say "     'I sadly do not know anything about this Travis you speak of, but the kid sounds familiar, him and his mom weren't bad company... Do not blame yourself wholly for not being able to do anything for them. You went into this to help me out and I thank you deeply. That's what worries me the most of just opening myself up to such things. These thoughts within my head yearn for me to spread my lusts onto the wind.'";
	say "     He takes a deep pause, realizing another certain Firbolg was peeking behind a tree at your conversation, 'Giving asked you to do this for me, that much I know. The way this camp is set up makes me wish to push these lustful desires into something more constructive. So if you wish, I can try getting to know you a little more personally through the rubbing of skin.'";
	say "     Wow, that was easier than expected";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'I wasn't just being prudish, more trying to isolate myself from others, but with how abrasive Giving can be, I can tell he is just trying deeply to help out even if he needs to let people come to their own conclusions. He warned me about needing to partake in the 'sermons' they have to placate our passions together, but I for one can not stand the idea of such a pagan ritual, but if I come at it with the mindset of lowering the chances of doing these... horrid actions the intrusive thoughts would drag me to do, then I can bare it. Sangre seems to be someone who has much on his hands anyway to be the odd nail out in this new group.'";
	say "     Happily, he puts the book neatly under his robe's belt, something about his expression grew softer.";
	say "     'Now Giving, come out.'";
	say "     'Wha- was it obvious?'";
	say "     'Your build is not one meant for lurking, but I will be joining you more now, next time though don't send people to do work that both of us could do together my child.'";
	say "     Giving's chuckle of embarrassment restores a bit of hope you have in this apocalypse, you hope things get better for the commune.";

to say KnottSex1: [Vaginal]
	say "     You ask him to sink his cock into your pussy, and not to worry if he stretches you out a bit; the nanites should fix it anyway. He grins at your request. 'In the mood for something vigorous, are you? Well, I think that I can oblige,' he replies. 'I hope that you won't mind if I take charge for this,' he continues. The moment you consent, he pushes you to the ground with your groin high in the air, vulgar and inviting. He takes a moment to appreciate it before he slides his bulky fingers past your labia and twists them in an exquisite manner. 'I will admit, I've only done this with Giving a few times, so my apologies if my technique is a little rusty,' Knott informs you. You don't even need to reply properly, a lustful purr signaling your enjoyment as his middle finger stimulates at the edges of your nether lips, quickly testing out the depth.";
	say "     It doesn't take long for your pussy to slicken enough for a second finger to be added, the friction of his knuckles brushing over your clit stimulating more juices of arousal. Despite his claims of inexperience, Knott seems to know exactly how to use his fingers, acclimating your vagina to his touch before advancing deeper. It isn't just the penetration either, as his other hand caresses over your body, stroking your tummy, tweaking your nipples, and teasing [if player is Male]your cock[else]your groin[end if]. All in all, it is far more affection than the majority of creatures in the city would provide you with. 'Tell me if you want me to speed up or slow down. Everyone is different after all,' the firbolg tells you. Looking at him, you are reminded of how gentle he is despite his size and you are sure that he'll be just as attentive once he has you speared on his cock.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Thanks to the nanites spreading from him, your cunt no matter the size is able to able to take such a large shaft. Knott quickly throwing his head back as he takes pace with pounding away at your [CockSpeciesName of Player in lower case] pussy, 'oh.... [if Player is not defaultnamed][Name of Player][else]please[end if] take my young...' a low moan bellows from his throat from all the pleasure coursing through his body, giving into what the nanites have been possibly telling him to do constantly. Its only a amazement he could last against such a seductive song for so long when every push and tug of his cock in you is spraying hot pre all over your fertile depths.";
	say "     You can't hold for much longer, quickly you start squirting hot femcum all over the place[if player is Male], your cock following after with alabaster cum spraying the floor[end if] and a few thrusts later your tryst companion reaches his own limit, balls flexing intensely before sending large batches of virile cum straight to your womb. His body lays on top of you- warmly caressing you as both of you take time to recover... his cock still standing hard as ever deep inside. With his sweat getting all over you, your vitality slowly returns to you after a while.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'You're enjoyable to be inside... do come back sometime on your adventures, my cock can have a mind of its own...' your cunt trembles at the thought of him inside of you again, you may have been infected with Beag nanites, but you know you would love to do it again.";

to say KnottSex2: [Anal]
	say "     You tell him that you want to feel his cock in your ass. 'Is that so? I think that I can accommodate such a request, but don't blame me if you can't sit quite as comfortably afterwards,' Knott chuckles. 'Leave yourself in my capable hands and I promise that you won't regret it. Now, if you wouldn't mind bending over and I'll try to prepare you a bit before we get to the main course,' he suggests. You obey without hesitation, presenting yourself to him, even spreading your buttocks apart to give him an unsurpassed view of his objective. He spends several seconds drinking in the sight before him before stepping up to you and caressing a hand over your flank and briefly rubbing his fingers against your hole. 'Can't say that I'm particularly experienced with this, but hopefully you'll enjoy my learning experience too. The reward will certainly be worth it,' Knott grins, feeling the give of your pucker before bringing his hand away again.";
	say "     'I regret that I don't have any proper lubricant for this, so we'll have to make do with saliva,' the firbolg apologizes. 'Don't worry, there shouldn't be any risk of transformation. If there was, I'm sure that semen would be worse.' He quickly sucks a couple of his fingers to slicken them before sliding them against your anus. Starting with one finger, he slips it inside and you feel the walls of your ass squeeze and constrict around it as it gently burrows deeper. 'You don't seem to be having much trouble with that, maybe this will be easier than I thought.'";
	say "     Knott comments, pressing a second finger in alongside the first, steadily thrusting them in and out to stretch and lubricate you. You can feel how careful he is being, unnecessary as it seems to be, but if it makes him feel better, you're happy to be patient. It's strangely comforting that he is so focused on your wellbeing when so many in the city wouldn't have even thought twice before mounting you and going in dry. Fortunately the nanites seem to adapt for that, but this... this is nice too.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Such niceness is only coupled to the fact that the said man your banging is also still a big fella who is ready to turn you with your ass above your head as your pinned to the ground with your legs above you. Knott quickly moves ontop of you to get in position before pushing himself into the slightly lubed hole, quickly getting a moan from both of you as his large shaft hits your prostate. With a few more guiding thrusts, your hole vibrates with nanites as the Firbolgs sweaty body begins to make you feel all giddy as the pain that should be there is only making you want to cum hard.";
	say "     Your new mate bucks deep into you while your in a trance, both of you frantically breathing as you silently chase your orgasms, Knott fervently holds your [bodySpeciesName of Player] body sensually, caressing the curves as he leans over to look you in the face. With a few more tugs you feel a rush of cum flowing from the base of his shaft all the way to your belly- quickly expanding it from the volume before spilling back out. Knott's tongue hangs out as he holds onto your body for support.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'You're enjoyable to be inside... do come back sometime on your adventures, my cock can have a mind of its own...' your ass gets tingly when he motions to his meat, you may have been infected with Beag nanites, but you know you would love to do it again.";
