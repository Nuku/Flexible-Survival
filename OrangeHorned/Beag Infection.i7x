As he grinds his long appendage against your pussy's wet lips- making you moan to the flared tip- your needy cunt suddenly feels empty after a long fought battle, and he's unfortunately got what you need. With an arrogant snort, the bovine-man taunts you. 'Ooooh I've been waiting for this, when I'm finished you're gonna beg to be one of my brothers!' he says, rubbing a thick hand across your tummy. Before you can respond, he slams his groin into your rear, laying you out onto the ground as he shifts his position enough to get his penis lined up and drives his foot-long erection into you, drawing another moan from your trembling body.";
			say "     As he mates you, he tries muffling his moans and moos into your neck. Your inner walls quiver and your honeyed juices start to flow as your excitement builds. Your vagina squeezes and pulls at his meaty rod and, after several minutes of steady pounding, is rewarded with the hot rush of the beag's semen. As he climaxes with a loud bull's call he loses his rhythm, blasting spurt after spurt of thick semen into you. Once spent, he rubs your belly meaningfully once again before pulling out. 'See you on the flip side doll,' leaving you panting and leaking his tainted seed as he vanishes into the crazed city.";
		else:
			say "     He roughly turns you over onto all fours and climbs atop you, sinking his horse-like dong into your pussy. You moan and quickly grow a desperate need to feel his hot cum. Your inner walls quiver and your honeyed juices start to flow as your excitement builds. After a few minutes of steady pounding, he drives hard into you repeatedly, blasting spurt after spurt of thick semen into you. Even as you're cumming, he pushes you off his spent cock and onto the ground before leaving you splayed out on the ground.";

		say "     He roughly turns you over onto all fours and grabs your ass. 'You got no breeding hole, but you'll do nicely, my balls are aching for release,' he says as he climbs atop you, sinking his flared cock into your ass. You groan in discomfort at the sudden penetration, but quickly grow excited as the sweat from his body makes your skin tingle with energy- making every thrust more pleasurable than the last. He grunts into your shoulder, and after a few minutes of steady pounding, he finally loses himself to pleasure- blasting spurt after spurt of thick semen into your ass. Even as you're cumming, he pushes you off his spent cock and onto the ground before sauntering off.";
		CreatureSexAftermath "Player" receives "AssFuck" from "Beag";
	else:
		say "     'Eh, no hole, no goal. Come find me when you get a cunt. Then I'll properly breed you,' he grunts as he walks off in dissatisfaction.";

to say beatthebeag:
	say "     The beag falls on his ass as he takes a few steps back. 'Ok ok you made your point, but help a guy out, my balls are gonna explode if I dont empty them!' He gives you a plea, no longer attempting to force his lust on you.";

to say Ride_Beag:
	say "     As you tell the beag that you want to ride his cock, his cocky smirk returns. 'Why didn't you say so earlier? We could have skipped the fighting,' he laughs. That may be, but you don't intend to give him full control of your coupling; you are the victor, after all. 'Fair, fair,' he concedes, sitting down with his back to [one of]a lamp post[or]the side of a building[or]the husk of a truck[at random] and tugging his underwear out of the way. 'Hop on, we can start sharing the love.'";
	say "     You reach down, your hand closing around his throbbing cock. His dickhead pulsates warmly in your palm -a testament to the intensity of this breeder's arousal. Lining the flared tip to your inner folds makes you moan out in desire, gleefully, you ride the bull like there's no tomorrow. Your womb grows full of beag precum- quickly escaping out of the sides as you wetly plap away- his face contorting to try to hold back. With one last slam of your hips, he cums before you, bloating you up with Firbolg seed- making you more awake and alert than ever. You jump a few more times for your own orgasm before you leave, the beag splayed on the ground only making a few quiet grumbles as you walk away.";
	CreatureSexAftermath "Player" receives "PussyFuck" from "Beag";

to say AssFuck_Beag:
	say "     You tell the beag to bend over and show you your prize, causing him to chuckle a bit as he obeys. 'I hope you've got the size to properly satisfy me. My [']brothers['] have given me high expectations,' he warns you good-naturedly. Part of you wants to tell him that that isn't your problem, but he does seem rather desperate, not to mention how soft and warm his ass looks. The beag finds a suitable spot and bends over, arching his back to better show off his backside for you. 'I'm waiting, oh mighty victor,' he teases you invitingly- tail swaying above his muscled cheeks to taunt your nature.";
	say "     Carefully, you use the beag's intense body sweat to lube up your [Cock of Player] cock before carefully planting yourself in his backdoor. He grinds himself into the floor as his hyper member churns up cum onto his chest and face a few times as you lose yourself in his tight rear. It doesn't take long for your tryst to come to an end as you lose tempo- quickly filling his hole with hot spunk, he moans whorishly to this new experience you've given him; hopefully he remembers for next time.";
	CreatureSexAftermath "Beag" receives "AssFuck" from "Player";



Section 2 - Creature Insertion

to say Beagdesc:
	say "     Your searching is interrupted by a large figure, a naked cowman with a human face and a large horse appendage standing in your way.
