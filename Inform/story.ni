[Absolute value]
To decide which number is the absolute value of (N - a number):
	if N is less than 0:
		let N be 0 minus N;
	decide on N.

To say a/an (T - text):
	let Txt be indexed text;
	let Txt be T;
	if Txt matches the regular expression "^<aeiouAEIOU>":
		say "an ";
	otherwise:
		say "a ";
	say T.

Instead of sniffing something (called x):
	if the scent of x is "":
		say "It smells pretty normal for a/an [x].";
	otherwise:
		say "[scent of x][line break]";

To wait for any key:
	if hypernull is 0:
		say "[link]more[as] [end link][run paragraph on]";
	keypause;

to clear the screen and hyperlink list:
	clear the screen;
	now hyperlink list is {}.
[This must remain whole or errors from cleared hyperlinks can occur!]


To keypause:
	(- KeyPause(); -)
