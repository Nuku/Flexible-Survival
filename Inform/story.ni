The parser error count is a number that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved] The parser error count is 0.

After printing a parser error when the parser error count is at least 0:
	increment the parser error count;
	if the turn count divided by the parser error count < three:
		say "(If you are feeling lost, try typing [italic type]help[roman type] for suggestions.)";
		now the parser error count is -1. [This ensures that we don't keep printing the message.]
