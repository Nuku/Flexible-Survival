Grey Abbey Library is fasttravel.

It is fasttravel.
Mall Foodcourt is a room. "Just inside the exit to the parking lot to the south is the food court. There are many metal tables with uncomfortable looking plastic chairs.

North of Smith Haven Mall Lot is Mall FoodCourt. 
Mall Atrium is a room. "A large open area, oppressively gloomy without the light. Furtive movements can be seen. When one focuses, the mall rats are not hard to spot.

It's somewhat dark, but not too dark as to see the emergency stairs are still accessible going up and down.".
West of Outside Trevor Labs is Trevor Labs Lobby.
2F Trevor Labs is a room. "The second floor of the labs. The lighting is dim, except for brilliant light shining from beneath a closed door at the end of the hallway.

Trevor Labs Lobby is below 2F Trevor Labs.
Primary Lab is a room. "One of the few places in the city with working power, this lab is brilliantly lit, showing off banks of busy computer terminals displaying dizzying amounts of information, largely obscure and technical.

There is only one window here, and it is mostly blocked by filing cabinets. Perhaps it is the light you saw outside.";
Primary Lab is north of 2F Trevor Labs.
There is an Infection Terminal in Primary Lab. "A glowing infection terminal quietly lists all the infections in the corner.".

The wall remains largely intact, with a sign that welcomes you into the park, except during night hours, not that anyone is enforcing this rule at the moment.".
Park Entrance is fasttravel.
Park Trail is a room. "Following this North/South trail, you can see dense woods to either side. You could easily become lost in them, though perhaps exploring might have its own rewards.

She speaks haltingly, as if she is not used to speaking anymore, 'You are too small, but maybe, later. For now, a gift.' She kneels before you and takes your [cock size desc of player] [cock of player] member into her beak, lapping over it with soft, wet, tongue. Her firm paw hands hold to your ass as she begins to bob slowly against you, making your flesh tingle with delight as she works at you expertly. All too soon you are spilling seed across that tongue, grunting with your own satisfaction. She rises, licking her beak. With a wink, she saunters off.[at random]";

Unable to resist, you move up and seize her well muscled hips and are soon pushing against her. With every sink of your [cock size desc of player] [cock of player] meat into her, she gives a pleasured,  keening sound. Her cunt squeezes around your hefty member, encouraging it until you blow your load deep inside of her dripping snatch.

Before you can wriggle away, it shoves up into you, pounding deeply and making your entire body shudder and quake. You can feel yourself being stretched painfully by the huge member as it batters against your cervix. The gryphon calls out above you, squeezing you close to her curvy front as hot seed rushes into you, directly injected into your womb with powerful cannon blasts.

Detecting you're ready, she slips up over you, pressing her large breasts to your [skin of player] [breast size desc of player] chest, smoothly slipping her black shaft into your eager and ready body. She kisses and licks at you, pressing that beak expertly to your lips, managing a fierce and passionate exchange despite it. You find your hands wandering over her sides, then drawing her closer as her love making becomes more and more intense. Your body grows tense before pleasure washes over you, but the gryphon is not yet sated, pistoning smoothly against you and crooning in an ear as she begins to bump you with the thick knot of her shaft. A firm shove, and it pops into place, locking her to you as your belly begins to swell with fertile seed. She shivers and buries her face into your neck as she peaks, remaining on top of you, hugging, for the minute it takes for her huge balls to unload.[impregchance] You are stuck to her, snuggling quietly, for what feels like an hour before she slips from you, kisses one last time, and departs.";

"[slut rat victory]"	"Towering over most, a tall intimidating wall of fur and leather. It appears female at first glance. Piercing its large directed ears are one ring a piece, one a goldish hue, and another silverish shade. It's covered from top to bottom in ebony black fur, that is, where clothing is not apparent. Her eyes are the same black shade as her hair, the left eye having a scar that runs an inch above downwards in a slicing motion to an inch or two below.
         She wears a rather large leather collar with a bell attached, the bell portion resting between the massive pillows of her chest, resting on top of them like some sort of sacred artifact. The bell makes no sound. Her breasts are restrained by her leather suit, the two upside down V's struggling mightily with small buckles between them just to keep them fastened and avoid falling apart. They might be seven or so inches in radius, and the leather doesn't do much to hide the details from the front, indents visible in the leather, revealing more than it ought to.[line break]
         Her arms are long and slender, with black fur, and bright pink shaded paws. The paws have clearly defined fingers, looking quite capable of grasping things, or clawing, with sharp black shaded tips to them. Her midsection is slim and trim, and also concealed fully by the leather bodice she wears, clinging tightly to her contours.[line break]
         Gazing at her from the back, it can be seen that the leather doesn't cover much back there beyond decency. Her furred buttocks and thighs are visible, though calves are again covered in the suit. From the front, an odd sight greets the eyes. The contours of the leather shape outwards from her thighs and along her belly, the shape is distinct and hard to miss, as if this bizarre furred female were in the possession of monstrously large male genitalia. She makes no move to be discreet or hide this abnormality, seeming perfectly at ease with its existence, probably having been the one to modify the suit in the first place to cope with such an unwieldy intruder.[line break]

Everything is going just fine, and then your heat strikes again, and you find yourself in his apartment, on your hands and knees, offering yourself up to him. After what feels like an eternity, he takes you up on, your howls of pleasure mingling as he drives into your needy body.

It doesn't take long before the echoing howls, calling your fellows to hunt, causing even the most ferocious mutants and monsters to look for a place to hide. Those caught were either devoured, or subdued and dragged back to your dens, their bodies changed and their minds worn down by a furious night of animal passion. Thick cum filled their every hole, the slick passion of the females coating their cocks and muzzles. Any female captured is pregnant by dawn, the high birth rate needed to keep up with the attrition rate, the city is not safe. You are the absolute ruler of your domain, a pity your mind is too far gone to appreciate it..”;
