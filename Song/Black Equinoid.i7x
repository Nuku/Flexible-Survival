It's warm and firm, and she soon begins to lactate for you. Her milk is thick and sweet and fills your body with soothing tingles from head to foot.

Name (text)	Type (text)	Subtype (text)	Ending (rule)	Priority (number)	Triggered (truth state)
"Black Equinoid Infection"	"Infection"	""	Black Equinoid Infection rule	1000	false

This is the Black Equinoid Infection rule:
	if Player has a body of "Black Equinoid":
		trigger ending "Black Equinoid Infection"; [Here it states, that the ending has been played.]
		if humanity of Player < 10:
			if ending "Honey's Epilogue" is triggered:
				make no decision;
			say "     Following a compulsion, you seek out other horses in the park and are soon welcomed into the herd proper. Together, you defend the park against interlopers, be they mutant or human. The exception are the bees; they're tolerated for their benefit to the local flora and their delicious honey. There are some city horses as well that come by from time to time. They seem friendly enough at first, but when the herd members who go with them don't return - or have been reduced to horny sluts who will no longer fight - the interlopers are no longer permitted to come. They send raids from time to time, but the herd knows the park forests well and survives with only a few losses.";
		else:
			say "     There is some confusion at first when your equinoid body is brought in, for there are several strains of equines and proper classification is slow. It seems ones like you are rare, few leaving the park where they're established. Once that's resolved, it goes much more smoothly, as you're not considered a dangerous strain. A movie producer spots you on TV as you are released and hires you immediately to play a minotaur-like creature in his upcoming movie. It turns out to be a [one of]big blockbuster, providing more than enough money[or]lukewarm summer movie and provides some cash[or]big flop, but it provides just enough cash[at random] to start a new, peaceful life. Eventually becoming a naturalist, you study nature, and using your movie experience as a hoofhold, you get your own nature show [if intelligence of Player > 14 and charisma of Player > 14]that lasts several seasons. It does rather well, being insightful and intelligent while also well presented and entertaining[else]for a brief time[end if].";

"lucky horseshoe"	"A lucky horseshoe. You heard somewhere that throwing it over your shoulder gets good luck. Weird, huh?"	1	lucky horseshoe

lucky horseshoe is a grab object.

instead of sniffing lucky horseshoe:
	say "The horseshoe smells of earth and old metal.";

Usedesc of lucky horseshoe is "[lucky horseshoe use]";

to say lucky horseshoe use:
	say "You hurl the horseshoe over your [one of]left[or]right[at random] shoulder and don't look back, hoping for the best.";
	if a random chance of 1 in 20 succeeds:
		say "As you walk away, you trip over something!";
		sort Table of Random Critters in random order;
		repeat with x running from 1 to the number of rows in Table of Random Critters:
			choose row x in Table of Random Critters;

			let z be loot entry;

Black Equinoid ends here.
