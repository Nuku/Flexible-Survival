Version 2 of Consolidated Outside Events by Song begins here.
[ Version 1.0 - Consolidatedbackground events - Stripes ]
[ Version 1.1 - Commented out #4 from set - Stripes     ]
[ Version 2.0 - Sweeping update - Song
	- Renamed "CEOutside" to "Consolidated Outside Events" for clarity
	- Moved file from Stripes' folder to Song's folder. To see the detailed GitHub changelog for the file pre-move, access the primary repository using a commit earlier than this one, or check a stale branch from another contributor. This will allow you to look at the history of the now-removed CEOutside in Stripes' folder
	- Restructured content into separate event names under the same file. This allows players to hunt for specific events and avoids a generic and uninformative event title
	- Removed old, commented-out event #4 altogether to reduce file length and make it easier to tell which content is still relevant. The old content can be salvaged if necessary by looking through the removed file's changelog - see above for details on how to do so
	- General writing and formatting cleanup. Importantly, added prefix spacing in say messages and cleaned up sentence structure

Instead of resolving Grumpy Old Men:
	say "     While walking down the city streets, you stop when your eyes catch the form of two old men, a tiger and a wolf, arguing with each other while waving their hands up and down wildly at one another. Worrying that the two are about to start a fight, you watch as they move right on down the street past you, completely ignoring you. You wonder if you should speak up to say anything to stop their argument, but you find your words disappearing inside of your throat as you listen to their conversation, if only in bits and pieces.";
	say "     'Harry, you're too old be this cranky anymore,' the wolf says while walking next to his friend. The lupine seems a bit embarrassed by the feline, though he smiles all the while. 'I'll be too old when they put me in the grave. Until then, keep your fuzzy tail moving so we can find old Alma to see if we can borrow some of that ammunition of hers,' the tiger grumbles. 'Do you really think she survived all of this?' the wolf asks, waving his hand around to denote the mess that the town has become. The graying tiger gives the silver wolf a pointed look. 'I sure as hell do! Hell, knowing her, she's probably taking in refuges!' The tiger lets out a roar of laughter before hissing and leaning over to rub at his lower back. In a heartbeat, the wolf is helping the other by offering a shoulder, though the feline is a little too proud, or stubborn, to take it.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Will you let me be?! I can manage just fine. I haven't gotten that old, damnit!' the tiger says, even while taking the arm of his cohort. 'I know, I know, sure shot. However, if you won't let me help you, then who will you let tend to your wounds?' The wolf seems to speak somewhat more softly at his friend. The tiger says nothing as he looks up into the bright eyes of his friend, before quickly turning his head to grumble something while using the wolf as a crutch. 'You keep this up, and the next thing you know, I'll be asking you to cook for me.' The wolf laughs in response. 'Harry, I already cook for you.' 'Yeah, but I don't have to ask for it just yet.' A playful smile crosses the feline's muzzle, and the lupine almost seems to flush at the other's statement.";
	say "     The two men walk down the street, the tiger slipping away from the wolf after he regains some of his balance. They continue to fuss at each other playfully while their tails wrap tightly around each other, and soon the two are out of sight. You can only hope that you'll have a friend like that when you reach the age of those old men.";

As it sprints closer, you realize that it's some kind of minotaur, and you dodge it just in time to avoid being pulverized. To your surprise, the creature runs straight past you, ignoring your presence entirely and hightailing it at top speeds in the direction you just came from. Seeing the odd creature running so fast makes wonder what the hell could scare it so badly, only for the answer to come in the form of a hyena dominatrix charging down the street with a whip in her hand.";
	say "     The woman, who can't be more than five foot eight inches tall, is wearing nothing but a black bustier and stiletto boots, and she cackles manically as she follows the minotaur's trail. You're impressed that the hyena could actually frighten a creature almost twice her size and two and half heads taller than her, and you can't help but wonder what's up with that pair. Just before the woman is totally out of sight, you swear that you hear her say something along the lines of 'Call me queen, darling!'";

Instead of resolving Scavenging Dalmatian:

You have all of a half second to realize that you may have made a slight mistake as you watch the creature run toward you after seeing the small parcel of food in your outstretched hand. Bracing yourself for impact, you expect to be knocked onto the asphalt, but the Dalmatian creature simply skids to a stop two feet from your outstretched hand. Lowering itself to its haunches to beg like a normal canine, the Dal whines pleadingly while staring up at you with big, soulful brown eyes.";
			say "     Their whines of hunger are almost heartbreaking to hear. You set the food down in front of the anthro and then take a step back, watching as the spotted creature quickly gobbles up the food as though it hadn't eaten in days. Knowing how rough things are here in this city, the Dal was probably starving. When the dog finishes, it turns its muzzle to look up at you adoringly and then gives you a happy bark before trotting off. Even though you're shorter on provisions now, you feel good about feeding the hungry creature.";

		if player consents:
			say "     Whistling to get the anthro Dalmatian's attention, you watch as it turns and then looks down to see what you put on the ground at your feet. Turning to step away from the cano-mutant, you're already moving off on your way just as your ears pick up the sound of charging footsteps to grasp your left-behind treats. It might not have been much, but it was all that you had on you. A sense of relief washes over you at having helped a starving creature in the midst of all this chaos.";

Instead of resolving Captured Wyvern:
	say "     Coming across a large group of soldiers, you notice that the uniformed men and women seem to have somehow brought a wyvern down onto the ground and are currently staring at the mutant irritably. The large beast, which has to be almost thirty feet long, cries and chirps loudly as the soldiers begin to shout and kick at it. The desperation in some of the humans['] voices has your body tensing as you watch the assembled collective.";
	say "     Not saying so much as a word to alert them of your presence, you watch the troops begin to viciously beat at the creature with both their boots and the ends of their long assault rifles. Blood and other fluids slowly start to leak around the defenseless creature's body in a quickly growing pool. Why, if they have already downed the mutant, don't they just kill it already? As the monster's cries of pain grow steadily louder, you feel compelled to interfere and protect it. Do you follow through on the urge?";
	if player consents:
		say "     You can't bear to watch the soldiers torturing another living being, even one as monstrous as this. You furtively draw closer to the assembled group, waiting for an opportune moment, then loose a shrill battle cry as you hurl yourself into the fray. The men and women flip their heads around to look at you, but all they can see is a speeding ball of fury as you crash into the ones closest to the downed wyvern. Throwing the miscreants away from the beast, you find yourself looking at all of slightly scared soldiers in anger before suddenly flying into them. Punching and kicking and hissing at them like a mother protecting her young, you send the confused soldiers scattering as you savage anyone too slow, or too stupid, not to get away from the mutant.";
		say "     By the time you're done with them, your knuckles are wet with blood. Whether it belongs to the other humans, the wyvern's, or your own, you do not know, but it doesn't matter in the face of having sent the others away from your charge. Turning around to look at the poor creature, you realize that the wyvern is looking at you intensely with its strange, vertically slitted eyes. An understanding seems to go through you both as you flush down at the monster. Maybe now would be a good time for you to perform some first aid on the creature. Do you even have a medkit?";
		WaitLineBreak;
		if medkit is owned:
			say "     While you're no doctor, you manage to use your medical kit to stitch and patch up whatever wounds you can find on the big beast. A few chirps of pain come from the creature, but you just tell it to grin and bear it, as this is the cost of being taken care of. Once you are done, you take a few steps back to look at your [italic type]patient[roman type] and then nod accordingly when you see the other look over its battered and worn body. Blood quickly stains the bandages that you have wrapped around the wyvern as the mutant tries to get up.";
			say "     You have to quickly hush the thing to prevent it from ruining all of your hard work, quickly comforting the beast into settling down. You try and tell it not to move and that it needs to rest before it can recover fully. The monster seems somewhat hesitant about doing so, and looking around, you can understand why, as the area you both are in is quite open to possible attack, either from the soldiers or other mutants. Giving a sigh of exasperation, you slowly pad up to the reptilian creature's muzzle and then pat the wyvern on the snout gently before telling it that you will watch over it. The beast slowly relaxes and then settles down to rest. Once the wyvern is snoring in sleep, you prepare yourself to stand guard over the creature in order to keep your promise.";
			say "     Thankfully, you encounter little trouble, as neither the soldiers or any other mutants come around the vulnerable critter. The size and smell of it probably scare off anything with a shred of common sense. That soon changes, however, when a flock of wyverns come around to see about their missing companion. Noticing the large assortment of flying creatures, you decide that it's time to beat feet out of here. You've done your good deed for the day, after all.";

		else:
			say "     Shaking your head, you go over and around the sides of the beast, tending to its wounds the best you can with your limited supplies as you strip your shirt off of your body to use for makeshift bandages. Tearing off strips of your upper garment, and even your pants in order to have enough material, you work carefully, but determinedly to cover the wyvern's grisly wounds, going over the entirety of the monster from top to tail.";
			say "     Looking at the creature to gauge how it feels, you see that your attempts to mend its wounds took too long for your patient's attention, as the wyvern is now asleep. Snorting somewhat in annoyance, you admit a genuine smile as you look down at the flying mutant with wonder. While you wouldn't want to face one of these in battle, you can't help but marvel slightly at the beauty of the creature before you. Reaching out to stroke the sleeping beast's muzzle, you suddenly go rigid as you hear the cries of other wyverns shouting throughout the sky above you.";
			say "     You find yourself moving on quick feet as you hightail it away from the wyvern before its friends can come around to see you standing there with their wounded kin. Kindness notwithstanding, you're not foolish enough to try and explain to a bunch of angry mutants that you didn't hurt their friend.";

	else:
		say "     The soldiers are just doing their job, you think with some confliction. You have no right to get involved, and there's always the risk of being gunned down yourself if you tried to play the hero. Shaking your head, you turn away and let the uniform-wearing men and women go about their [italic type]duty[roman type] without looking back. The loud chirps of the wyvern seem to grow louder, almost as if calling out for help, but then go quiet all of a sudden.";

Instead of resolving School Spirit:

Judging by the uniforms, the cheerleaders were from the local college. All the uniforms are ripped around the middle, almost as if the bellies of all the cheerleaders grew until they ripped through their uniforms. You can only surmise that a creature must have boarded the bus and impregnated every single cheerleader with its infectious seed. Feeling uneasy, you quietly leave the bus and sneak away before the cheerleaders or their spawn return.";

The creature is vigorously masturbating its rubbery cock, creating a loud squeaking sound with each stroke. When it notices your presence, you brace yourself for a fight. Thankfully, the creature decides to ignore you and goes back to masturbating. You sigh with relief and leave before it can change its mind.";

Instead of resolving Ice Cream Truck:
	say "     An abandoned ice cream truck sits on its lonesome in the middle of the street. You quickly investigate it to check if there's anything edible that hasn't already been scavenged. Looking in the cooler in back, you are disappointed to find that the ice cream has melted all over the place, soaking the inside of the truck. Taking a whiff of a strange smell, you realize that the sticky white stuff may not be ice cream after all, but someone or something's cream. You might be able to find something useful here, but it would be messy. Do you try?";

Instead of resolving Strange Preacher:
	say "     Wandering the deserted streets, you hear what sounds like a loud voice father down the street. Hurrying to see who is talking, you are shocked to see a strange creature shouting out to an empty street. Moving closer in case this is some kind of trick, you get a better look at the creature and find yourself shaking your head in astonishment. With the lower body of one of those panther taurs, she is resting her front legs on a box of some type while her back ones brace her on the street, her spread legs giving you a good look at hir erect feline cock. Behind hir, a long reptilian tail is lashing in time with her words, its scaled length almost as long as her entire furred lower body. Her torso seems to be covered in rough brown dog fur, with a bovine udder hanging off her upper body's stomach. Her arms are twisted around and pulled up into almost wyvern-like wings, obviously not strong enough to lift her even an inch off the ground. It is almost startling to see the rather human head sitting on the shoulders of the creature, her eyes closed as she continues to speak.";
	say "     Realizing that you've been staring at her form and not paying attention to what she's actually saying, you pause to listen for a minute. Listening to her speak, it quickly becomes obvious that she is singing the praises of something called the church of the maternal beast and someone she calls the Great Mother. She appears to be trying to appeal to the infected by telling them to embrace the changes, and the new sexuality sweeping the city, but not to let it overwhelm them. She continues on in lewd detail about the things that one should be careful of doing, or else you might give in and lose yourself completely. Her body shakes as she depicts several strange lewd acts to be avoided, and you can see her hind legs pumping her erect cock in the empty air eagerly as she continues to get more and more explicit in her descriptions. Shaking your head at the absurdity of it all, you leave the strange thing to its preaching, unsure if it even noticed you stopping to listen for a minute.";

They jeer at one another and toss trash across the alley dividing their buildings. Focused on their mutual hatred, they don't notice you, but you do steer clear, certain that you'd not be able to fight off the horde populating either building... or worse, end up as some sort of prize in a battle between them.
