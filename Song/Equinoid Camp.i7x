A few of the others have spoken of the defeats you have given them. We are a herd of powerful warriors and the herd could use others like you. I'm sure you would find our companionship most enjoyable,' she adds, running her hands over her body sexily.";

She smiles and nods, confident in her tribe's greatness to convince you. She takes you deeper into the park along a path you'd not noticed before. In time, you reach a barricade of wooden stakes with a stern looking horse herm guarding the gate.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Halt, Amaryllis! Who is this outsider you bring to the herd? You were warned, Amaryllis. No more strays.' The large equine plants the base of her spear firmly in the ground and glares at the equinoid with you.";

		say "     Bryony just snorts in response and reiterates that only members of the herd may enter the camp. As the two equinoids start to argue, it draws the attention of others. When one strides up wearing an ornate headdress made from carved wood and colorful wire, the others grow silent. This one, clearly someone in authority, looks you over.";

		say "     'So, Amaryllis, you have found another? Your eagerness to grow the pride is commendable, but is this one truly worthy? Many of the herd are not happy to see [ObjPro of player] here after entering our territory and fighting with your herd sisters.'";
		say "     Glancing around, you do see that the crowd has grown and not all of them are looking at you with the usual sexual interest you've come to expect from the infected, but instead with a sterner look. Perhaps this wasn't such a good idea, but you can't really back down now either, at least not to their faces. You decide the best course of action is to be strong, as they seem to respect that. You [if player is not defaultnamed]introduce yourself as [name of player], then [end if]tell their leader that you've seen their strength and that you've proven your own to them. You add that Amaryllis has spoken of the herd and has convinced you that you would be stronger together.";
		say "     Their leader scrutinizes you with a keen eye while you talk. 'Perhaps you might convince us of your good intentions towards the herd. We are in a dispute with the Painted Wolves. Confront and defeat them on our behalf and perhaps you might be found worthy.' There is considerable whispering among the equines and Amaryllis blanches a little.";
		say "     Seeing a way out, you agree to her terms. You are ordered to defeat at least three of them before you'll be welcome again at their gates. While you're uncertain how they could know if you are actually successful, there's no need for you to come back if you don't want to, either.";

	else:
		LineBreak;
		say "     You shrug and turn away, leaving her behind as she alternates between moaning for you to come and threatening you with reprisals for rejecting the herd. You have little worry though, having beaten several of these [']great warriors['] already.";
