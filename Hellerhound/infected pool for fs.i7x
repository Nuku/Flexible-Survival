		say "After your ferocity in defending the pool, the wyverns decide they have had enough and leave, crashing a path through the park. It seems to head in the direction of the city.";

instead of resolving a pure pool:
	if purpol is 0:
		say "You smell in the air a slight difference, seeming cleaner, more pure. You look around for the source.";
		say "You come across a pool of water in the park. Unlike the puddles in the city, this one is clean and clear, and you can see the red stones at the bottom. You take a small drink, and feel less thirsty.";

		say "Do you check out the situation?";
		if player consents:

By the time the wyverns turn around and notice you, you are about to blow your load.";
						if a random chance of one in 2 succeeds:
							say "They begin stroking as well, rushing to come before you.";
						otherwise:
							say "They watch as you continue, stunned that someone would have the precocity to subvert their efforts.";
						say "You blow your load into the pool, thick streams of seed coming from your [cock length of player] inch long [cock of player] [if the cocks of player > 1][one of]cock[or]penis[or]shaft[or]maleness[at random][otherwise][one of]cocks[or]penises[or]shafts[or]malenesses[at random][end if] and scream as well. The seed sprays into the pool, making the water murky and infecting the whole thing. The water becomes cloudy and the clean smell in the air disappears.";
