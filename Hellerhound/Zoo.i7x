You know from experience that the walls extend all the way around the park, which would explain why no creatures ever left it, or did they?".

The zoo is bordered with a metal fence, in the spikes you would expect on the edge of a large mansion. The city wall is to the north.

Fence Path is north of Zoo entrance. east of fence path is cheetah habitat. north of fence path is Border Wall.
Border Wall is a room. "A huge wall that borders the city to the north. Nobody saw it as necessary, but it got the mayors brother's construction company a lot of money. It is tall, made of yellow sandstone and seems to have survived the quake intact.".

Guardhouse is a room. "The guardhouse is grey and forbidding, daring any to commit crimes nearby. On a hangar inside are the keys to the exhibits. They have drawings on them and are color coded for their door. The guards are nowhere to be seen. Odd.".

					say "Soon, you climax, and your wet juices soak his fur, leaving a dark patch right above where his cock is.";
					say "Basking in the afterglow, you realize with sadness that he hasn't come yet, and pull out, turning and taking his feline head into your hands.";

		otherwise if cheetahmate is 2:
			if the cockname of the player is "Feral Cheetah":
				say "You turn yourself over, showing your ready cunt to your mate, and he pounces, driving himself home in one quick, fluid motion. He pounds at you, his balls slapping your ass as you thrust back, trying to get him as deep as you can. A haze of pleasure begins to cloud your eyes, and by the time your climax comes, you are no longer in conscious control. The feeling of his warm seed filling your insides is welcome, and his little barbs tickle as his cock pulses.[impregchance]";
