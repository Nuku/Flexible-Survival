to say ResolveEvent Fallen Survivor:
	say "     You come across a succumbed survivor slumped on the pavement with their back to a crumbling building. The motionless yet still breathing body fails to react to anything you do to try and snap them back to consciousness. Dragging the man under a nearby piece of intact roof, you place him in a way that he at least won't be quite as exposed or get rained upon. Still, his eyes do not even focus on you as you open them, just staring off into empty space. Your inability to help this person or even get any answers of what happened to him causes you to feel intensely uncomfortable, and just being close to the body seems to sap your drive and go on and struggle to survive. Maybe you should just... lay down with him. All of this is pointless, isn't it? You're never going to get out of - *CRASH, YOWL*[line break]";
	say "     The sudden metallic noise from behind you makes you jump out of your boots almost, whirling around to see what caused it. You see the tail end of a large house-cat zip around the nearby corner, leaving behind a large disc of metal that must have fallen over as it pushed past it. Upon further examination, you see that it is a garbage can lid - one that has been used to create an improvised shield. There are loops of leather riveted to the inside to slip your forearm through, as well as a painted front. Seems like the survivor had a DIY streak before he succumbed to... whatever got to him. Looking back over to the guy, you realize that you were on the best way to join him in his mind-broken state. Getting into contact seems to have negative side effects. That cat really saved your bacon!";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Glancing back over to the mind-broken survivor, you resolve not to get anywhere close to him again. Hmpf, but hey - at least you got a nice shield out of this dreary situation. Then you notice what seems to be a pale, translucent 'grease' stubbornly smeared across the shield, including on the inside. Could this be what put the guy into the state he is in? Possibly... which means even the shield is useless to you. Or could you wipe it off with some of the scattered and ripped articles of clothing ever-present on the abandoned streets? It'd be risky, as you can't know if you'll manage to get it all off, but that still might be worth it, in the current situation.";
	say "     [bold type]Do you want to take the shield with you?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Sure, it might be useful.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Nah, leave it. Surely it also carries his deadly contagion!";
	if Player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     You gather some scraps of fabric and rub away at the shield, discarding them before they can soak through and any of the gunk touches your skin. Eventually you have the thing fairly clean, enough so to handle it (you hope).";
		ItemGain garbage can shield by 1;
	else:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Deciding with your better judgement, you resolve to leave the garbage can shield behind. However, you do drag it over and prop it up next to its mind-broken owner, as a bit of a warning sign for someone who might stumble over him. Sadly, this is the only tribute you can give this resourceful survivor...";
