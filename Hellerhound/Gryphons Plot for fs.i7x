							if the cunts of the player > 0 and the cunt length of the player > 12:
								say "Then you turn around and point your rear in his direction. Already subsumed by the infection, he slams his smaller cock into your waiting hole, pistoning in and out. As the juices drip onto the back of the jeep, he leans in with a cry and climaxes into you.";
								say " [impregchance]";
