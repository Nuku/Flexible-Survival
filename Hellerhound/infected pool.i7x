instead of resolving Pure Pool:
	if PurePoolSeen is false:
		say "     You smell in the air a slight difference, seeming cleaner, more pure. You look around for the source.";
		say "     You come across a pool of water in the park. Unlike the puddles in the city, this one is clean and clear, and you can see the red stones at the bottom. You take a small drink and feel less thirsty.";

		now PurePoolSeen is true;
		now Resolution of Pure Pool is 1; [saw the pool]
	else if PurePoolSeen is true:
		say "     Exploring the park, you hear an echoing scream. It sounds like a wyvern, but what are those doing in the park?";
		say "     Do you check out the situation?";
		if player consents:
			say "     You follow the sound to the clear pool you found before. However, two wyverns are fighting. It is pretty obvious from the dialogue that they want to infect the pool, but cannot agree on who will do it first.";
			if player is male and libido of player > 49:
				if cockname of player is "Wyvern":
					say "     You could help resolve the situation by corrupting the pond yourself. Do you wish to do so?";

						if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
							say ". They begin stroking as well, rushing to come before you.";
						else:
							say ". They watch as you continue, stunned that someone would have the precocity to subvert their efforts.";
						say "     You blow your load into the pool, thick streams of seed spraying from your [cock of player] [one of]cock[smn][or]penis[esmn][or]shaft[smn][or]maleness[esmn][at random], and you scream as your powerful orgasm overtakes you. The seed soaks into the pool, leaving the water murky and infecting the whole thing. The pool becomes cloudy and the clean smell in the air disappears.";

		wait for any key;
		challenge "Wyvern";
		say "     After your ferocity in defending the pool, the wyverns decide they have had enough and leave, crashing a path through the park that leads in the direction of the city. Now that you've saved the pool from the danger of infection, you decide that it owes you a good drink and dip your head into the clear water.";
		ThirstReset;
		now Resolution of Pure Pool is 3; [player fought wyverns to save the pool]
	else:
		say "     You watch silently as the first wyvern overpowers the second, and begins to stroke. This is your last chance to intervene. Do you?";
		if player consents:
			challenge "Wyvern";
			say "     After you finish with the first wyvern, the second attacks!";
			wait for any key;
			challenge "Wyvern";
			say "     After freeing the pool from the danger of infection, you decide that it owes you a good drink.";
			ThirstReset;
			now Resolution of Pure Pool is 3; [player fought wyverns to save the pool]
		else:
			say "     You watch as the wyvern screams like it did before, then blows its load into the pool, clouding the water and dissipating the clean smell about the area.";
