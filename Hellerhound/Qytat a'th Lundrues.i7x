'You don't seem lost to the infection like most of my kind.' she says, but before you can explain who you are, she makes the conclusion by herself. 'You might be an outsider, but honestly... we don't really care anymore. Our kind has been lost to sex craziness after the nanites were spread among the city, so we're in dire need of sane allies.' The guard signals you to come closer, no longer in a defensive stance. 'We fear the entire species may succumb, one day... so we do our best to protect ourselves. You'll have to forgive me for my initial hostility. I'm Azure, by the way. Nice to meet you.'";

Intrigued, you ask her more about the ghostly staircase that remains hidden from the outsiders, to which she reveals the fact it moves from time to time, but which comes to rest at the same spots.

Staircase Entry is a room. "     Now that you stand upon the staircase, you can see it much more clearly and it becomes solid to your eyes. The staircase stands before you, the legendary path to Qytat a'th Lundrues, the city of the flying. It is a blue silver of some higher element, and the stairs are floating, sliding a little with the slight breeze, but maintaining their orderly position. The stairs glow, and the warmth radiating from them makes you comforted and happy. You can feel a faint, unseen wall around them which grows a translucent blue as the steps spiral up into the sky. You have a feeling that this strange material is completely invisible from the outside.".

Stairs is a room. "     The glowing steps extend above and behind you, spiraling upwards. The faint blue material forming the concealing walls provides something to rest your hand against as you traverse the long staircase to the heavens.

Qytat Plaza is a room. "     The ground here is the same blue as the stairs, and warm underfoot. There is a great spiral pattern on the blocks and it seems to change when you aren't looking. There are no buildings here, instead ropes hang down from tents and huts, glowing like the rest, and seemingly unsupported. These ropes are all out of reach and you can't see any signs of others up there. The only person you can see here is a male gryphon in a white uniform lounging nearby.".

Qytat Plaza is above Stairs.

Spiral Pattern is a thing. "     The pattern is shifting, and it looks like a great circle, so large you cannot see the other side, with images of helixes and small spheres with arms, odd spherical bubbles with rotating balls around them, the only obvious things that change place, and what looks like a circuit diagram below all of that. It feels soft and warm, yet it doesn't give when you step. You feel creeped out.".

Spiral Pattern is in Qytat Plaza.
