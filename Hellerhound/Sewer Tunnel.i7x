A large river runs through the center, filled with muck from the city. From the direction it heads, you ascertain that it leads down to the sea. This must be the major drainage duct.[line break][if Perception of Player > 12]It doesn't look like there are many infected in the water. Maybe something of value could be found if you [bold type]search[roman type]?[end if]".
