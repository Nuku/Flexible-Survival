		say "You spot a sword in the middle of the mess, coated so thoroughly with the juices that you suspect it was the target for the raids, and the source of the jubilation of victory. Its metal is cloudy and coated with thick slime, and the pommel is dried cum of some unknown creature, glowing white. It looks like a powerful, but dangerous weapon. Do you want to walk into the mess and take it?";
		if the player consents: 
			say "You slosh through the mess, leaving a trail that fill after a couple of seconds. You get to the sword, and place it in your backpack, and trudge back.";
			if a random number between 1 and 25 > the dexterity of the player:
				say "On the way, you fall headlong into the slime, and it takes a while to get up. After you emerge, you cough up slime and wipe it off your body.";

	if the player consents:
		say "In a nearby bush you find a riding saddle and riding boots, both women's. It seems as if a woman went riding in the park when the infection broke out. Her horse changed, and raped her.

		if the perception of the player is greater than a random number between one and 20:
			say "In one of the puddles of cum you find a whip with metal bits strung throughout it. It looks as if the rider carried it, and lost it in the fray. it is currently covered with cum, but if you have enough water, you could change that. Do you wish to?";
