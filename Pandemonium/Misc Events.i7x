to say ResolveEvent Visceral Painting:
	say "     Wandering the museum hallways, you stop for a minute [one of]to look at some of the artwork [or]to get your bearings [at random]when one of the paintings near you catches your eye. The frame is nothing special, just four plain dark oak pieces of wood, but the subject of the painting is so visceral that you can't help but look at it for a moment. Painted in oil is a young man, athletic and half naked, running away from four pursuers. The young man runs in front of a large oak tree in what looks like the beginning of spring, given the melting snow in the muddy ditch the young man flees through. He's glancing back towards his pursuers, his back facing you, his legs covered in caked mud, his arms stratched up.";
	say "     The pursuers wear formal attire, almost like French military uniforms but filthy. They carry rifles but they don't aim for the young man. Instead, the four older men, with grins on their faces, hold their rifles as they might pitchforks. One man, presumeably the leader, has very little grime on his clothes, and he's pointing towards the young man. He's biting his lips and leering at the naked man. You can see every wrinkle on his face and it looks like the artist took the time to paint every strand of hair. Clearly, this painting says a lot more now that this scene plays out every day. You look around the painting for a plaque for the name of the piece. 'The Hunt in Spring' is its name, but there's no attribution for the artist.";

You blink and shake your head. And now that you blinked, they seem to have moved a third time! The huntsmen are closer to the running young man, who in turn has more mud on his legs. He's gotten passed the tree by now, and the snow has completely melted. You take a step backwards. The master huntsman, the cleanest man in the image before you, now points down to the ground, and although he was looking towards the young man before, he now looks out towards the artist. Wait, no, he now looks right at you. He stares into your eyes and you can see his sexual appetite, even for someone he'll never have, assuming he cannot jump out of the painting.";
		say "     Though now you can't help but wonder if he could jump out into the real world as you continue to stare into his red eyes. Were you this horny before? Your breathing has turned into panting as you stare at the older huntsman. You start to wonder if he's gotten bigger or if you've gotten closer to him, but then you blink and realize he walked forward in the painting, closer to the painter's perspective. By now, the young man has been caught. Blood trickles down his face from a fresh wound as the hunters pin him down, whipping out their cocks. You look back to their leader, who continues to point downwards and grins at you. You look at where he's pointing, and beyond the frame is a small bench. You hadn't seen it before. Under the bench are broken bottles of water, but you investigate and find a full bottle. You take it and leave, the museum's visceral painting wearing on your uneasy mind.";

		say "     As you look at the plaque, something on the wall moves in the corner of your eye. You look up and don't notice anyone. You look around -- at the far wall, the dark corner, even the small bench nearby -- but don't see anyone. You look back to the painting and it seems to have moved. The huntsmen are upon their prey, who has gotten more mud on his legs. They're completely passed the tree. Was the painting like this before? The young man has blood trickling down his face and the master hunstman, the cleanest man in the image before you, presses his heel into the young man's crotch. The other hunters have whipped out their dicks and are clearly about to have their way with the young man. You aren't sure if you even remember what this painting looked like a few seconds ago, but you thought the hunters were chasing someone, as opposed to this image in front of you. Deciding that you must be misremembering, you take your leave, hoping to find something useful in the remnants of the museum.";

to say ResolveEvent Tide Pool Trouble:
	say "     As you meander down the beach, waves crash against rocks not too far ahead of you. The rocks litter this part of the shore. You cannot help but walk on some, but most of these are beter described as boulders. Not much farther ahead, there are various boulders jutting out from the shore, towering above you the size of small buildings. You see the tide pools at your feet as you walk towards these towering boulders. Small fish swim as you move from rock to rock. As you approach the tallest rock, you notice something in one of the tide pools under that great boulder causes the water to splash out vigorously. The water seems to bubble out from the shallow water. Could this be the entrance to some underwater cavern? The water seems to positively come alive as you approach.";

There's a figure you can just barely make out in the white waters. It looks... it looks like... a slithering ball of tentacles! Or wait, no, that's just a snake coiling around something beneath the surface of the water. It's chasing something under there! Before you have a chance to back away, a rat darts out of the pool, heading right for you! The snake, in turn, slithers out of the water. You tense up, ready to fight, to defend yourself against this reptilian predator. But seeing you, the little rat hesitates, giving the snake all the time it needs to catch its prey. You stand there, almost in shock, as the snake devours the rat.";
		say "     Once it completely swallows its prey, the snake slithers onto a nearby rock away from the shore to digest the poor rat. Looking back at the tide pool, you see that its waters are calm once more. Strange how the pool returns to normal so quickly. Now that nothing's stirring up the water, you can see some colorful fabric at the bottom of the pool. After checking to make sure nobody's around to pounce on you, you bend down to the tide pool and stick your hand into it. You retrieve what turns out to be striped board shorts and see that they're in remarkably good shape. At least you got something out of all of this, even though it has unsettled you a little to see the animals fight of life and death.";

You're pretty sure you can even hear the faint squeaks of a monster coming from the water's surface. Rather than dealing with a fight with an unknown foe, though, you decide to walk back. You pick up your pace as you leave the strange tide pools behind you.";

But then the frog clears his throat, or merely croaks you can't tell. He's wearing just a pair of boxers. When he speaks, it's clearly French. You stiffle a laugh, but that only enflames him more. Given his intensity and the gestures he's making towards his classmates, he's probably angry that he isn't a more appropriate animal, like a Gallic cock. Even though you don't speak French, you think you understand his point, so you ask him to speak more quietly. While he doesn't seem to understand English, he certainly can understand what you mean when you lower your own voice when talking to him. He then nods with a sigh.";

You turn the corner and see two humanoid creatures arguing with one another, but you can only barely make out what's being said. One of them is a donkey boy, who is yelling very loudly, and the other is an elephant girl, who is covering her giant ears as best she can. The boy is in a nice suit with a purple tie and stands over the girl by a solid foot, yelling down at her in her yellow sunday dress. She also wears a bangle with a purple gem in it. The other people walking around them seem to know the couple, as both the elephant and the donkey nod or smile at this person or that one as though nothing is happening. You can't help but wonder what their problem is. Maybe they're poli-sci students and this is just a very intense debate?";

You then realize that this is, in fact, not a debate. At all. You're too close to them, walking directly towards them, to just turn around and save face, so you try to redirect yourself towards the poli-sci building's entrance. It's just that the couple is directly in between you and the door! The donkey sees you and glares. 'Can I help you?' he asks. You try to say something, anything, but before you have a chance, the elephant girl says, 'Have you met Mark?' She lets go of her ears, grabs your arm, then pulls you towards her. She glares at the donkey boy. 'I've been fucking Mark, too.' The donkey's eyes widen and he goes silent. 'And Danny,' she says as she gestures to a passing gorilla. 'And a whole slew of other men!' If you could regret coming over here more than you already did, you would probably melt into a puddle of embarrassment.";
		say "     The donkey takes a step back and knocks into a passing incubus, who slides his hand down the donkey's trousers without missing a beat. 'Hey buddy,' the demonic man says with a grin. The donkey boy tries to get the incubus out of his pants, but in so doing he sticks his butt out towards the other man. The demon clearly enjoys the innocent attempt to free himself from the lust demon's grasp. He gropes the ass's ass and whispers something into his ear as he coaxes the equine's cock out of his trousers. The elephant girl lets go of your arm as her apparently former boyfriend is molested, and she walks over towards the pair, no longer interested in you. Embarrassed enough, you decide to let the three have their fun without you.";

You hurry your step and try to move on before they notice you. When they are pretty far behind you, you hear the donkey yell, practically scream, 'You fucked my best friend!' How has he not noticed that everyone's standards have disappeared is beyond you, but thankfully you missed the bullet and continue exploring the campus.";

However, when you turn around you see a figure not too far away from you. Once they realize you've turned around, they futilely hug the sewer wall opposite the dim lights. It's pretty clear this person was following you. You call out to them and wait a moment, and you see their silhouette in the dim light lackadaisically walk away from the wall, just barely being touched by the light. They're wearing a cloak, and even in the darkness of the sewers, this person has their hood up concealing their face. In the hand closest to the light, and therefore the better lit side, you can see your stalker holds a crystal ball in their hand.";

Though you shield your eyes with your arm the first time, the crystal ball flashes a second time and the light hits your eyes, blinding you temporarily. You hear footsteps as your stalker rushes towards you. You try to ready yourself for a fight, but there's no time. Your stalker is closing in. They're right in front of you. They hold the glass ball up to your face. It flashes again. This time, however, you think you see figures moving in the ball. The person tries to tell you something, but you aren't paying attention to them. A sense of vertigo flows over you as the crystal ball is held to your face, but you probably could still get away from this person if you tried.";

There's another monster lurking in the darkness. Thankfully, it isn't paying attention. From behind you, light flashes and you hear a heavy thud. Did the demon brute just succumb to the light as you did? You continue running, trying to turn the same way each time, making a circle to leave the sewers where you came in. Eventually, you find a familiar path, the where you first met that stalker. With your bearings in place, you head back to the mall, leaving the strange cloaked figure behind.";

The air vibrates as the figure speaks. 'How do you plan to survive once the present danger has passed?' You blink a few times and the figure lowers the crystal ball. You can see the figure very clearly now. Before you stands a cloaked man with the face of a whale, and his stature suits his face as he [if ScaleValue of Player < 4]towers over you [else]fills the sewer [end if]in the darkness. You are sure he had not been so large before. Are you still dazed from whatever the crystal ball did to you? Before you get a chance to ask him, he fades into the black behind him. The crystal ball continues to dimly glow for a moment as it seems to float away from you, but then that fades away too.";
		say "     After standing in the sewers for who knows how long, the cotton feeling in your head subsides enough for you to realize where you are. You rush back to the mall, though you are too dizzy to walk straight. It feels like with every breath you take, you forget just a little bit more of this recent encounter. Your mind willing yourself to forget the hooded figure and the images you saw in the... was it a mirror? Or was it a silver dish? You pick up your pace when you realize you don't recall what he looked like. By the time you get to the mall, you wonder why you were in such a hurry to get back. After all, you hadn't done or seen anything in the sewers. But then, if you hadn't done anything, why were you in such a hurry to get back?";
