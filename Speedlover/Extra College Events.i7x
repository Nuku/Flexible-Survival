A female antelope and male cheetah are neck and neck in a race, with legs that blur as they cross ground at an amazing pace. As they close in you notice there is a fence in the way. The antelope goes around it and grabs the metal pole at the edge to slingshot herself to regain some speed while the cheetah jumps over it. They both get back up to full speed again, but the cheetah is now clearly winning. The antelope gives it her best shot, but they both streak past you and cross a finish line - marked out with a bit of tape - before she can catch up.";

	say "     'Hah!' Korvin barks, interrupting the canine student and stepping up right into his comfort zone. 'Real men have nothing to hide. Fur is everything you need!' With that, your anthro attack dog flexes his bicep and runs a hand over the rippling abs of his torso, grinning broadly at the beagle. The student is clearly overwhelmed by Korvin's 'in your face' attitude and is at a loss for words, just staring at the larger man's body and panting excitedly. You can see him stretch his head forward a little, nostrils flaring as he breathes in the masculine scent of your companion standing so very close, followed by his tail starting to wag cautiously. Korvin is quick to pick up on that too, the edges of his muzzle creasing in a toothy, hungry smile.";

	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yeah, why not. Dogs will be dogs and all that...";

	if Player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Placing a hand on the student's shoulder and sliding it up to wrap his fingers behind his neck, Korvin asks, 'What's your name, boy?' Panting hard, the beagle replies, 'G-Gibson, sir!' Pulling the young man closer till his muzzle is pressed against his own furry pecs, Korvin leans forward to lick the side of his face and the floppy ear of the younger canine. 'Good dog, Gib! Someone taught you well to treat a top dog like he deserves!' Your collared dog gives a rough chuckle and lowers a hand to Gibson's crotch. Shivering, the college student takes a deep breath of your attack dog's masculine scent and begins to let his hands wander a bit, carefully pressing them up against Korvin's toned form, as if fearful he might be reprimanded. When one of Gibson's hands gravitate towards his firm buttocks, the German shepherd can't help but grin. 'Getting into the spirit now, aren't you?' he says with amusement in his voice.";
		say "     'Nice bulge, little doggy. Let's see what you're packing,' Korvin barks to his... captive? Eager partner? Fellow dog? All of the above, you'd say. He loosens his grip and allows Gibson to raise his head from the muscled pec it was pressed against, then licks the smaller dog's muzzle. With an aroused growl, Korvin half-leads, half-drags the student into the bushes flanking the walkway.";
		say "     [bold type]Do you want to walk closer and watch?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Anthro dogs humping in rut? Sure!";

		if Player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     Walking closer, you step through the opening between the bushes planted at the edge of the path, finding yourself in the shadow underneath a tree. The place is fairly out of sight from the walkway but open to the grassy meadow between the buildings of the campus. One or two students are lying on the grass nearby, studying or dozing, and a trio farther off to the side is playing with a Frisbee (often catching it with their teeth out of reflex). Gibson's backpack is lying on the ground a step in front of you, while the canine young adult is pushed against the trunk of the tree by Korvin. Your attack dog is quick to peel his college t-shirt off, throwing it your way and chuckling as it hits your head. Pulling the garment off your face - the fresh but at the same time masculine scent of the young dog still in your nose - you drop it next to the student's backpack. By the time you look back at them, Korvin is undoing the smaller canine's zipper.";
			say "     Pulling Gibson's pants down with a sudden and forceful yank, Korvin looks his new friend up and down in all his naked glory. The young man is slender and a bit shorter than him, but still has some nice musculature on his frame. The difference between his and Korvin's breed is fairly obvious: one type is mainly used for tracking, whereas the other is bigger, stronger - suitable for both herding sheep and taking down wolves. Though that's not the only thing that sets them apart - as Korvin points out when he grabs at Gibson's crotch and barks, 'Now what is this?!' His paw-hand wraps around the young man's pink-ish penis, holding the normal human-like appendage up and then stroking it a few times. 'No wonder you were staring at my crotch! You're definitively missing out boy! A sheath and knot are great. But hey, I know how to fix you up,' Korvin adds with a laugh, then pushes on his companion's shoulders.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Too stunned to resist, Gibson soon finds himself crouching down in front of Korvin, staring with wonder at his bright red canine cock. His gaze wanders over the pointy tip, vein-covered shaft, and the bulge at the base, a thick furry sheath nestled just below the knot. 'Wow,' the young dog murmurs under his breath, then reaches out to cup Korvin's balls, gently playing the furry orbs between his fingers. 'Yeah, have a good look at it,' Korvin barks out, pride clearly audible in his voice. He leans over Gibson, bracing himself against the tree as he looks down on the student and letting him touch his erection at his heart's content. The stroking and squeezes that the curious young man gives him aren't without effect, as soon a drop of pre-cum forms at the slit of Korvin's dickhead. You can see him start to reach down to pull Gibson's muzzle to it, but before the German shepherd even touches the other dog, he already has stretched his neck and lapped at Korvin's dick on his own.";
			say "     Gripping the tree tightly with both hand-paws again, Korvin grins down at his student and grunts in arousal as Gibson quickly progresses to taking his shaft in his mouth - helped greatly by the length of a canine muzzle as compared to a human mouth. And so, even as an obvious novice at giving blowjobs, the anthro young adult soon is bobbing up and down on his horny partner's rod - all the while stroking his own shaft with a steady rhythm. Korvin greatly enjoys introducing the beagle to oral male on male sex, instructing him with panted out words of direction, then eventually grasping him by the hair to keep him steady as he proceeds to face-fuck Gibson. It doesn't take long after that until he reaches his climax, taking care to keep his knot out of the anthro student's muzzle as he starts to pump out his creamy cum, covering the young man's tongue and hitting the back of his throat again and again. After all, it wouldn't do to give Gibson a lockjaw at his very first blowjob.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     As Korvin pumps his German shepherd nut-milk into Gibson, grunting in satisfaction as the other canine gobbles it down eagerly, you can see from your close by position that something immediately starts happening to the student's own erection. Its pink-ish human flesh starts to darken second by second, becoming redder in color, and the formerly mushroom-like head reforms to a more pointed shape. Soon, the young man's hand that is gripping the base of his cock starts to be pushed apart a little, and when he pulls back his fingers, you see a fully grown canine knot there too. Grunting around Korvin's muzzle still in his mouth, a jolt goes through the whole of Gibson's body as his newly formed cock erupts, spraying canine seed all over the ground between Korvin's legs.";
			say "     Your collared attack dog keeps gently humping into his partner's muzzle until his own throbs of cum ebb off, then gives the student some time to lick up every last drop of cum and worship his cock some more. Tousling the beagle's short hair and floppy ears, Korvin eventually steps back from the tree and looks down at his now fully anthro canine shape and the puddle of cum on the ground. 'Told ya it'd be fun, Gib!' Still licking his muzzle and checking out his new canine cock, the young man looks up at your companion and replies, 'Thank you, sir. For... everything. That was just... wow.' He makes puppy eyes full of adoration at Korvin, who basks in the feeling - until Gibson suddenly freezes with a somewhat horrified look on his face and looks down to his watch. 'SHIT! I'm late for class!' the student wails, jumping up from where he was leaning back against the tree and snatching up his clothes and backpack before setting off at a sprint, naked. Korvin laughs heartily at the end of his fling with the beagle and takes his usual position by your side again.";

			LineBreak;
			say "     With a shrug to yourself, you simply stand around and wait a bit, casually studying the campus surroundings while hearing moans, grunts and barks coming from the bush Korvin and Gibson vanished behind. But then... that is not the only area close by that one can hear sounds of sex from. Passersby barely raise an eyebrow at the noises of your attack dog and his new partner. Quite a change in behavior to 'normal' human society before the nanite apocalypse...";
			say "     Eventually, Korvin re-emerges from the bushes, a broad grin on his face and his canine shaft still half-hard outside his sheath. It is glistening with wetness, but you can't see a drop of cum on it anywhere... which leaves a pretty easy guess where it all ended up. He takes his usual position by your side with a smirk, looking back to where a pleased and somewhat bewildered-looking Gibson comes stumbling out of the bushes a moment later, still licking his muzzle. Then the young man looks down at his watch and his hackles rise, followed by him letting out a shout of, 'Shit! I'm late for class!' and hurriedly sprinting past you and your companion.";

	else:

		say "     Raising a hand to your mouth, you give a loud and sharp whistle that has both of the anthro canines whirling around to face you. Ordering the black-collared German shepherd to heel, you make eye-contact with Korvin as his lips start to show a little scowl, holding the stare until he looks down submissively a few moments later. With a sidelong glance at the beagle and a bark of, 'So long, pup!' Korvin then trots back over to you, taking his usual position. You hook a finger under the collar marking him as yours and adjust it a little to remind him of his status. Then you pat his head like a good dog and start moving on. The beagle student is left behind, staring after the dominant dog with a sigh of relief - and a sliver of regret.";

to AdminIntro:
	say "     Exploring the campus, you come upon one of the administrative buildings of the college. Surprisingly, it all seems to be in regular use, with students coming and going... seemingly oblivious to the fact that they've almost all been transformed in various ways. You stop one anthro dolphin [one of]guy[or]girl[at random] at random as they try to push past you and go in, asking what's going on. 'Isn't it obvious? People are becoming animals and whatnot - if that's not a reason to re-evaluate the courses you take, what is? The advisory office is in there. I'm gonna go for marine biology, you know.'";
	say "     With that, the student gives a little wave, then enters the building. Your curiosity demands that you check this out in further detail, so you follow inside. The entrance hall is fairly well-filled, with numerous students sitting in small seating groups and chatting, office workers walking along with folders. Seems eerily normal, for any place during the nanite apocalypse. The upside is that nothing is gonna attack you in here, from the looks of it.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Glancing around, you see the tail-fin of your dolphin acquaintance vanish around a corner at the upper end of a stairway to the upper floor. Someone is certainly eager to meet their advisers. Following upwards yourself, you come to the landing of the second floor - but the dolphin isn't anywhere in sight. Hm, too bad. But hey, you know where they were going - there is a sign reading 'Course Adviser's Offices' with an arrow to the right. Following that hint, you soon arrive in a long hallway flanked by a number of doors, with waiting chairs arranged along the sides. No dolphin in sight here either - must have had an appointment and gone in right away.";
	say "     [bold type]Well, the place is pretty peaceful and maybe you could talk with the student some more, or find out what the administrators side on the matter is. Do you want to sit down and wait around a bit?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - At the very least, it'll be relaxing.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Nah, too boring.";
	if Player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Sitting down on a seat, you lean back and wait - and before long, you're not the only one to do so. A muscular young horseman comes down the hallway in a proud stride, his rippling abs and good looks for everyone to see, as his only piece of clothing is a pair of black boxer shorts. Fairly tight ones too, highlighting the sizable bulge at his crotch. 'Hey there, been waiting long?' the student asks with a friendly smile, then shrugs as you shake your head. He sits down opposite to you, and for a little while you each wait in silence, with you casually inspecting the well built dude with his golden coat and long brown hair and tail.";
		say "     Soon, a second student joins you in the waiting area - this one a petite lioness in jeans and a pink shirt that bulges out over a sizable pair of breasts. Like with the horseman, her clothes seem a little tight - a regular sight these days, with all the transformations and changes in asset size going on. 'Hello you two, nice to meet you. I'm Dana.' You introduce yourself in turn and the sexy stud leans back, arms spread and his fingers interlocked behind his head. He clearly loves showing off his muscles.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Then the horseman grins and just says, 'Kyle.' Dana's reaction would have fit him suddenly growing a second head - she gapes in shock, then makes a step back and stares openly at the equine. 'Wait?! Oh god - it IS you! Woooow! I didn't even recognize you until now Kyle,' she gushes, then throws her arms around him as the young man stands up. Exchanging a tight squeeze with the horseman teen, the lioness then turns to look at you a bit closer, as if to check if you're someone she knows too (which you are not).";
		say "     'You won't believe it [if Player is female]ma'am[else]mister[end if], but this guy was, um...' Dana squeezes her friend with one arm and looks up at him while searching for words - only to have him complete the sentence in a fairly amused tone. 'A total wimp. Shorter than her, with flabby arms and incredibly thick glasses. We have physics courses together. Hey Dana - check this out!' With that, the handsome stallion pushes his beautiful mane of brown hair back over his shoulder and raises one arm, flexing awe-inspiring muscles.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Dana is very openly enthralled by his display, giving a quiet little moan as she puts one hand on his chest to feel the firmness and warmth of her friend's body. 'I never told you, but I like you Dana. You've been a good friend and are really beautiful, before and now too. So - how about it, do you like the new me too? This new body feels so great! I'm here to adjust my courses a bit to make room for football,' Kyle says in a hopefully optimistic tone.";
		say "     'Of course I do, silly! You've got the perfect brains and body now! I - um... can I see it?' the slender lioness replies, her hand on his crotch making it obvious what she's referring to. 'You're gonna be amazed!' Kyle says proudly, then pushes his shorts down in a single quick movement, freeing the weighty horsecock and full balls between his legs to dangle freely. Dana is quick to grasp the thick shaft with one hand, stroking its length and panting, 'I can't even get my fingers around it. Just... wow!'";
		say "     [bold type]It seems fairly obvious that the two of them have mostly forgotten that you're still sitting just a few feet away. Do you want to lean back and enjoy the show?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Sure!";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Quietly leave.";
		if Player consents:
			LineBreak;
			say "     'Sit back, I want to show you something too,' Dana tells Kyle, who readily does so - with wide-spread legs, allowing his balls to rest on the edge of the seat cushion and his cock to freely stand at full mast. Coming to stand before him, the petite lioness grins and pulls her top up over her flat belly, then hooks it over her breasts. 'I didn't just get fur and a tail either - look at these!' Dana happily says, squeezing her ample boobs with both hands.";
			say "     It takes only a short moment before you hear the sound of a zipper being opened, followed by the lioness pushing her jeans halfway down her thighs. She slides a hand between her legs and rubs it against the folds of her feline sex, then moans, 'I'm so wet right now!' Leaning forward, a grinning Kyle brushes his larger hand along her furry arm, then feels her pussy and slips a finger inside, taking over rubbing her to stimulate his girlfriend.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The rubbing and touching continues for a little while, with Dana getting fingered and her breasts worshiped and licked by the eager young horseman. Then eventually, she puts a hand on his chest and gently pushes him to lean back once more. Herself sinking to her knees, Dana proceeds to take hold of his cock and licks it with obvious pleasure, then slides her mouth over the flared end and starts to suck. 'Nnngh, yeah!' Kyle lets out in a breathless groan, half-reaching out to guide her before changing his mind and putting his hands behind his head instead, leaving Dana to set the pace.";
			say "     Meanwhile, you're not unaffected by the rising air of lust in this quiet hallway and have slid off those pieces of clothing that hinder you touching yourself. [if Player is male]With a hand on your hard shaft, you stroke slowly along its length[else if Player is female]With a hand on your crotch, you slide your fingers over the sensitive folds of your pussy and frig your clit in a slow but steady manner[else]With a hand on your crotch, you rub your sexless but nonetheless sensitive area[end if] while watching the two students go at it. Soon, Kyle's large black-skinned horsecock is glistening with Dana's spit and visibly throbbing from his arousal. He puts on a lewd grin and asks his girlfriend, 'Wanna try this bad boy out together with me?'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The pretty lioness pulls her muzzle off his dick, then gives its flared head another slow lick before returning an eager smile. 'You couldn't keep me off it if you tried!' she says with a chuckle, then shimmies out of her jeans and stands before her boyfriend, contemplating his thick shaft. 'I wanna sit on it,' she pants in obvious arousal, then climbs on top of her equine lover. Balancing on the young horseman's thighs with her slender paws, the college student looks behind her at Kyle's eager face and swishes her tail in front of his nose.";
			say "     'Catch me, okay?' she asks and receives a confirming nod, then lets herself fall back a little - right into his raised hands, which close around the sides of her hips. Now with her paws braced on his knees and leaning into his support, the young woman bends her legs to lower herself and soon brushes against the tip of his shaft. 'Oooh, I can't wait. Gonna put it in now,' she says in a happy pant and reaches down, aligning his manhood with her pussy. Then she pushes down, with his slick rod parting the wet folds of her sex and sinking several inches into her.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Two voices give a shared gasp full of arousal and need, followed by Kyle's exclamation of, 'Ooh fuck! You feel better than I ever dreamed!' Dana's only reply is a happy giggle as she slides further down, and down - until eventually stopping with just about three inches of his length left outside of her. She gasps, 'I can feel you against my cervix. Damn, you're too big!' With a glance down at his black-skinned erection, she adds, 'And not even all in yet. But... yeah, I think I can take you all the way. The infection must account for such things, from the pairings I've seen out there.'";
			say "     Before her boyfriend can reply, Dana has already raised herself a few inches, then pushes herself down on his manhood with full force. The petite lioness lets out a hoarse shout as her lover bottoms out inside her - creating a visible bulge in her stomach. 'You okay baby?' Kyle asks her, stretching his neck to look her in the eye, but the blissful smile on Dana's face speaks volumes and quells his fear. 'Fuuuck that feels good,' the impaled feline says with a breathless sigh, then cups the bulge in her stomach and pushes it a little bit left and right, playing with his dickhead like that.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Can you... take over for a bit? I'm a bit weak-kneed from having over a foot of cock shoved into me. God, what a thing to say!' Dana tells her equine lover in an amused tone and he is only to happy to comply, starting to slide her up and down on his pole. At first he goes fairly slow, but soon the tempo increases as the petite lioness spurns him on and Kyle's own lust flares hotly... filling the hallway with the rhythmic slap of her ass against his crotch.";
			say "     Their pairing escalates into full-on rutting, which is a glorious spectacle as the powerful stallion takes his lioness friend as his mate, pumping into her with hard thrusts and pulling her down into each and every one of them. Their passion burns incredibly hot, which means it can't last forever, and before much longer, Dana throws her head back and roars in orgasm, her inner muscles trembling around Kyle's shaft.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The squeeze on his prick is enough to push Kyle over the edge in a few heartbeats - especially as her cervix contracts into a very snug ring around his dickhead. With an aroused grunt, he grinds his crotch up against her body as his balls give their first hard throb, blasting a thick throb of cum into her womb. It is awe-inspiring to see Kyle's cum-factories pulse and Dana's stomach grow visibly with each cum-shot, soon giving her a faux-pregnant little bump.";
			say "     In fact, the view of their culmination is enough to move you past the point of no return, and with a wash of pleasure through your whole body, [if Player is male]you start to shoot too, splattering the ground before your seat with long splashes of semen. One of them even hits Kyle (barely), leaving a white splash across his gray hoof[else if Player is female]your pussy starts to drip with femcum, leaking down to leave a little wet spot on the seat[else]your crotch starts to tingle quite nicely[end if]. For a moment, nothing but heavy breathing fills the hallway as the three of you ride out your orgasms, then slowly come back to your senses.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Craning her neck a little, Dana shares a kiss with Kyle, who hugs her lovingly from behind and pants, 'I love you Dana.' She sinks back into his embrace and smiles broadly, then gets very round eyes as her gaze falls upon you. Reflexively trying to jump up and cover herself doesn't lead her very far - not while she is still impaled on her boyfriend's cock. 'Umm... I was gonna say sorry for fucking like bunnies in front of you, but... you enjoyed that, didn't you?' she says and winks after a nod at your own state.";
			say "     With a grin on your face, you wish the two of them well, then stand up. After putting your clothes in order, you then walk down the corridor, leaving the advisers offices of the Tenvale College behind for now. While the place seemed so dreadfully normal and regular before, you now know enough to interpret some low sounds that are audible in the building. That banging from somewhere above surely isn't connected to hanging a picture, and the slurp behind one of the doors you pass will likely be someone giving a blow-job.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     So in the end, this place isn't an exception to the explosion of sexual needs - it's just... a possibility how society might adjust and flourish in a new shape. If all of these workers and students are here, doing their jobs or thinking about their education, they clearly are the best, brightest and most dedicated of the lot - if not them, who else could end up transformed, yet still well-balanced and sane?

Come on, let's make some puppies right here and now!' And with that, he steps up to the young woman and forcefully grabs her by the arm.

Within moments, they surround the kidnapper, the spear-points of their weapons an inch from his throat. Freezing in place, the wolfhound releases his grip on the girl and she wrenches herself free. 'Thanks guys,' she tells the spartan with a relieved expression, then slips out of the circle of combative young men and goes to collect her books.
