Scaled red wings twitch and flap occasionally from his back, but you are not sure whether he could fly with them or not. He wears a silver token on a string around his neck and doesn't ever seem to take it off. Kyrverth spends most of his time in the vault, building up his nest.

He occasionally picks up boxes around the room, showing off his newfound strength. His body shape reminds you of a swimmer - Lithe but with obvious muscle.

A blond mane sits above a large muzzle with large, expressive blue eyes, which look around constantly for threats to his hoard. A mouth filled with sharp teeth, ready to tear into anything that tries to steal from the dragons den, ensures that whatever he spots, won't get away with the treasure. Wide shoulders conceal massive bat-like wings that stretch at times to almost fifty feet wide, you know Kyrverth can fly with them and often see him carrying supplies through the air on his way back to the den. As you look at Kyrverth's long, prehensile tail, you notice something interesting - two [one of]large[or]ponderous[or]bulging[or]vast[or]generous[or]considerable[or]hefty[or]immense[at random] balls sit behind a bulging vent.

Kyrverth takes the token with a smile and runs a cable through it, turning it into an amulet for him to wear around his neck.

You almost drop the food as this time he definitely grows as he puts the bits of chainmail in his hoard. Kyrverth doesn't even seem to notice as his body quickly swells to become an intimidating figure, a little bit taller than you. His wings flap and stretch further and further out from his back, becoming capable of flight. Horns grow through his skin, changing from defensive tools to rather dangerous offensive weapons.

You take a few steps back and drop the supplies to the floor, watching Kyrverth closely. Unlike the previous times his hoard grew, this time Kyrverth changes much more drastically. His entire body seems to bulge in size, growing taller and wider at the same time. He also seems to notice this time, and looks down as his physical power increases. The dragons muscles now seem to be much more toned with an athletic look to them. A small gust of air moves past your face as the drake stretches his wings and his head scratches the ceiling as he touches ten feet tall.";

Kyrverth's hands and feet increase in size disproportionately to his body, claws becoming strong and dangerous but at the same time they force him onto four legs. His tail extends longer, helping him to balance, but a few cracks later and Kyrverth is doomed to walk on four legs from now on - not that he seems to mind. Almost seven foot tall at his shoulder and twenty feet long, the dragon suddenly roars in pleasure and in surprise looks between his front legs back to his groin. In front of two tiny balls, a black penis grows from a vent between his legs. It grows to its full size, an unimpressive six inches, before both penis and balls surge in size. Each ball grows to stretch his sack [one of]to its limit[or]taut[or]tight[at random], then keeps growing until each one is the size of a baseball, and in his pleasure he begins humping into the air. You watch in amazement as the tapered tip begins to extend out from his vent as his penis grows an inch with every thrust until it is almost two feet long! A bulbous knot quickly expands at the base and as Kyrverth goes to grab his penis, but in his haze of pleasure, he barely touches it before he explodes, covering the floor below in semen from his massive sack.";
