His entire body seems to bulge in size, growing taller and wider at the same time. He also seems to notice this time, and looks down as his physical power increases.

His tail extends longer, helping him to balance, but a few cracks later and Kyrverth is doomed to walk on four legs from now on - not that he seems to mind. Almost seven foot tall at his shoulder and twenty feet long, the feral dragon suddenly roars in pleasure and in surprise looks between his front legs back to his groin. In front of two tiny balls, a black [one of]penis[or]cock[or]rod[at random] grows from a vent between his legs. It grows to its full size, an unimpressive six inches, but doesn't stop there. Both penis and balls surge in size. Each ball grows to stretch his sack [one of]to its limit[or]taut[or]tight[at random], then keeps growing until each one is the size of a baseball, and in his pleasure he begins humping into the air. You watch in amazement as the tapered tip begins to extend out from his vent as his penis grows an inch with every thrust until it is almost two feet long! A [one of]bulbous[or]large[or]wide[at random] knot quickly expands at the base and Kyrverth goes to grab his penis, but in his haze of pleasure, he barely touches it before he explodes, covering the floor below in [one of]semen[or]spunk[or]jizz[at random] from his [one of]massive[or]huge[or]bulging[at random] sack.";

Kyrverth lets out a massive roar that echoes throughout the city, putting everyone and everything on warning - there is a new king in town.

A sudden urge strikes, and you take off your shoes and hold the metal against your right foot to compare. The horseshoe is almost as long as your foot but one and a half times wider. The problems begin for you when you try to put it back in your pack. The top of the shoe is stuck to the end of your foot, and when you give it a yank, you nearly dislocate a toe. You let go in reflex to the pain, and the connection between it and your foot begins to tingle like crazy. It feels like that your foot is being split apart as you fall onto your backside.

Your chest and arms are largely unchanged, muscles more toned and covered in chestnut fur, but otherwise about the same as they were. The largest changes are from your waist down.

This is the Kyrverth Jackal King rule:
	if ending "Kyrverth Jackal King" is triggered:
		say "     Upon waking up, you look into the mirror you previously sought out. Looking back at you has [one of]no[or]little[or]barely any[at random] resemblance to what you were before. The mask has changed you completely into a jackal, and considering the markings, probably the jackal king. [if Player is female]Wait, the king? You feel your flat chest. Where did they go? You reach down and feel a telltale bulge. Oh... Your instincts distract you from your gender change and point you towards the rest of your body, and you take it all in. [end if]Standing at almost nine feet tall, your athletic body is toned but thin, and short, black hair covers you from your head to your new paws. Tall, pointed ears let you hear all around, and your handsomeness is accentuated by the golden markings painted on your face and body. Something inside of you nudges your brain away from admiring yourself and on to more pressing matters. A king cannot go without subjects!";

			say "     You immediately head to the mall and grab Nermine. One quick bonk to the head and she is out. You barely feel her weight when you put her on your shoulder and walk out. Nobody there tries to stop the kidnapping as they are all too intimidated to take action. You soon find a place to begin your rule. Nermine tries to escape but finds herself unable to resist against your commands. You find her body quick to change at your words, and soon, there is little left of the sassy shopkeep. It is not long until you and your voluptuous new queen begin to expand your domain. You find yourself able to overpower other infections and soon have a small empire at your command.";
		else: [Ending 2]
			say "     The museum - amusing how where you gained your infection will also be your starting place to spread it. Your incredibly strong infection overpowers others, and you soon find your dominion expanding. Nymphs and Satyrs are changed into jackal servants while sabretooth cats become sabretoothed jackals. It's not long before you don't even need to make contact with an individual[one of], just being nearby causes them to gain jackal traits[or] before they start to gain jackal traits[at random].";

You set up in a nearby city, and it doesn't take long before you control most of it and get yourself appointed mayor.";
			else: [Ending 2b]
				say "     When the army comes in, you and your subjects meet them with force. At first, it is a soldier here and there, but as your 'army' grows, whole squads begin to disappear. By the time the military begins to realize that they are facing an organized enemy, you almost completely control the area. The military has no choice but to negotiate with you, and eventually, you are given the city as yours, as long as you clear out the rest of the infected for the military. The soldiers never notice how a good proportion of infected never make it out; they are just happy they don't have to deal with them any more. As your ranks swell, you have no intention of staying put - already looking towards expanding to other cities.";

This is the Kyrverth Golden Dragon rule:
	if ending "Kyrverth Golden Dragon" is triggered:
		if Player is male or player is herm:
			say "     When the military enters the city, you are asleep and they mistake you for a golden statue at first, you give them a bit of a surprise when the 'statue' wakes up, but you quickly make friends with the soldiers and they escort you to the border wall where you are examined by scientists. Unlike most people they keep you for three days and take lots of samples, especially from your scales. It's not until you ask a nearby colonel what is so interesting about your scales that the scientists are busted, your scales contain gold! They were melting them down, scraping off the organic stuff, and selling it for money. The military quickly issues you with a formal apology and releases you into the world, hoping to sweep it under the rug.";
			LineBreak;
			say "     For a while you drift around from place to place, finding it hard to hold a job other than the hardest of manual labor due to walking on all fours, but eventually you end up in the mountains of Japan. You copy some of the scientists, sell your shedded scales for money and use the money to build a sanctuary deep into the mountains - dedicated to infected people like yourself who have trouble fitting into normal society.";
			say "     Your sanctuary becomes wildly popular, with many infected individuals coming from far and wide to be able to live in peace and not have to worry about making ends meet. Driven by some unknown instinct you have them swear an oath to you before they can enter the sanctuary, making you their lord and protector. At first you do this as a deterrent, to make sure the persons arriving really want to be there, but when the first person makes the oath you find out why the instinct is there - your horns grow! It is an extremely strange sensation to feel them grow out each time someone swears to you, but by the time the arrivals to your sanctuary begin to slow you have a massive pair of what looks like antlers and you are extremely proud of them.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Normal' human media attempts to do a story on your sanctuary a few times, but each time you stop them at a narrow area of the path and stop them from going any further. Your residents are not to be gawked at, they are there to live their lives in peace. Your majestic figure silhouetted against the sun and the idea of the location slowly become legend for the downtrodden infected of society.";
		else if Player is female:
			say "     When the military enters the city, you both greet them with open arms and as soon as you are released you head into distant mountains. Your mate turns out to be able to create gold from thin air, and he uses it to buy a home for you both. The two of you passionately make love regularly and quickly the military determination of 'not infectious' turns out to be a falsehood, first your skin starts to become scales, then you begin to take on more and more draconic traits to match your mate. He delights in your changes and the love between you only deepens when your belly begins to expand with his child.";

	if ending "Kyrverth Racehorse" is triggered:
		say "     After the military comes into the city, you stick with the folks at the Stables. Between regular orgies, you are an athlete of sorts. Representing the stables, you go up against the cheetahs from the Zoo and greyhounds from a gym across the city. You quickly develop a taste for winning, because the best prize isn't the money or mares, but the asses of the losers. Normal sex is sweetened massively by the thrill of victory, and you work hard to win. You put more and more effort into your training, and soon, the Stables is in contention for having the fastest team in the country.";

	if ending "Kyrverth Fighting Tiger" is triggered:
		if the ending flag "Taur Player" is set: [Taur ending]
			say "     The costume has already closed up around you, but hits a snag when your tauric body prevents it from closing completely. The second it has finished changing your main body, you feel a pulse sent backwards and as the pulse passes it makes the hairs on your rear end stand up. Slowly your tauric lower half changes to match your upper half. Looking at yourself, your body looks like one of the Tigertaurs at the zoo - if the Tigertaurs went to the gym. Returning to normal life is a laughable idea, your massive body keeps hitting things by accident and with your changed shape, sitting in an office just isn't an option. The good news is that you don't need to look far to find a new job. The military happily takes you on as you are able to fight like a normal soldier while carrying supplies for the entire group on your back.";
		else if Player is Submissive: [sub ending]
			say "     Your new body shivers, apparently not done changing. A black leather collar materializes around your neck. A black band with a D ring on the front, apparently your form has changed to match your submissive tendencies. Going back to normal life is all but impossible. Your thoughts almost constantly shift to sex and your form intimidates most normal people, at least when they aren't staring at your neck. While the leather collar isn't stuck to you, every time you leave it behind it finds its way back on to you within a few hours. You would suggest teleportation if you didn't know for sure it was impossible. It's not until a misread map leads you into a rather adult club that you find your true calling. While you are distracted someone sneaks up on you and by the time you feel the tug it's already too late, your new master has you leashed. You find yourself unable to resist commands while they hold the leash and are brought back to their house for a new stress free, submissive life.";
			say "     After a while you don't even need the leash anymore, your body, or maybe your mind get accustomed to obeying such a dominant person and you obey [bold type]any[roman type] command. You didn't even realize it was possible, but an offhand comment has your cock shrinking and chest bulging. You always return to your base form after a few hours, but your body obeys commands to change just as readily as commands to move. Never having to worry about money, food, or other mundane concerns feels freeing, and you find yourself wishing this experience will never end.";
		else if Player is Dominant: [Dominant Ending]
			say "     Your new body shivers, apparently not done changing. A black leather harness materializes around your torso. An X across your chest, apparently your form has changed to match your dominant tendencies. Going back to normal life is all but impossible. Your thoughts almost constantly shift to sex and your form intimidates most normal people. While the leather harness on your chest isn't stuck to you, every time you leave it behind it finds its way back on to you within a few hours. You would suggest teleportation if you didn't know for sure it was impossible. The harness gets you some awkward questions when out and about and it's not until a misread map leads you into a gay bar that you find your true calling. Every week you visit a clients house and utterly dominate them for hours on end. This causes both of you great pleasure and at the end of the weekend they always pay handsomely.";
		else: [Normal Ending]
			say "     Going back to normal life is almost impossible, your body looks comical when you sit in the tiny chairs found in an office. At first you try to find work with being an escort, but while the ladies love your size compared to the average tiger, they find out it's just [bold type]too[roman type] big. Eventually you stumble into a gym and the friendly owner quickly takes you under his wing. You quickly find the world of fashion needs more underwear models and the world of celebrities needs more bodyguards. Working with your new friend in the gym, your skills in boxing begin to rise and you start taking on amateur bouts as well. Your new work life pays well, but at the end of the day you are now part tiger, and your body has needs. You find yourself trying the other side of the fence and loving it, since your massive penis seems to be a key that actually fits in many a guys backdoor.";
