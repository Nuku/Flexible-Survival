The room beyond contains shelves of books, scrolls, and maps, while in the center is a large table with another large map on it, along with what look to be small figurines and some dice. In one corner of the room, you can see a bed, a dresser, a side table, posters of anime characters and dragons, and action figures standing posed on the dresser... It is the bedroom of a true nerd, and it seems almost out of place among everything else in the room. 'This is the War Room, and where I live. You can come here to find me and accept your missions,' he explains before walking off, not even giving you a chance to ask further questions.";

Within, you can see chests, armor racks, weapon racks...";

'Greetings,' he says with a slight hiss to his voice, his orange-slitted eyes looked you over as if trying to determine your worth. 'Uska, this is [if player is not defaultnamed][name of player][else]our new recruit[end if]. [if player is not defaultnamed][name of player][else]New recruit[end if], this is Uska Blackheart.

It's lined with wooden fences and pocked with piles of hay, logs, and random stone walls that lead nowhere and block nothing.

This is where we train our mounts and our scouts.'";

Anytime there's a scouting mission, you'll be coming here for a briefing.'

It's where eggs are taken care of and made,' he explains, but didn't stop. Instead he continues on to the last room, much closer to the mouth of the caves, where he stops just outside with a sad look on his face.";
	say "     'I want you to know, we aren't proud of this room, but it is a necessity,' he says before taking a deep breath and opening the door to reveal metal cages, many filled with people with varying levels of kobold infection.

The problem is, we all heal too quickly now. This leaves very few options remaining to pacify foes. We could kill them, but even this is difficult, and we don't want to take control of Avalon through death. We don't have the room or resources to imprison a whole army, like the Champions do, and we refuse to drive the enemy feral, as that is the fate we struggle against ourselves. The only option left...' Tyrin gestures to the captive infected and the vials, '...is to turn them into one of us. Now, this is different than what Gildwing offered you, and if you want details, you can talk to Kona over there.' Tyrin points towards the white kobold who seems too focused on their reading to pay you two any attention. 'Tani also knows some about this since he is the one who deals with the ferals like the ones you saw today. Just know that we only do this because it is the only way we can keep enemies we captured both alive and sane.'";

'I will do what I have to in order to protect the clan, and I hope you will do the same. When you are ready, come to me for your first mission. Until then, I wish you luck.' The chieftain gives you a salute before turning back towards the War Room, leaving you to contemplate your choices. You are now a member of the Gildwing Clan, and you have chosen your side in this war. It's time to see what fate has in store for you now.";
