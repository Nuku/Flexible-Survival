Part 1 - The Arcanologist

instead of going south from Forest Burrow Entrance while (PlayerMet of Arcanologist is false):
	move player to Mysterious Glade;
	say " 	Entering the glade, you are greeted by the sight of a human, or at least you thought he was for a moment. On closer inspection, he is indeed another infected survivor; one who is now sporting elf ears and a wolf tail. Luckily, unlike so many things, the man doesn't seem interested in fighting you in the slightest. Instead, he is on his hands and knees, looking closely at the leaves with a magnifying glass. He wears a beige button-down shirt and a pair of gray jeans; on his back is a seemingly well-equipped backpack, and you can see the corner of a book peeking out of it. The elf's tail wags slowly as he stands up and turns to you.";
	say " 	The elf notices your presence and quickly turns to face you with one hand against the knife on his belt, just in case you were intending to attack, but after a tense few moments, he relaxes. 'Hello, my friend! I hadn't expected to see another sane survivor out here,' he says with a smile. From the front, you can see that he is dashingly handsome. He has green eyes, a chiseled jaw, and his shirt is unbuttoned, showing off his lean, muscled chest and abs. He is one of those guys who is hot enough make a straight guy reconsider his sexuality. The elf adjusts his glasses, then runs his fingers through his messy hair. 'Are you looking for Avalon too?' he asks with an excited look on his face.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say " 	Seeing your confused expression, his excitement only increases. 'Ever since the outbreak, strange tears in our reality have started appearing, and surely you've noticed, but some beings that are now in our world are able to use powers that shouldn't be possible, yet they are. Magic!' His tail wags rapidly, obviously enjoying being able to talk to someone else. 'I want to take this chance to study magic and the creatures that use it. I suppose that you could call me an... Arcanologist,' he says proudly.";
	say " 	'Anyways, I have heard rumors that one of these rifts has opened up in the old Avalon Recreational Park near here, but I can't seem to find the entrance just yet. It's taking its toll too. As you may have guessed, I have had a run in with an elf and a wolf already.' He gestures to his current form. 'But hey! At least I'm hot now!' He adjusts his pack and gives you a winning smile. 'Well, my friend, we should part ways for now. Perhaps next time we meet, it will be in a land of magic!' With that, the Arcanologist leaves the glade, likely to go set up camp or look elsewhere. You can't help but wonder if he was right though. Could there really be an entrance into this, Avalon, within this glade?";
