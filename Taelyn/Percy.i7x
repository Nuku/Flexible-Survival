You begin to wonder what sort of terrible creature would be powerful enough to construct it when you hear the rustle of leaves nearby. Ducking behind a bush, you wait, hiding from or ready to ambush whatever appears.";

His legs are fairly short, giving him a slight wobble to his step, and a long and broad tail stretches behind him. His back is completely covered in thick scales, and his fingers are tipped with powerful looking claws. Despite the reptilian-like traits though, he doesn't look like any kind of lizard that you have seen before.

He squints for a moment, followed by a look of surprise. You quickly stand up out of reflex, ready to fight or run.

Most of the tunnel is the same; a rounded passage carved out by claws and large enough for even larger creatures to pass through relatively unhindered.

The scales that covers his back are a matte-steel color with a yellow-gold trim on the edges. His tail is long and broad, more on the flat side, but still clearly powerful since in his worry, it knocks over a coat rack beside him, sending it rolling across the room for a few feet.

The scales that covers his back are a matte-steel color with a yellow-gold trim on the edges.
